<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>


<p>The present volume is the first of an intended series, which it is hoped will form,
when complete, a cyclopædia of the industry, the want, and the vice of the great
Metropolis.</p>

<p>It is believed that the book is curious for many reasons:</p>

<p>It surely may be considered curious as being the first attempt to publish the
history of a people, from the lips of the people themselves&mdash;giving a literal
description of their labour, their earnings, their trials, and their sufferings, in their
own “unvarnished” language; and to pourtray the condition of their homes and
their families by personal observation of the places, and direct communion with
the individuals.</p>

<p>It may be considered curious also as being the first commission of inquiry into
the state of the people, undertaken by a private individual, and the first “blue
book” ever published in twopenny numbers.</p>

<p>It is curious, moreover, as supplying information concerning a large body of
persons, of whom the public had less knowledge than of the most distant tribes of
the earth&mdash;the government population returns not even numbering them among
the inhabitants of the kingdom; and as adducing facts so extraordinary, that the
traveller in the undiscovered country of the poor must, like Bruce, until his stories
are corroborated by after investigators, be content to lie under the imputation of
telling such tales, as travellers are generally supposed to delight in.</p>

<p>Be the faults of the present volume what they may, assuredly they are rather
short-comings than exaggerations, for in every instance the author and his
coadjutors have sought to understate, and most assuredly never to exceed the
truth. For the omissions, the author would merely remind the reader of the
entire novelty of the task&mdash;there being no other similar work in the language by
which to guide or check his inquiries. When the following leaves are turned over,
and the two or three pages of information derived from books contrasted with the
hundreds of pages of facts obtained by positive observation and investigation,
surely some allowance will be made for the details which may still be left for
others to supply. Within the last two years some thousands of the humbler classes
of society must have been seen and visited with the especial view of noticing their
condition and learning their histories; and it is but right that the truthfulness of
the poor generally should be made known; for though checks have been usually
adopted, the people have been mostly found to be astonishingly correct in their
statements,&mdash;so much so indeed, that the attempts at deception are certainly the
exceptions rather than the rule. Those persons who, from an ignorance of the
simplicity of the honest poor, might be inclined to think otherwise, have, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
to be convinced of the justice of the above remarks, only to consult the details
given in the present volume, and to perceive the extraordinary agreement in the
statements of all the vast number of individuals who have been seen at different
times, and who cannot possibly have been supposed to have been acting in concert.</p>

<p>The larger statistics, such as those of the quantities of fish and fruit, &amp;c., sold
in London, have been collected from tradesmen connected with the several
markets, or from the wholesale merchants belonging to the trade specified&mdash;gentlemen
to whose courtesy and co-operation I am indebted for much valuable information,
and whose names, were I at liberty to publish them, would be an indisputable
guarantee for the facts advanced. The other statistics have been obtained in the
same manner&mdash;the best authorities having been invariably consulted on the subject
treated of.</p>

<p>It is right that I should make special mention of the assistance I have received
in the compilation of the present volume from Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Wood</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard
Knight</span> (late of the City Mission), gentlemen who have been engaged with me
from nearly the commencement of my inquiries, and to whose hearty co-operation
both myself and the public are indebted for a large increase of knowledge. Mr.
Wood, indeed, has contributed so large a proportion of the contents of the present
volume that he may fairly be considered as one of its authors.</p>

<p>The subject of the Street-Folk will still require another volume, in order to complete
it in that comprehensive manner in which I am desirous of executing the
modern history of this and every other portion of the people. There still remain&mdash;the
<i>Street-Buyers</i>, the <i>Street-Finders</i>, the <i>Street-Performers</i>, the <i>Street-Artizans</i>,
and the <i>Street-Labourers</i>, to be done, among the several classes of street-people;
and the <i>Street Jews</i>, the <i>Street Italians and Foreigners</i>, and the <i>Street Mechanics</i>,
to be treated of as varieties of the order. The present volume refers more particularly
to the <i>Street-Sellers</i>, and includes special accounts of the <i>Costermongers</i> and
the <i>Patterers</i> (the two broadly-marked varieties of street tradesmen), the <i>Street
Irish</i>, the <i>Female Street-Sellers</i>, and the <i>Children Street-Sellers</i> of the metropolis.</p>

<p>My earnest hope is that the book may serve to give the rich a more intimate
knowledge of the sufferings, and the frequent heroism under those sufferings, of
the poor&mdash;that it may teach those who are beyond temptation to look with charity on
the frailties of their less fortunate brethren&mdash;and cause those who are in “high
places,” and those of whom much is expected, to bestir themselves to improve the
condition of a class of people whose misery, ignorance, and vice, amidst all the
immense wealth and great knowledge of “the first city in the world,” is, to say the
very least, a national disgrace to us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Of Wandering Tribes in General.</span></h2>

</div>


<p>Of the thousand millions of human beings
that are said to constitute the population
of the entire globe, there are&mdash;socially,
morally, and perhaps even physically considered&mdash;but
two distinct and broadly marked
races, viz., the wanderers and the settlers&mdash;the
vagabond and the citizen&mdash;the nomadic and the
civilized tribes. Between these two extremes,
however, ethnologists recognize a mediate variety,
partaking of the attributes of both. There
is not only the race of hunters and manufacturers&mdash;those
who live by shooting and fishing,
and those who live by producing&mdash;but, say they,
there are also the herdsmen, or those who live
by tending and feeding, what they consume.</p>

<p>Each of these classes has its peculiar and distinctive
physical as well as moral characteristics.
“There are in mankind,” says Dr. Pritchard,
“three principal varieties in the form of the
head and other physical characters. Among the
rudest tribes of men&mdash;the hunters and savage
inhabitants of forests, dependent for their supply
of food on the accidental produce of the soil and
the chase&mdash;a form of head is prevalent which is
mostly distinguished by the term “<i>prognathous</i>,”
indicating a prolongation or extension forward of
the jaws. A second shape of the head belongs
principally to such races as wander with their
herds and flocks over vast plains; these nations
have broad lozenge-shaped faces (owing to the
great development of the cheek bones), and
pyramidal skulls. The most civilized races, on
the other hand&mdash;those who live by the arts of
cultivated life,&mdash;have a shape of the head which
differs from both of those above mentioned. The
characteristic form of the skull among these
nations may be termed oval or elliptical.”</p>

<p>These three forms of head, however, clearly
admit of being reduced to two broadly-marked
varieties, according as the bones of the face or
those of the skull are more highly developed.
A greater relative development of the jaws and
cheek bones, says the author of the “Natural
History of Man,” indicates a more ample extension
of the organs subservient to sensation
and the animal faculties. Such a configuration
is adapted to the wandering tribes; whereas, the
greater relative development of the bones of the
skull&mdash;indicating as it does a greater expansion
of the brain, and consequently of the intellectual
faculties&mdash;is especially adapted to the civilized
races or settlers, who depend mainly on their
knowledge of the powers and properties of things
for the necessaries and comforts of life.</p>

<p>Moreover it would appear, that not only are
all races divisible into wanderers and settlers,
but that each civilized or settled tribe has generally
some wandering horde intermingled with,
and in a measure preying upon, it.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Andrew Smith, who has
recently made extensive observations in South
Africa, almost every tribe of people who have
submitted themselves to social laws, recognizing
the rights of property and reciprocal social
duties, and thus acquiring wealth and forming
themselves into a respectable caste, are surrounded
by hordes of vagabonds and outcasts
from their own community. Such are the Bushmen
and <i>Sonquas</i> of the Hottentot race&mdash;the term
“<i>sonqua</i>” meaning literally <i>pauper</i>. But a
similar condition in society produces similar
results in regard to other races; and the Kafirs
have their Bushmen as well as the Hottentots&mdash;these
are called <i>Fingoes</i>&mdash;a word signifying
wanderers, beggars, or outcasts. The Lappes
seem to have borne a somewhat similar relation
to the Finns; that is to say, they appear to have
been a wild and predatory tribe who sought the
desert like the Arabian Bedouins, while the
Finns cultivated the soil like the industrious
Fellahs.</p>

<p>But a phenomenon still more deserving of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
notice, is the difference of speech between the
Bushmen and the Hottentots. The people of
some hordes, Dr. Andrew Smith assures us, vary
their speech designedly, and adopt new words,
with the intent of rendering their ideas unintelligible
to all but the members of their own
community. For this last custom a peculiar
name exists, which is called “<i>cuze-cat</i>.” This is
considered as greatly advantageous in assisting
concealment of their designs.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a series of facts of the
utmost social importance. (1) There are two
distinct races of men, viz.:&mdash;the wandering
and the civilized tribes; (2) to each of these
tribes a different form of head is peculiar, the
wandering races being remarkable for the development
of the bones of the face, as the
jaws, cheek-bones, &amp;c., and the civilized for
the development of those of the head; (3) to each
civilized tribe there is generally a wandering
horde attached; (4) such wandering hordes
have frequently a different language from the
more civilized portion of the community, and
that adopted with the intent of concealing their
designs and exploits from them.</p>

<p>It is curious that no one has as yet applied
the above facts to the explanation of certain
anomalies in the present state of society among
ourselves. That we, like the Kafirs, Fellahs,
and Finns, are surrounded by wandering hordes&mdash;the
“Sonquas” and the “Fingoes” of this
country&mdash;paupers, beggars, and outcasts, possessing
nothing but what they acquire by depredation
from the industrious, provident, and civilized
portion of the community;&mdash;that the heads
of these nomades are remarkable for the greater
development of the jaws and cheekbones rather
than those of the head;&mdash;and that they have
a secret language of their own&mdash;an English
“<i>cuze-cat</i>” or “slang” as it is called&mdash;for the
concealment of their designs: these are points
of coincidence so striking that, when placed before
the mind, make us marvel that the analogy
should have remained thus long unnoticed.</p>

<p>The resemblance once discovered, however,
becomes of great service in enabling us to use
the moral characteristics of the nomade races
of other countries, as a means of comprehending
the more readily those of the vagabonds and
outcasts of our own. Let us therefore, before
entering upon the subject in hand, briefly run
over the distinctive, moral, and intellectual features
of the wandering tribes in general.</p>

<p>The nomad then is distinguished from the
civilized man by his repugnance to regular
and continuous labour&mdash;by his want of providence
in laying up a store for the future&mdash;by
his inability to perceive consequences ever so
slightly removed from immediate apprehension&mdash;by
his passion for stupefying herbs and roots,
and, when possible, for intoxicating fermented
liquors&mdash;by his extraordinary powers of enduring
privation&mdash;by his comparative insensibility to
pain&mdash;by an immoderate love of gaming, frequently
risking his own personal liberty upon a
single cast&mdash;by his love of libidinous dances&mdash;by
the pleasure he experiences in witnessing the
suffering of sentient creatures&mdash;by his delight in
warfare and all perilous sports&mdash;by his desire
for vengeance&mdash;by the looseness of his notions
as to property&mdash;by the absence of chastity
among his women, and his disregard of female
honour&mdash;and lastly, by his vague sense of religion&mdash;his
rude idea of a Creator, and utter
absence of all appreciation of the mercy of the
Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>Strange to say, despite its privations, its dangers,
and its hardships, those who have once
adopted the savage and wandering mode of life,
rarely abandon it. There are countless examples
of white men adopting all the usages of
the Indian hunter, but there is scarcely one
example of the Indian hunter or trapper adopting
the steady and regular habits of civilized
life; indeed, the various missionaries who have
visited nomade races have found their labours
utterly unavailing, so long as a wandering life
continued, and have succeeded in bestowing
the elements of civilization, only on those
compelled by circumstances to adopt a settled
habitation.</p>


<h3><a id="Of_the_Wandering_Tribes_of_this_Country"></a><span class="smcap">Of the Wandering Tribes of this
Country.</span></h3>

<p>The nomadic races of England are of many
distinct kinds&mdash;from the habitual vagrant&mdash;half-beggar,
half-thief&mdash;sleeping in barns, tents,
and casual wards&mdash;to the mechanic on tramp,
obtaining his bed and supper from the trade
societies in the different towns, on his way to
seek work. Between these two extremes there
are several mediate varieties&mdash;consisting of
pedlars, showmen, harvest-men, and all that
large class who live by either selling, showing,
or doing something through the country.
These are, so to speak, the rural nomads&mdash;not
confining their wanderings to any one particular
locality, but ranging often from one end
of the land to the other. Besides these, there
are the urban and suburban wanderers, or
those who follow some itinerant occupation in
and round about the large towns. Such are,
in the metropolis more particularly, the pickpockets&mdash;the
beggars&mdash;the prostitutes&mdash;the
street-sellers&mdash;the street-performers&mdash;the cabmen&mdash;the
coachmen&mdash;the watermen&mdash;the sailors
and such like. In each of these classes&mdash;according
as they partake more or less of the
purely vagabond, doing nothing whatsoever for
their living, but moving from place to place
preying upon the earnings of the more industrious
portion of the community, so will the
attributes of the nomade tribes be found to be
more or less marked in them. Whether it be
that in the mere act of wandering, there is a
greater determination of blood to the surface of
the body, and consequently a less quantity
sent to the brain, the muscles being thus
nourished at the expense of the mind, I leave
physiologists to say. But certainly be the physical
cause what it may, we must all allow that
in each of the classes above-mentioned, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a greater development of the animal than of the
intellectual or moral nature of man, and that
they are all more or less distinguished for their
high cheek-bones and protruding jaws&mdash;for
their use of a slang language&mdash;for their lax
ideas of property&mdash;for their general improvidence&mdash;their
repugnance to continuous labour&mdash;their
disregard of female honour&mdash;their love
of cruelty&mdash;their pugnacity&mdash;and their utter
want of religion.</p>


<h3><a id="Of_the_London_Street-folk"></a><span class="smcap">Of the London Street-folk.</span></h3>

<p>Those who obtain their living in the streets of
the metropolis are a very large and varied class;
indeed, the means resorted to in order “to
pick up a crust,” as the people call it, in the
public thoroughfares (and such in many instances
it <i>literally</i> is,) are so multifarious that the mind
is long baffled in its attempts to reduce them to
scientific order or classification.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that the street-people
may be all arranged under six distinct
genera or kinds.</p>

<p>These are severally:</p>

<ul>
<li>I.          <span class="smcap">Street-sellers.</span></li>
<li>II.           <span class="smcap">Street-buyers.</span></li>
<li>III.          <span class="smcap">Street-Finders.</span></li>
<li>IV.          <span class="smcap">Street-Performers, Artists, and Showmen.</span></li>
<li>V.          <span class="smcap">Street-Artizans</span>, or <span class="smcap">Working Pedlars</span>; and</li>
<li>VI.          <span class="smcap">Street-Labourers.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>The first of these divisions&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Street-Sellers</span>&mdash;includes
many varieties; viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Street-sellers of Fish, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;“wet,” “dry,”
and shell-fish&mdash;and poultry, game, and cheese.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Street-sellers of Vegetables</i>, fruit (both
“green” and “dry”), flowers, trees, shrubs,
seeds, and roots, and “green stuff” (as water-cresses,
chickweed and grun’sel, and turf).</p>

<p>3. <i>The Street-sellers of Eatables and Drinkables</i>,&mdash;including
the vendors of fried fish, hot eels,
pickled whelks, sheep’s trotters, ham sandwiches,
peas’-soup, hot green peas, penny pies, plum
“duff,” meat-puddings, baked potatoes, spice-cakes,
muffins and crumpets, Chelsea buns,
sweetmeats, brandy-balls, cough drops, and cat
and dog’s meat&mdash;such constituting the principal
eatables sold in the street; while under the head
of street-drinkables may be specified tea and
coffee, ginger-beer, lemonade, hot wine, new milk
from the cow, asses milk, curds and whey, and
occasionally water.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Street-sellers of Stationery, Literature,
and the Fine Arts</i>&mdash;among whom are comprised
the flying stationers, or standing and running
patterers; the long-song-sellers; the wall-song-sellers
(or “pinners-up,” as they are technically
termed); the ballad sellers; the vendors of play-bills,
second editions of newspapers, back numbers
of periodicals and old books, almanacks,
pocket books, memorandum books, note paper,
sealing-wax, pens, pencils, stenographic cards,
valentines, engravings, manuscript music,
images, and gelatine poetry cards.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Street-sellers of Manufactured Articles</i>,
which class comprises a large number of individuals,
as, (<i>a</i>) the vendors of chemical articles
of manufacture&mdash;viz., blacking, lucifers, corn-salves,
grease-removing compositions, plating-balls,
poison for rats, crackers, detonating-balls,
and cigar-lights. (<i>b</i>) The vendors of metal
articles of manufacture&mdash;razors and pen-knives,
tea-trays, dog-collars, and key-rings, hardware,
bird-cages, small coins, medals, jewellery, tin-ware,
tools, card-counters, red-herring-toasters,
trivets, gridirons, and Dutch ovens. (<i>c</i>) The
vendors of china and stone articles of manufacture&mdash;as
cups and saucers, jugs, vases, chimney
ornaments, and stone fruit. (<i>d</i>) The vendors of
linen, cotton, and silken articles of manufacture&mdash;as
sheeting, table-covers, cotton, tapes and
thread, boot and stay-laces, haberdashery, pretended
smuggled goods, shirt-buttons, etc., etc.;
and (<i>e</i>) the vendors of miscellaneous articles of
manufacture&mdash;as cigars, pipes, and snuff-boxes,
spectacles, combs, “lots,” rhubarb, sponges,
wash-leather, paper-hangings, dolls, Bristol toys,
sawdust, and pin-cushions.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Street-sellers of Second-hand Articles</i>,
of whom there are again four separate classes;
as (<i>a</i>) those who sell old metal articles&mdash;viz.
old knives and forks, keys, tin-ware, tools, and
marine stores generally; (<i>b</i>) those who sell old
linen articles&mdash;as old sheeting for towels; (<i>c</i>)
those who sell old glass and crockery&mdash;including
bottles, old pans and pitchers, old looking
glasses, &amp;c.; and (<i>d</i>) those who sell old miscellaneous
articles&mdash;as old shoes, old clothes, old
saucepan lids, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Street-sellers of Live Animals</i>&mdash;including
the dealers in dogs, squirrels, birds, gold and
silver fish, and tortoises.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Street-sellers of Mineral Productions and
Curiosities</i>&mdash;as red and white sand, silver sand,
coals, coke, salt, spar ornaments, and shells.</p>

<p>These, so far as my experience goes, exhaust
the whole class of street-sellers, and they appear
to constitute nearly three-fourths of the entire
number of individuals obtaining a subsistence in
the streets of London.</p>

<p>The next class are the <span class="smcap">Street-Buyers</span>, under
which denomination come the purchasers of hareskins,
old clothes, old umbrellas, bottles, glass,
broken metal, rags, waste paper, and dripping.</p>

<p>After these we have the <span class="smcap">Street-Finders</span>, or
those who, as I said before, literally “pick up”
their living in the public thoroughfares. They are
the “pure” pickers, or those who live by gathering
dogs’-dung; the cigar-end finders, or “hard-ups,”
as they are called, who collect the refuse
pieces of smoked cigars from the gutters, and
having dried them, sell them as tobacco to the
very poor; the dredgermen or coal-finders; the
mud-larks, the bone-grubbers; and the sewer-hunters.</p>

<p>Under the fourth division, or that of the
<span class="smcap">Street-Performers, Artists, and Showmen</span>,
are likewise many distinct callings.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Street-Performers</i>, who admit of being
classified into (<i>a</i>) mountebanks&mdash;or those who
enact puppet-shows, as Punch and Judy, the fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>toccini,
and the Chinese shades. (<i>b</i>) The street-performers
of feats of strength and dexterity&mdash;as
“acrobats” or posturers, “equilibrists” or
balancers, stiff and bending tumblers, jugglers,
conjurors, sword-swallowers, “salamanders” or
fire-eaters, swordsmen, etc. (<i>c</i>) The street-performers
with trained animals&mdash;as dancing
dogs, performing monkeys, trained birds and
mice, cats and hares, sapient pigs, dancing bears,
and tame camels. (<i>d</i>) The street-actors&mdash;as
clowns, “Billy Barlows,” “Jim Crows,” and
others.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Street Showmen</i>, including shows of
(<i>a</i>) extraordinary persons&mdash;as giants, dwarfs,
Albinoes, spotted boys, and pig-faced ladies.
(<i>b</i>) Extraordinary animals&mdash;as alligators, calves,
horses and pigs with six legs or two heads, industrious
fleas, and happy families. (<i>c</i>) Philosophic
instruments&mdash;as the microscope, telescope,
thaumascope. (<i>d</i>) Measuring-machines&mdash;as
weighing, lifting, measuring, and striking machines;
and (<i>e</i>) miscellaneous shows&mdash;such as
peep-shows, glass ships, mechanical figures,
wax-work shows, pugilistic shows, and fortune-telling
apparatus.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Street-Artists</i>&mdash;as black profile-cutters,
blind paper-cutters, “screevers” or draughtsmen
in coloured chalks on the pavement, writers
without hands, and readers without eyes.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Street Dancers</i>&mdash;as street Scotch girls,
sailors, slack and tight rope dancers, dancers on
stilts, and comic dancers.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Street Musicians</i>&mdash;as the street bands
(English and German), players of the guitar,
harp, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, dulcimer, musical
bells, cornet, tom-tom, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Street Singers</i>, as the singers of glees,
ballads, comic songs, nigger melodies, psalms,
serenaders, reciters, and improvisatori.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Proprietors of Street Games</i>, as swings,
highflyers, roundabouts, puff-and-darts, rifle
shooting, down the dolly, spin-’em-rounds, prick
the garter, thimble-rig, etc.</p>

<p>Then comes the Fifth Division of the Street-Folk,
viz., the <span class="smcap">Street-Artizans</span>, or <span class="smcap">Working
Pedlars</span>;</p>

<p>These may be severally arranged into three
distinct groups&mdash;(1) Those who <i>make</i> things in
the streets; (2) Those who <i>mend</i> things in the
streets; and (3) Those who <i>make</i> things <i>at home</i>
and <i>sell</i> them in the <i>streets</i>.</p>

<p>1. Of <i>those who make things in the streets</i> there
are the following varieties: (<i>a</i>) the metal
workers&mdash;such as toasting-fork makers, pin
makers, engravers, tobacco-stopper makers.
(<i>b</i>) The textile-workers&mdash;stocking-weavers, cabbage-net
makers, night-cap knitters, doll-dress
knitters. (<i>c</i>) The miscellaneous workers,&mdash;the
wooden spoon makers, the leather brace and garter
makers, the printers, and the glass-blowers.</p>

<p>2. <i>Those who mend things in the streets</i>, consist
of broken china and glass menders, clock menders,
umbrella menders, kettle menders, chair menders,
grease removers, hat cleaners, razor and knife
grinders, glaziers, travelling bell hangers, and
knife cleaners.</p>

<p>3. <i>Those who make things at home and sell them
in the streets</i>, are (<i>a</i>) the wood workers&mdash;as the
makers of clothes-pegs, clothes-props, skewers,
needle-cases, foot-stools and clothes-horses,
chairs and tables, tea-caddies, writing-desks,
drawers, work-boxes, dressing-cases, pails and
tubs. (<i>b</i>) The trunk, hat, and bonnet-box
makers, and the cane and rush basket makers.
(<i>c</i>) The toy makers&mdash;such as Chinese roarers,
children’s windmills, flying birds and fishes,
feathered cocks, black velvet cats and sweeps,
paper houses, cardboard carriages, little copper
pans and kettles, tiny tin fireplaces, children’s
watches, Dutch dolls, buy-a-brooms, and gutta-percha
heads. (<i>d</i>) The apparel makers&mdash;viz.,
the makers of women’s caps, boys and men’s
cloth caps, night-caps, straw bonnets, children’s
dresses, watch-pockets, bonnet shapes, silk
bonnets, and gaiters. (<i>e</i>) The metal workers,&mdash;as
the makers of fire-guards, bird-cages, the
wire workers. (<i>f</i>) The miscellaneous workers&mdash;or
makers of ornaments for stoves, chimney
ornaments, artificial flowers in pots and in nose-gays,
plaster-of-Paris night-shades, brooms,
brushes, mats, rugs, hearthstones, firewood, rush
matting, and hassocks.</p>

<p>Of the last division, or <span class="smcap">Street-Labourers</span>,
there are four classes:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Cleansers</i>&mdash;such as scavengers, nightmen,
flushermen, chimney-sweeps, dustmen,
crossing-sweepers, “street-orderlies,” labourers
to sweeping-machines and to watering-carts.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Lighters and Waterers</i>&mdash;or the turncocks
and the lamplighters.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Street-Advertisers</i>&mdash;viz., the bill-stickers,
bill-deliverers, boardmen, men to advertising
vans, and wall and pavement stencillers.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Street-Servants</i>&mdash;as horse holders, link-men,
coach-hirers, street-porters, shoe-blacks.</p>


<h3><a id="Of_the_Number_of_Costermongers_and_other_Street-folk"></a><span class="smcap">Of the Number of Costermongers and
other Street-folk.</span></h3>

<p>The number of costermongers,&mdash;that it is to
say, of those street-sellers attending the London
“green” and “fish markets,”&mdash;appears to be,
from the best data at my command, now 30,000
men, women, and children. The census of 1841
gives only 2,045 “hawkers, hucksters, and pedlars,”
in the metropolis, and no costermongers
or street-sellers, or street-performers at all. This
number is absurdly small, and its absurdity is
accounted for by the fact that not one in twenty
of the costermongers, or of the people with whom
they lodged, troubled themselves to fill up the
census returns&mdash;the majority of them being unable
to read and write, and others distrustful of
the purpose for which the returns were wanted.</p>

<p>The costermongering class extends itself
yearly; and it is computed that for the last five
years it has increased considerably faster than
the general metropolitan population. This increase
is derived partly from <i>all</i> the children of
costermongers following the father’s trade, but
chiefly from working men, such as the servants
of greengrocers or of innkeepers, when out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
employ, “taking to a coster’s barrow” for a livelihood;
and the same being done by mechanics
and labourers out of work. At the time of
the famine in Ireland, it is calculated, that the
number of Irish obtaining a living in the London
streets must have been at least doubled.</p>

<p>The great discrepancy between the government
returns and the accounts of the costermongers
themselves, concerning the number of
people obtaining a living by the sale of fish,
fruit, and vegetables, in the streets of London,
caused me to institute an inquiry at the several
metropolitan markets concerning the number of
street-sellers attending them: the following is
the result:</p>

<p>During the summer months and fruit season,
the average number of costermongers attending
Covent-garden market is about 2,500 per market-day.
In the strawberry season there are nearly
double as many, there being, at that time, a large
number of Jews who come to buy; during that
period, on a Saturday morning, from the commencement
to the close of the market, as many
as 4,000 costers have been reckoned purchasing
at Covent-garden. Through the winter
season, however, the number of costermongers
does not exceed upon the average 1,000 per
market morning. About one-tenth of the fruit
and vegetables of the least expensive kind sold
at this market is purchased by the costers.
Some of the better class of costers, who have
their regular customers, are very particular as
to the quality of the articles they buy; but
others are not so particular; so long as they
can get things cheap, I am informed, they do
not care much about the quality. The Irish
more especially look out for damaged articles,
which they buy at a low price. One of my
informants told me that the costers were the
best customers to the growers, inasmuch as
when the market is flagging on account of the
weather, they (the costers) wait and make their
purchases. On other occasions, such as fine
mornings, the costers purchase as early as others.
There is no trust given to them&mdash;to use the
words of one of my informants, they are such
slippery customers; here to-day and gone
to-morrow.</p>

<p>At Leadenhall market, during the winter
months, there are from 70 to 100 costermongers
general attendants; but during the summer not
much more than one-half that number make
their appearance. Their purchases consist of
warren-rabbits, poultry, and game, of which
about one-eighth of the whole amount brought
to this market is bought by them. When the
market is slack, and during the summer, when
there is “no great call” for game, etc., the
costers attending Leadenhall-market turn their
hand to crockery, fruit, and fish.</p>

<p>The costermongers frequenting Spitalfields-market
average all the year through from 700
to 1,000 each market-day. They come from all
parts, as far as Edmonton, Edgeware, and Tottenham;
Highgate, Hampstead, and even from
Greenwich and Lewisham. Full one-third of
the produce of this market is purchased by
them.</p>

<p>The number of costermongers attending the
Borough-market is about 250 during the fruit
season, after which time they decrease to about
200 per market morning. About one-sixth of
the produce that comes into this market is
purchased by the costermongers. One gentleman
informed me, that the salesmen might shut
up their shops were it not for these men. “In
fact,” said another, “I don’t know what would
become of the fruit without them.”</p>

<p>The costers at Billingsgate-market, daily,
number from 3,000 to 4,000 in winter, and about
2,500 in summer. A leading salesman told me
that he would rather have an order from a costermonger
than a fishmonger; for the one paid ready
money, while the other required credit. The
same gentleman assured me, that the costermongers
bought excellent fish, and that very
largely. They themselves aver that they purchase
half the fish brought to Billingsgate&mdash;some
fish trades being entirely in their hands.
I ascertained, however, from the authorities at
Billingsgate, and from experienced salesmen,
that of the quantity of fish conveyed to that
great mart, the costermongers bought one-third;
another third was sent into the country;
and another disposed of to the fishmongers, and
to such hotel-keepers, or other large purchasers,
as resorted to Billingsgate.</p>

<p>The salesmen at the several markets all
agreed in stating that no trust was given to the
costermongers. “Trust them!” exclaimed one,
“O, certainly, as far as I can see them.”</p>

<p>Now, adding the above figures together, we have
the subjoined sum for the gross number of</p>


<h4>COSTERMONGERS ATTENDING THE LONDON
MARKETS.</h4>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Besides these, I am credibly informed, that it
may be assumed there are full 1,000 men who
are unable to attend market, owing to the dissipation
of the previous night; another 1,000 are
absent owing to their having “stock on hand,”
and so requiring no fresh purchases; and further,
it may be estimated that there are at least
2,000 boys in London at work for costers, at
half profits, and who consequently have no occasion
to visit the markets. Hence, putting these
numbers together, we arrive at the conclusion
that there are in London upwards of 13,000
street-sellers, dealing in fish, fruit, vegetables,
game, and poultry alone. To be on the safe
side, however, let us assume the number of London
costermongers to be 12,000, and that one-half
of these are married and have two children
(which from all accounts appears to be about the
proportion); and then we have 30,000 for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sum total of men, women, and children dependent
on “costermongering” for their subsistence.</p>

<p>Large as this number may seem, still I am
satisfied it is rather within than beyond the
truth. In order to convince myself of its accuracy,
I caused it to be checked in several ways.
In the first place, a survey was made as to the
number of stalls in the streets of London&mdash;forty-six
miles of the principal thoroughfares were
travelled over, and an account taken of the
“standings.” Thus it was found that there were
upon an average upwards of fourteen stalls to
the mile, of which five-sixths were fish and fruit-stalls.
Now, according to the Metropolitan
Police Returns, there are 2,000 miles of street
throughout London, and calculating that the
stalls through the whole of the metropolis run
upon an average only four to the mile, we shall
thus find that there are 8,000 stalls altogether
in London; of these we may reckon that at least
6,000 are fish and fruit-stalls. I am informed,
on the best authority, that twice as many costers
“go rounds” as have standings; hence we come
to the conclusion that there are 18,000 itinerant
and stationary street-sellers of fish, vegetables,
and fruit, in the metropolis; and reckoning the
same proportion of wives and children as before,
we have thus 45,000 men, women, and children,
obtaining a living in this manner. Further,
“to make assurance doubly sure,” the street-markets
throughout London were severally
visited, and the number of street-sellers at each
taken down on the spot. These gave a grand
total of 3,801, of which number two-thirds were
dealers in fish, fruit, and vegetables; and reckoning
that twice as many costers again were on
their rounds, we thus make the total number of
London costermongers to be 11,403, or calculating
men, women, and children, 28,506. It
would appear, therefore, that if we estimate the
gross number of individuals subsisting on the
sale of fish, fruit, and vegetables, in the streets
of London, at between twenty-five and thirty thousand,
we shall not be very wide of the truth.</p>

<p>But, great as is this number, still the costermongers
are only a portion of the street-folk.
Besides these, there are, as we have seen, many
other large classes obtaining their livelihood in
the streets. The street musicians, for instance,
are said to number 1,000, and the old clothesmen
the same. There are supposed to be at
the least 500 sellers of water-cresses; 200 coffee-stalls;
300 cats-meat men; 250 ballad-singers;
200 play-bill sellers; from 800 to
1,000 bone-grubbers and mud-larks; 1,000
crossing-sweepers; another thousand chimney-sweeps,
and the same number of turncocks
and lamp-lighters; all of whom, together with
the street-performers and showmen, tinkers,
chair, umbrella, and clock-menders, sellers
of bonnet-boxes, toys, stationery, songs, last
dying-speeches, tubs, pails, mats, crockery,
blacking, lucifers, corn-salves, clothes-pegs,
brooms, sweetmeats, razors, dog-collars, dogs,
birds, coals, sand,&mdash;scavengers, dustmen, and
others, make up, it may be fairly assumed,
full thirty thousand adults, so that, reckoning
men, women, and children, we may truly say
that there are upwards of fifty thousand individuals,
or about a fortieth-part of the entire
population of the metropolis getting their living
in the streets.</p>

<p>Now of all modes of obtaining subsistence,
that of street-selling is the most precarious.
Continued wet weather deprives those who
depend for their bread upon the number of
people frequenting the public thoroughfares of
all means of living; and it is painful to think
of the hundreds belonging to this class in
the metropolis who are reduced to starvation by
three or four days successive rain. Moreover,
in the winter, the street-sellers of fruit and
vegetables are cut off from the ordinary means
of gaining their livelihood, and, consequently,
they have to suffer the greatest privations at a
time when the severity of the season demands
the greatest amount of physical comforts. To
expect that the increased earnings of the summer
should be put aside as a provision against
the deficiencies of the winter, is to expect that
a precarious occupation should beget provident
habits, which is against the nature of things,
for it is always in those callings which are the
most uncertain, that the greatest amount of improvidence
and intemperance are found to exist.
It is not the well-fed man, be it observed, but
the starving one that is in danger of surfeiting
himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, when the religious, moral, and
intellectual degradation of the great majority of
these fifty thousand people is impressed upon
us, it becomes positively appalling to contemplate
the vast amount of vice, ignorance
and want, existing in these days in the very
heart of our land. The public have but to
read the following plain unvarnished account of
the habits, amusements, dealings, education,
politics, and religion of the London costermongers
in the nineteenth century, and then
to say whether they think it safe&mdash;even if it be
thought fit&mdash;to allow men, women, and children
to continue in such a state.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Varieties of Street-folk in
general, and Costermongers in particular.</span></h3>

<p>Among the street-folk there are many distinct
characters of people&mdash;people differing as
widely from each in tastes, habits, thoughts
and creed, as one nation from another. Of
these the costermongers form by far the largest
and certainly the mostly broadly marked class.
They appear to be a distinct race&mdash;perhaps,
originally, of Irish extraction&mdash;seldom associating
with any other of the street-folks, and
being all known to each other. The “patterers,”
or the men who cry the last dying-speeches,
&amp;c. in the street, and those who help
off their wares by long harrangues in the public
thoroughfares, are again a separate class. These,
to use their own term, are “the aristocracy of
the street-sellers,” despising the costers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
their ignorance, and boasting that they live by
their intellect. The public, they say, do not
expect to receive from them an equivalent
for their money&mdash;they pay to hear them
talk. Compared with the costermongers,
the patterers are generally an educated class,
and among them are some classical scholars,
one clergyman, and many sons of gentlemen.
They appear to be the counterparts of the old
mountebanks or street-doctors. As a body
they seem far less improvable than the costers,
being more “knowing” and less impulsive. The
street-performers differ again from those; these
appear to possess many of the characteristics of
the lower class of actors, viz., a strong desire to
excite admiration, an indisposition to pursue
any settled occupation, a love of the tap-room,
though more for the society and display than
for the drink connected with it, a great fondness
for finery and predilection for the performance
of dexterous or dangerous feats. Then
there are the street mechanics, or artizans&mdash;quiet,
melancholy, struggling men, who, unable
to find any regular employment at their own
trade, have made up a few things, and taken to
hawk them in the streets, as the last shift of
independence. Another distinct class of street-folk
are the blind people (mostly musicians in a
rude way), who, after the loss of their eyesight,
have sought to keep themselves from the workhouse
by some little excuse for alms-seeking.
These, so far as my experience goes, appear to
be a far more deserving class than is usually
supposed&mdash;their affliction, in most cases, seems
to have chastened them and to have given a
peculiar religious cast to their thoughts.</p>

<p>Such are the several varieties of street-folk,
intellectually considered&mdash;looked at in a national
point of view, they likewise include many distinct
people. Among them are to be found the
Irish fruit-sellers; the Jew clothesmen; the
Italian organ boys, French singing women,
the German brass bands, the Dutch buy-a-broom
girls, the Highland bagpipe players,
and the Indian crossing-sweepers&mdash;all of whom
I here shall treat of in due order.</p>

<p>The costermongering class or order has also
its many varieties. These appear to be in the
following proportions:&mdash;One-half of the entire
class are costermongers proper, that is to say,
the calling with them is hereditary, and perhaps
has been so for many generations; while the
other half is composed of three-eighths Irish,
and one-eighth mechanics, tradesmen, and Jews.</p>

<p>Under the term “costermonger” is here included
only such “street-sellers” as deal in fish,
fruit, and vegetables, purchasing their goods at
the wholesale “green” and fish markets. Of these
some carry on their business at the same stationary
stall or “standing” in the street, while
others go on “rounds.” The itinerant costermongers,
as contradistinguished from the stationary
street-fishmongers and greengrocers, have
in many instances regular rounds, which they go
daily, and which extend from two to ten miles.
The longest are those which embrace a suburban
part; the shortest are through streets thickly peopled
by the poor, where duly to “work” a single
street consumes, in some instances, an hour.
There are also “chance” rounds. Men “working”
these carry their wares to any part in which
they hope to find customers. The costermongers,
moreover, diversify their labours by occasionally
going on a country round, travelling on these
excursions, in all directions, from thirty to ninety
and even a hundred miles from the metropolis.
Some, again, confine their callings chiefly to the
neighbouring races and fairs.</p>

<p>Of all the characteristics attending these diversities
of traders, I shall treat severally.
I may here premise, that the regular or
“thorough-bred costermongers,” repudiate the
numerous persons who sell only nuts or oranges
in the streets, whether at a fixed stall, or any
given locality, or who hawk them through the
thoroughfares or parks. They repudiate also
a number of Jews, who confine their street-trading
to the sale of “coker-nuts” on Sundays,
vended from large barrows. Nor do they rank
with themselves the individuals who sell tea and
coffee in the streets, or such condiments as
peas-soup, sweetmeats, spice-cakes, and the
like; those articles not being purchased at the
markets. I often heard all such classes called
“the illegitimates.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Costermongering Mechanics.</span></h3>

<p>“From the numbers of mechanics,” said one
smart costermonger to me, “that I know of
in my own district, I should say there’s now
more than 1,000 costers in London that were
once mechanics or labourers. They are driven
to it as a last resource, when they can’t get
work at their trade. They don’t do well, at least
four out of five, or three out of four don’t.
They’re not up to the dodges of the business.
They go to market with fear, and don’t know
how to venture a bargain if one offers. They’re
inferior salesmen too, and if they have fish
left that won’t keep, it’s a dead loss to them,
for they aren’t up to the trick of selling it
cheap at a distance where the coster ain’t known;
or of quitting it to another, for candle-light sale,
cheap, to the Irish or to the ‘lushingtons,’ that
haven’t a proper taste for fish. Some of these
poor fellows lose every penny. They’re mostly
middle-aged when they begin costering. They’ll
generally commence with oranges or herrings.
We pity them. We say, ‘Poor fellows! they’ll
find it out by-and-bye.’ It’s awful to see some
poor women, too, trying to pick up a living in
the streets by selling nuts or oranges. It’s
awful to see them, for they can’t set about it
right; besides that, there’s too many before they
start. They don’t find a living, <i>it’s only another
way of starving</i>.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ancient Calling of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The earliest record of London cries is,
according to Mr. Charles Knight, in Lydgate’s
poem of “London Lyckpeny,” which is as
old as the days of Henry V., or about 430<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
years back. Among Lydgate’s cries are enumerated
“Strawberries ripe and cherries in
the rise;” the <i>rise</i> being a twig to which the
cherries were tied, as at present. Lydgate,
however, only indicates costermongers, but does
not mention them by name.</p>

<p>It is not my intention, as my inquiries are
directed to the <i>present</i> condition of the costermongers,
to dwell on this part of the question,
but some historical notice of so numerous a body
is indispensable. I shall confine myself therefore
to show from the elder dramatists, how
the costermongers flourished in the days of
Elizabeth and James I.</p>

<p>“Virtue,” says Shakespeare, “is of so little
regard in these <i>coster-monger times</i>, that true
valour is turned bear-herd.” Costermonger
times are as old as any trading times of
which our history tells; indeed, the stationary
costermonger of our own day is a legitimate
descendant of the tradesmen of the olden time,
who stood by their shops with their open casements,
loudly inviting buyers by praises of their
wares, and by direct questions of “What d’ye
buy? What d’ye lack?”</p>

<p>Ben Jonson makes his <i>Morose</i>, who hated all
noises, and sought for a silent wife, enter “upon
divers treaties with the fish-wives and orange-women,”
to moderate their clamour; but <i>Morose</i>,
above all other noisy people, “cannot endure a
costard-monger; he swoons if he hear one.”</p>

<p>In Ford’s “Sun’s Darling” I find the following:
“Upon my life he means to turn
costermonger, and is projecting how to forestall
the market. I shall cry pippins rarely.”</p>

<p>In Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Scornful Lady”
is the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Pray, sister, do not laugh; you’ll anger him,</div>
       <div class="verse">And then he’ll rail like a rude costermonger.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dr. Johnson, gives the derivation of costard-monger
(the orthography he uses), as derived
from the sale of apples or costards, “round
and bulky like the head;” and he cites Burton
as an authority: “Many country vicars,” writes
Burton, “are driven to shifts, and if our great
patrons hold us to such conditions, they will
make us <i>costard-mongers</i>, graziers, or sell ale.”</p>

<p>“The costard-monger,” says Mr. Charles
Knight, in his “London,” “was originally an
apple-seller, whence his name, and, from the
mention of him in the old dramatists, he appears
to have been frequently an Irishman.”</p>

<p>In Ireland the word “costermonger” is almost
unknown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Obsolete Cries of the
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>A brief account of the cries once prevalent
among the street-sellers will show somewhat
significantly the change in the diet or regalements
of those who purchase their food in the
street. Some of the articles are not vended in
the public thoroughfares now, while others are
still sold, but in different forms.</p>

<p>“Hot sheep’s feet,” for instance, were cried
in the streets in the time of Henry V.; they are
now sold <i>cold</i>, at the doors of the lower-priced
theatres, and at the larger public-houses. Among
the street cries, the following were common
prior to the wars of the Roses: “Ribs of
beef,”&mdash;“Hot peascod,”&mdash;and “Pepper and
saffron.” These certainly indicate a different
street diet from that of the present time.</p>

<p>The following are more modern, running from
Elizabeth’s days down to our own. “Pippins,”
and, in the times of Charles II., and subsequently,
oranges were sometimes cried as
“Orange pips,”&mdash;“Fair lemons and oranges;
oranges and citrons,”&mdash;“New Wall-fleet oysters,”
[“<i>fresh</i>” fish was formerly cried as
“new,”]&mdash;“New-river water,” [I may here
mention that water-carriers still ply their trade
in parts of Hampstead,]&mdash;“Rosemary and
lavender,”&mdash;“Small coals,” [a cry rendered
almost poetical by the character, career, and
pitiful end, through a practical joke, of Tom
Britton, the “small-coal man,”]&mdash;“Pretty
pins, pretty women,”&mdash;“Lilly-white vinegar,”&mdash;“Hot
wardens” (pears)&mdash;“Hot codlings,”&mdash;and
lastly the greasy-looking beverage which
Charles Lamb’s experience of London at early
morning satisfied him was of all preparations
the most grateful to the stomach of the then
existing climbing-boys&mdash;viz., “Sa-loop.” I
may state, for the information of my younger
readers, that saloop (spelt also “salep” and
“salop”) was prepared, as a powder, from
the root of the <i>Orchis mascula</i>, or Red-handed
Orchis, a plant which grows luxuriantly in our
meadows and pastures, flowering in the spring,
though never cultivated to any extent in this
country; that required for the purposes of commerce
was imported from India. The saloop-stalls
were superseded by the modern coffee-stalls.</p>

<p>There were many other cries, now obsolete,
but what I have cited were the most common.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers “economically”
considered.</span></h3>

<p>Political economy teaches us that, between
the two great classes of producers and consumers,
stand the distributors&mdash;or dealers&mdash;saving
time, trouble, and inconvenience to, the
one in disposing of, and to the other in purchasing,
their commodities.</p>

<p>But the distributor was not always a part and
parcel of the economical arrangements of the
State. In olden times, the producer and consumer
were brought into immediate contact, at
markets and fairs, holden at certain intervals.
The inconvenience of this mode of operation,
however, was soon felt; and the pedlar, or
wandering distributor, sprang up as a means of
carrying the commodities to those who were
unable to attend the public markets at the
appointed time. Still the pedlar or wandering
distributor was not without <i>his</i> disadvantages.
He only came at certain periods, and commodities
were occasionally required in the interim.
Hence the shopkeeper, or stationary distributor,
was called into existence, so that the consumer
might obtain any commodity of the producer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
any time he pleased. Hence we see that the
pedlar is the primitive tradesman, and that the
one is contradistinguished from the other by the
fact, that the pedlar carries the goods to the consumer,
whereas, in the case of the shopkeeper,
the consumer goes after the goods. In country
districts, remote from towns and villages, the
pedlar is not yet wholly superseded; “but a
dealer who has a fixed abode, and fixed customers,
is so much more to be depended on,” says Mr.
Stewart Mill, “that consumers prefer resorting
to him if he is conveniently accessible, and
dealers, therefore, find their advantage in establishing
themselves in every locality where there
are sufficient customers near at hand to afford
them a remuneration.” Hence the pedlar is
now chiefly confined to the poorer districts, and
is consequently distinguished from the stationary
tradesman by the character and means of his
customers, as well as by the amount of capital
and extent of his dealings. The shopkeeper
supplies principally the noblemen and gentry
with the necessaries and luxuries of life, but the
pedlar or hawker is the purveyor in general to
the poor. He brings the greengrocery, the fruit,
the fish, the water-cresses, the shrimps, the pies
and puddings, the sweetmeats, the pine-apples,
the stationery, the linendrapery, and the jewellery,
such as it is, to the very door of the
working classes; indeed, the poor man’s food
and clothing are mainly supplied to him in this
manner. Hence the class of travelling tradesmen
are important, not only as forming a large
portion of the poor themselves, but as being the
persons through whom the working people obtain
a considerable part of their provisions and
raiment.</p>

<p>But the itinerant tradesman or street-seller is
still further distinguished from the regular fixed
dealer&mdash;the <i>stall</i>keeper from the <i>shop</i>keeper&mdash;the
<i>street</i>-wareman from the ware<i>house</i>man, by
the arts they respectively employ to attract
custom. The street-seller cries his goods aloud
at the head of his barrow; the enterprising
tradesman distributes bills at the door of his
shop. The one appeals to the ear, the other to
the eye. The cutting costermonger has a drum
and two boys to excite attention to his stock;
the spirited shopkeeper has a column of advertisements
in the morning newspapers. They are
but different means of attaining the same end.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The London Street Markets on a
Saturday Night.</span></h3>

<p>The street sellers are to be seen in the greatest
numbers at the London street markets on a
Saturday night. Here, and in the shops immediately
adjoining, the working-classes generally
purchase their Sunday’s dinner; and after
pay-time on Saturday night, or early on
Sunday morning, the crowd in the New-cut,
and the Brill in particular, is almost impassable.
Indeed, the scene in these parts has
more of the character of a fair than a market.
There are hundreds of stalls, and every
stall has its one or two lights; either it is
illuminated by the intense white light of the
new self-generating gas-lamp, or else it is
brightened up by the red smoky flame of the old-fashioned
grease lamp. One man shows off his
yellow haddock with a candle stuck in a bundle
of firewood; his neighbour makes a candlestick
of a huge turnip, and the tallow gutters over its
sides; whilst the boy shouting “Eight a penny,
stunning pears!” has rolled his dip in a thick
coat of brown paper, that flares away with the
candle. Some stalls are crimson with the fire
shining through the holes beneath the baked
chestnut stove; others have handsome octohedral
lamps, while a few have a candle shining
through a sieve: these, with the sparkling
ground-glass globes of the tea-dealers’ shops,
and the butchers’ gaslights streaming and fluttering
in the wind, like flags of flame, pour forth
such a flood of light, that at a distance the atmosphere
immediately above the spot is as lurid
as if the street were on fire.</p>

<p>The pavement and the road are crowded with
purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife
in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on
her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now to look
at the stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch
of greens. Little boys, holding three or four
onions in their hand, creep between the people,
wriggling their way through every interstice, and
asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking
charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different
cries of the eager dealers, all shouting at
the top of their voices, at one and the same
time, is almost bewildering. “So-old again,”
roars one. “Chestnuts all ’ot, a penny a score,”
bawls another. “An ’aypenny a skin, blacking,”
squeaks a boy. “Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy&mdash;bu-u-uy!”
cries the butcher. “Half-quire of
paper for a penny,” bellows the street stationer.
“An ’aypenny a lot ing-uns.” “Twopence a
pound grapes.” “Three a penny Yarmouth
bloaters.” “Who’ll buy a bonnet for fourpence?”
“Pick ’em out cheap here! three
pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces.” “Now’s your
time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot.” “Here’s
ha’p’orths,” shouts the perambulating confectioner.
“Come and look at ’em! here’s
toasters!” bellows one with a Yarmouth
bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. “Penny a lot,
fine russets,” calls the apple woman: and so
the Babel goes on.</p>

<p>One man stands with his red-edged mats
hanging over his back and chest, like a herald’s
coat; and the girl with her basket of walnuts
lifts her brown-stained fingers to her mouth, as
she screams, “Fine warnuts! sixteen a penny,
fine war-r-nuts.” A bootmaker, to “ensure
custom,” has illuminated his shop-front with
a line of gas, and in its full glare stands a blind
beggar, his eyes turned up so as to show
only “the whites,” and mumbling some
begging rhymes, that are drowned in the shrill
notes of the bamboo-flute-player next to him.
The boy’s sharp cry, the woman’s cracked
voice, the gruff, hoarse shout of the man,
are all mingled together. Sometimes an Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>man
is heard with his “fine ating apples;” or
else the jingling music of an unseen organ
breaks out, as the trio of street singers rest
between the verses.</p>

<p>Then the sights, as you elbow your way
through the crowd, are equally multifarious.
Here is a stall glittering with new tin saucepans;
there another, bright with its blue and
yellow crockery, and sparkling with white
glass. Now you come to a row of old shoes
arranged along the pavement; now to a stand
of gaudy tea-trays; then to a shop with red
handkerchiefs and blue checked shirts, fluttering
backwards and forwards, and a counter
built up outside on the kerb, behind which
are boys beseeching custom. At the door of
a tea-shop, with its hundred white globes of
light, stands a man delivering bills, thanking
the public for past favours, and “defying competition.”
Here, alongside the road, are some
half-dozen headless tailors’ dummies, dressed in
Chesterfields and fustian jackets, each labelled,
“Look at the prices,” or “Observe the quality.”
After this is a butcher’s shop, crimson and white
with meat piled up to the first-floor, in front
of which the butcher himself, in his blue coat,
walks up and down, sharpening his knife on the
steel that hangs to his waist. A little further
on stands the clean family, begging; the father
with his head down as if in shame, and a box
of lucifers held forth in his hand&mdash;the boys in
newly-washed pinafores, and the tidily got-up
mother with a child at her breast. This stall is
green and white with bunches of turnips&mdash;that
red with apples, the next yellow with onions,
and another purple with pickling cabbages.
One minute you pass a man with an umbrella
turned inside up and full of prints; the
next, you hear one with a peepshow of Mazeppa,
and Paul Jones the pirate, describing
the pictures to the boys looking in at the
little round windows. Then is heard the
sharp snap of the percussion-cap from the crowd
of lads firing at the target for nuts; and the
moment afterwards, you see either a black man
half-clad in white, and shivering in the cold
with tracts in his hand, or else you hear the
sounds of music from “Frazier’s Circus,” on
the other side of the road, and the man outside
the door of the penny concert, beseeching you to
“Be in time&mdash;be in time!” as Mr. Somebody
is just about to sing his favourite song of the
“Knife Grinder.” Such, indeed, is the riot,
the struggle, and the scramble for a living,
that the confusion and uproar of the New-cut
on Saturday night have a bewildering and
saddening effect upon the thoughtful mind.</p>

<p>Each salesman tries his utmost to sell his
wares, tempting the passers-by with his bargains.
The boy with his stock of herbs offers
“a double ’andful of fine parsley for a penny;”
the man with the donkey-cart filled with turnips
has three lads to shout for him to their utmost,
with their “Ho! ho! hi-i-i! What do you
think of this here? A penny a bunch&mdash;hurrah
for free trade! <i>Here’s</i> your turnips!” Until
it is seen and heard, we have no sense of the
scramble that is going on throughout London
for a living. The same scene takes place at the
Brill&mdash;the same in Leather-lane&mdash;the same in
Tottenham-court-road&mdash;the same in Whitecross-street;
go to whatever corner of the metropolis
you please, either on a Saturday night or a
Sunday morning, and there is the same shouting
and the same struggling to get the penny profit
out of the poor man’s Sunday’s dinner.</p>

<p>Since the above description was written, the
New Cut has lost much of its noisy and brilliant
glory. In consequence of a New Police regulation,
“stands” or “pitches” have been forbidden,
and each coster, on a market night, is now
obliged, under pain of the lock-up house, to
carry his tray, or keep moving with his barrow.
The gay stalls have been replaced by deal boards,
some sodden with wet fish, others stained purple
with blackberries, or brown with walnut-peel;
and the bright lamps are almost totally superseded
by the dim, guttering candle. Even if
the pole under the tray or “shallow” is seen
resting on the ground, the policeman on duty is
obliged to interfere.</p>

<p>The mob of purchasers has diminished one-half;
and instead of the road being filled with
customers and trucks, the pavement and kerb-stones
are scarcely crowded.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sunday Morning Markets.</span></h3>

<p>Nearly every poor man’s market does its Sunday
trade. For a few hours on the Sabbath
morning, the noise, bustle, and scramble of the
Saturday night are repeated, and but for this
opportunity many a poor family would pass a
dinnerless Sunday. The system of paying the
mechanic late on the Saturday night&mdash;and more
particularly of paying a man his wages in a
public-house&mdash;when he is tired with his day’s
work, lures him to the tavern, and there the
hours fly quickly enough beside the warm tap-room
fire, so that by the time the wife comes
for her husband’s wages, she finds a large
portion of them gone in drink, and the streets
half cleared, so that the Sunday market is the
only chance of getting the Sunday’s dinner.</p>

<p>Of all these Sunday-morning markets, the
Brill, perhaps, furnishes the busiest scene; so
that it may be taken as a type of the whole.</p>

<p>The streets in the neighbourhood are quiet
and empty. The shops are closed with their
different-coloured shutters, and the people round
about are dressed in the shiney cloth of the
holiday suit. There are no “cabs,” and but few
omnibuses to disturb the rest, and men walk in
the road as safely as on the footpath.</p>

<p>As you enter the Brill the market sounds are
scarcely heard. But at each step the low hum
grows gradually into the noisy shouting, until
at last the different cries become distinct, and
the hubbub, din, and confusion of a thousand
voices bellowing at once again fill the air.
The road and footpath are crowded, as on the
over-night; the men are standing in groups,
smoking and talking; whilst the women run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to and fro, some with the white round turnips
showing out of their filled aprons, others with
cabbages under their arms, and a piece of red
meat dangling from their hands. Only a few of
the shops are closed, but the butcher’s and the
coal-shed are filled with customers, and from
the door of the shut-up baker’s, the women come
streaming forth with bags of flour in their hands,
while men sally from the halfpenny barber’s
smoothing their clean-shaved chins. Walnuts,
blacking, apples, onions, braces, combs, turnips,
herrings, pens, and corn-plaster, are all bellowed
out at the same time. Labourers and mechanics,
still unshorn and undressed, hang about with
their hands in their pockets, some with their
pet terriers under their arms. The pavement is
green with the refuse leaves of vegetables, and
round a cabbage-barrow the women stand
turning over the bunches, as the man shouts,
“Where you like, only a penny.” Boys are
running home with the breakfast herring held
in a piece of paper, and the side-pocket of
the apple-man’s stuff coat hangs down with
the weight of the halfpence stored within it.
Presently the tolling of the neighbouring church
bells breaks forth. Then the bustle doubles
itself, the cries grow louder, the confusion
greater. Women run about and push their way
through the throng, scolding the saunterers, for
in half an hour the market will close. In a
little time the butcher puts up his shutters, and
leaves the door still open; the policemen in their
clean gloves come round and drive the street-sellers
before them, and as the clock strikes
eleven the market finishes, and the Sunday’s
rest begins.</p>

<p>We find, from the foregoing list of markets,
held in the various thoroughfares of the metropolis,
that there are 10 on the Surrey side and
27 on the Middlesex side of the Thames. The
total number of hucksters attending these
markets is 3,911, giving an average of 105 to
each market.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Habits and Amusements of
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I find it impossible to separate these two headings;
for the habits of the costermonger are not
domestic. His busy life is past in the markets
or the streets, and as his leisure is devoted to
the beer-shop, the dancing-room, or the theatre,
we must look for his habits to his demeanour at
those places. Home has few attractions to a
man whose life is a street-life. Even those who
are influenced by family ties and affections,
prefer to “home”&mdash;indeed that word is rarely
mentioned among them&mdash;the conversation,
warmth, and merriment of the beer-shop, where
they can take their ease among their “mates.”
Excitement or amusement are indispensable to
uneducated men. Of beer-shops resorted to
by costermongers, and principally supported by
them, it is computed that there are 400 in
London.</p>

<p>Those who meet first in the beer-shop talk
over the state of trade and of the markets, while
the later comers enter at once into what may
be styled the serious business of the evening&mdash;amusement.</p>

<p>Business topics are discussed in a most
peculiar style. One man takes the pipe from
his mouth and says, “Bill made a doogheno
hit this morning.” “Jem,” says another, to
a man just entering, “you’ll stand a top o’
reeb?” “On,” answers Jem, “I’ve had a
trosseno tol, and have been doing dab.” For
an explanation of what may be obscure in
this dialogue, I must refer my readers to my
remarks concerning the language of the class.
If any strangers are present, the conversation
is still further clothed in slang, so as to be
unintelligible even to the partially initiated.
The evident puzzlement of any listener is
of course gratifying to the costermonger’s
vanity, for he feels that he possesses a knowledge
peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>Among the in-door amusements of the costermonger
is card-playing, at which many of them
are adepts. The usual games are all-fours, all-fives,
cribbage, and put. Whist is known to a
few, but is never played, being considered dull
and slow. Of short whist they have not heard;
“but,” said one, whom I questioned on the
subject, “if it’s come into fashion, it’ll soon be
among us.” The play is usually for beer, but
the game is rendered exciting by bets both
among the players and the lookers-on. “I’ll back
Jem for a yanepatine,” says one. “Jack for a
gen,” cries another. A penny is the lowest sum
laid, and five shillings generally the highest, but
a shilling is not often exceeded. “We play fair
among ourselves,” said a costermonger to me&mdash;“aye,
fairer than the aristocrats&mdash;but we’ll take
in anybody else.” Where it is known that the
landlord will not supply cards, “a sporting
coster” carries a pack or two with him. The
cards played with have rarely been stamped;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
they are generally dirty, and sometimes almost
illegible, from long handling and spilled beer.
Some men will sit patiently for hours at these
games, and they watch the dealing round of the
dingy cards intently, and without the attempt&mdash;common
among politer gamesters&mdash;to appear
indifferent, though they bear their losses well. In
a full room of card-players, the groups are all
shrouded in tobacco-smoke, and from them are
heard constant sounds&mdash;according to the games
they are engaged in&mdash;of “I’m low, and Ped’s
high.” “Tip and me’s game.” “Fifteen four
and a flush of five.” I may remark it is curious
that costermongers, who can neither read nor
write, and who have no knowledge of the multiplication
table, are skilful in all the intricacies
and calculations of cribbage. There is not much
quarrelling over the cards, unless strangers play
with them, and then the costermongers all take
part one with another, fairly or unfairly.</p>

<p>It has been said that there is a close resemblance
between many of the characteristics of
a very high class, socially, and a very low class.
Those who remember the disclosures on a trial
a few years back, as to how men of rank and
wealth passed their leisure in card-playing&mdash;many
of their lives being one continued leisure&mdash;can
judge how far the analogy holds when the
card-passion of the costermongers is described.</p>

<p>“Shove-halfpenny” is another game played
by them; so is “Three up.” Three halfpennies
are thrown up, and when they fall all “heads”
or all “tails,” it is a mark; and the man who
gets the greatest number of marks out of a
given amount&mdash;three, or five, or more&mdash;wins.
“Three-up” is played fairly among the costermongers;
but is most frequently resorted to
when strangers are present to “make a pitch,”&mdash;which
is, in plain words, to cheat any stranger
who is rash enough to bet upon them. “This is
the way, sir,” said an adept to me; “bless you, I
can make them fall as I please. If I’m playing
with Jo, and a stranger bets with Jo, why, of
course, I make Jo win.” This adept illustrated
his skill to me by throwing up three halfpennies,
and, five times out of six, they fell upon the floor,
whether he threw them nearly to the ceiling or
merely to his shoulder, all heads or all tails.
The halfpence were the proper current coins&mdash;indeed,
they were my own; and the result is
gained by a peculiar position of the coins on the
fingers, and a peculiar jerk in the throwing.
There was an amusing manifestation of the
pride of art in the way in which my obliging
informant displayed his skill.</p>

<p>“Skittles” is another favourite amusement,
and the costermongers class themselves among
the best players in London. The game is always
for beer, but betting goes on.</p>

<p>A fondness for “sparring” and “boxing”
lingers among the rude members of some classes
of the working men, such as the tanners. With
the great majority of the costermongers this
fondness is still as dominant as it was among the
“higher classes,” when boxers were the pets of
princes and nobles. The sparring among the
costers is not for money, but for beer and “a
lark”&mdash;a convenient word covering much mischief.
Two out of every ten landlords, whose
houses are patronised by these lovers of “the
art of self-defence,” supply gloves. Some charge
2<i>d.</i> a night for their use; others only 1<i>d.</i> The
sparring seldom continues long, sometimes not
above a quarter of an hour; for the costermongers,
though excited for a while, weary of sports in
which they cannot personally participate, and in
the beer-shops only two spar at a time, though
fifty or sixty may be present. The shortness of
the duration of this pastime may be one reason
why it seldom leads to quarrelling. The stake
is usually a “top of reeb,” and the winner is the
man who gives the first “noser;” a <i>bloody</i> nose
however is required to show that the blow was
veritably a noser. The costermongers boast of
their skill in pugilism as well as at skittles.
“We are all handy with our fists,” said one man,
“and are matches, aye, and more than matches,
for anybody but reg’lar boxers. We’ve stuck to
the ring, too, and gone reg’lar to the fights, more
than any other men.”</p>

<p>“Twopenny-hops” are much resorted to by
the costermongers, men and women, boys and
girls. At these dances decorum is sometimes,
but not often, violated. “The women,” I was
told by one man, “doesn’t show their necks as
I’ve seen the ladies do in them there pictures of
high life in the shop-winders, or on the stage.
Their Sunday gowns, which is their dancing
gowns, ain’t made that way.” At these “hops”
the clog-hornpipe is often danced, and sometimes
a collection is made to ensure the performance
of a first-rate professor of that dance;
sometimes, and more frequently, it is volunteered
gratuitously. The other dances are jigs, “flash
jigs”&mdash;hornpipes in fetters&mdash;a dance rendered
popular by the success of the acted “Jack Sheppard”&mdash;polkas,
and country-dances, the last-mentioned
being generally demanded by the
women. Waltzes are as yet unknown to them.
Sometimes they do the “pipe-dance.” For this
a number of tobacco-pipes, about a dozen, are
laid close together on the floor, and the dancer
places the toe of his boot between the different
pipes, keeping time with the music. Two of the
pipes are arranged as a cross, and the toe has to
be inserted between each of the angles, without
breaking them. The numbers present at these
“hops” vary from 30 to 100 of both sexes, their
ages being from 14 to 45, and the female sex
being slightly predominant as to the proportion
of those in attendance. At these “hops” there
is nothing of the leisurely style of dancing&mdash;half
a glide and half a skip&mdash;but vigorous, laborious
capering. The hours are from half-past eight to
twelve, sometimes to one or two in the morning,
and never later than two, as the costermongers
are early risers. There is sometimes a good deal
of drinking; some of the young girls being often
pressed to drink, and frequently yielding to the
temptation. From 1<i>l.</i> to 7<i>l.</i> is spent in drink at
a hop; the youngest men or lads present spend
the most, especially in that act of costermonger
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
politeness&mdash;“treating the gals.” The music is
always a fiddle, sometimes with the addition of
a harp and a cornopean. The band is provided
by the costermongers, to whom the assembly is
confined; but during the present and the last
year, when the costers’ earnings have been less
than the average, the landlord has provided the
harp, whenever that instrument has added to
the charms of the fiddle. Of one use to which
these “hops” are put I have given an account,
under the head of “Marriage.”</p>

<p>“Here Pertaters! Kearots and Turnups! Fine Brockello-o-o!”</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The other amusements of this class of the
community are the theatre and the penny concert,
and their visits are almost entirely confined
to the galleries of the theatres on the Surrey-side&mdash;the
Surrey, the Victoria, the Bower Saloon,
and (but less frequently) Astley’s. Three times
a week is an average attendance at theatres and
dances by the more prosperous costermongers.
The most intelligent man I met with among
them gave me the following account. He classes
himself with the many, but his tastes are really
those of an educated man:&mdash;“Love and murder
suits us best, sir; but within these few years I
think there’s a great deal more liking for deep
tragedies among us. They set men a thinking;
but then we all consider them too long. Of <i>Hamlet</i>
we can make neither end nor side; and nine
out of ten of us&mdash;ay, far more than that&mdash;would
like it to be confined to the ghost scenes, and the
funeral, and the killing off at the last. <i>Macbeth</i>
would be better liked, if it was only the witches
and the fighting. The high words in a tragedy
we call jaw-breakers, and say we can’t tumble
to that barrikin. We always stay to the last,
because we’ve paid for it all, or very few costers
would see a tragedy out if any money was returned
to those leaving after two or three acts.
We are fond of music. Nigger music was very
much liked among us, but it’s stale now. Flash
songs are liked, and sailors’ songs, and patriotic
songs. Most costers&mdash;indeed, I can’t call to
mind an exception&mdash;listen very quietly to songs
that they don’t in the least understand. We
have among us translations of the patriotic French
songs. ‘Mourir pour la patrie’ is very popular,
and so is the ‘Marseillaise.’ A song to take hold
of us must have a good chorus.” “They like
something, sir, that is worth hearing,” said one of
my informants, “such as the ‘Soldier’s Dream,’
‘The Dream of Napoleon,’ or ‘I ’ad a dream&mdash;an
’appy dream.’”</p>

<p>The songs in ridicule of Marshal Haynau, and
in laudation of Barclay and Perkin’s draymen,
were and are very popular among the costers;
but none are more popular than Paul Jones&mdash;“A
noble commander, Paul Jones was his name.”
Among them the chorus of “Britons never shall
be slaves,” is often rendered “Britons always
shall be slaves.” The most popular of all songs
with the class, however, is “Duck-legged Dick,”
of which I give the first verse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Duck-legged Dick had a donkey,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And his lush loved much for to swill,</div>
       <div class="verse">One day he got rather lumpy,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And got sent seven days to the mill.</div>
       <div class="verse">His donkey was taken to the green-yard,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">A fate which he never deserved.</div>
       <div class="verse">Oh! it was such a regular mean yard,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">That alas! the poor moke got starved.</div>
       <div class="verse">Oh! bad luck can’t be prevented,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Fortune she smiles or she frowns,</div>
       <div class="verse">He’s best off that’s contented,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To mix, sirs, the ups and the downs.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Their sports, are enjoyed the more, if they
are dangerous and require both courage and
dexterity to succeed in them. They prefer, if
crossing a bridge, to climb over the parapet, and
walk along on the stone coping. When a house
is building, rows of coster lads will climb up
the long ladders, leaning against the unslated
roof, and then slide down again, each one resting
on the other’s shoulders. A peep show
with a battle scene is sure of its coster audience,
and a favourite pastime is fighting with cheap
theatrical swords. They are, however, true to
each other, and should a coster, who is the hero
of his court, fall ill and go to a hospital, the
whole of the inhabitants of his quarter will visit
him on the Sunday, and take him presents of
various articles so that “he may live well.”</p>

<p>Among the men, rat-killing is a favourite
sport. They will enter an old stable, fasten the
door and then turn out the rats. Or they will
find out some unfrequented yard, and at night
time build up a pit with apple-case boards, and
lighting up their lamps, enjoy the sport.
Nearly every coster is fond of dogs. Some
fancy them greatly, and are proud of making
them fight. If when out working, they see
a handsome stray, whether he is a “toy” or
“sporting” dog, they whip him up&mdash;many of
the class not being <i>very</i> particular whether the
animals are stray or not.</p>

<p>Their dog fights are both cruel and frequent.
It is not uncommon to see a lad walking with
the trembling legs of a dog shivering under a
bloody handkerchief, that covers the bitten and
wounded body of an animal that has been figuring
at some “match.” These fights take place
on the sly&mdash;the tap-room or back-yard of a beer-shop,
being generally chosen for the purpose.
A few men are let into the secret, and they attend
to bet upon the winner, the police being carefully
kept from the spot.</p>

<p>Pigeons are “fancied” to a large extent,
and are kept in lath cages on the roofs of the
houses. The lads look upon a visit to the Red-house,
Battersea, where the pigeon-shooting
takes place, as a great treat. They stand without
the hoarding that encloses the ground, and
watch for the wounded pigeons to fall, when a
violent scramble takes place among them, each
bird being valued at 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> So popular has
this sport become, that some boys take dogs
with them trained to retrieve the birds, and two
Lambeth costers attend regularly after their
morning’s work with their guns, to shoot those
that escape the ‘shots’ within.</p>

<p>A good pugilist is looked up to with great admiration
by the costers, and fighting is considered
to be a necessary part of a boy’s education.
Among them cowardice in any shape is despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as being degrading and loathsome, indeed the
man who would avoid a fight, is scouted by the
whole of the court he lives in. Hence it is
important for a lad and even a girl to know
how to “work their fists well”&mdash;as expert
boxing is called among them. If a coster man
or woman is struck they are obliged to fight.
When a quarrel takes place between two boys,
a ring is formed, and the men urge them on to
have it out, for they hold that it is a wrong
thing to stop a battle, as it causes bad blood
for life; whereas, if the lads fight it out they
shake hands and forget all about it. Everybody
practises fighting, and the man who has
the largest and hardest muscle is spoken of
in terms of the highest commendation. It is
often said in admiration of such a man that
“he could muzzle half a dozen bobbies before
breakfast.”</p>

<p>To serve out a policeman is the bravest act
by which a costermonger can distinguish himself.
Some lads have been imprisoned upwards
of a dozen times for this offence; and are consequently
looked upon by their companions
as martyrs. When they leave prison for such
an act, a subscription is often got up for their
benefit. In their continual warfare with the
force, they resemble many savage nations, from
the cunning and treachery they use. The lads
endeavour to take the unsuspecting “crusher”
by surprise, and often crouch at the entrance of
a court until a policeman passes, when a stone or
a brick is hurled at him, and the youngster immediately
disappears. Their love of revenge too,
is extreme&mdash;their hatred being in no way
mitigated by time; they will wait for months,
following a policeman who has offended or
wronged them, anxiously looking out for an
opportunity of paying back the injury. One
boy, I was told, vowed vengeance against a
member of the force, and for six months never
allowed the man to escape his notice. At
length, one night, he saw the policeman in a
row outside a public-house, and running into
the crowd kicked him savagely, shouting at the
same time: “Now, you b&mdash;&mdash;, I’ve got you
at last.” When the boy heard that his persecutor
was injured for life, his joy was very
great, and he declared the twelvemonth’s imprisonment
he was sentenced to for the offence to
be “dirt cheap.” The whole of the court where
the lad resided sympathized with the boy, and
vowed to a man, that had he escaped, they
would have subscribed a pad or two of dry herrings,
to send him into the country until the
affair had blown over, for he had shown himself
a “plucky one.”</p>

<p>It is called “plucky” to bear pain without
complaining. To flinch from expected
suffering is scorned, and he who does so is
sneered at and told to wear a gown, as being
more fit to be a woman. To show a disregard
for pain, a lad, when without money, will say to
his pal, “Give us a penny, and you may have
a punch at my nose.” They also delight in
tattooing their chests and arms with anchors,
and figures of different kinds. During the
whole of this painful operation, the boy will not
flinch, but laugh and joke with his admiring
companions, as if perfectly at ease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gambling of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>It would be difficult to find in the whole of this
numerous class, a youngster who is not&mdash;what
may be safely called&mdash;a desperate gambler. At
the age of fourteen this love of play first comes
upon the lad, and from that time until he is thirty
or so, not a Sunday passes but he is at his
stand on the gambling ground. Even if he has
no money to stake, he will loll away the morning
looking on, and so borrow excitement from
the successes of others. Every attempt made
by the police, to check this ruinous system, has
been unavailing, and has rather given a gloss
of daring courage to the sport, that tends to
render it doubly attractive.</p>

<p>If a costermonger has an hour to spare, his
first thought is to gamble away the time. He
does not care what he plays for, so long as he
can have a chance of winning something.
Whilst waiting for a market to open, his delight
is to find out some pieman and toss him for his
stock, though, by so doing, he risks his market-money
and only chance of living, to win that
which he will give away to the first friend he
meets. For the whole week the boy will work
untiringly, spurred on by the thought of the
money to be won on the Sunday. Nothing
will damp his ardour for gambling, the most
continued ill-fortune making him even more
reckless than if he were the luckiest man alive.</p>

<p>Many a lad who had gone down to the gambling
ground, with a good warm coat upon his
back and his pocket well filled from the Saturday
night’s market, will leave it at evening
penniless and coatless, having lost all his earnings,
stock-money, and the better part of his
clothing. Some of the boys, when desperate
with “bad luck,” borrow to the utmost limit of
their credit; then they mortgage their “king’s-man”
or neck-tie, and they will even change
their cord trousers, if better than those of the
winner, so as to have one more chance at the
turn of fortune. The coldest winter’s day will
not stop the Sunday’s gathering on the river-side,
for the heat of play warms them in spite
of the sharp wind blowing down the Thames.
If the weather be wet, so that the half-pence
stick to the ground, they find out some railway-arch
or else a beer-shop, and having filled the
tap-room with their numbers, they muffle the
table with handkerchiefs, and play secretly.
When the game is very exciting, they will even
forget their hunger, and continue to gamble
until it is too dark to see, before they think of
eating. One man told me, that when he was
working the races with lemonade, he had often
seen in the centre of a group, composed of costers,
thimble-riggers and showmen, as much as
100<i>l.</i> on the ground at one time, in gold and
silver. A friend of his, who had gone down in
company with him, with a pony-truck of toys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lost in less than an hour his earnings, truck,
stock of goods, and great-coat. Vowing to have
his revenge next time, he took his boy on his
back, and started off on the tramp to London,
there to borrow sufficient money to bring down
a fresh lot of goods on the morrow, and then
gamble away his earnings as before.</p>

<p>It is perfectly immaterial to the coster with
whom he plays, whether it be a lad from the
Lambeth potteries, or a thief from the Westminster
slums. Very often, too, the gamblers
of one costermonger district, will visit those of
another, and work what is called “a plant” in
this way. One of the visitors will go before
hand, and, joining a group of gamblers, commence
tossing. When sufficient time has
elapsed to remove all suspicion of companionship,
his mate will come up and commence betting
on each of his pals’ throws with those standing
round. By a curious quickness of hand, a
coster can make the toss tell favourably for his
wagering friend, who meets him after the play
is over in the evening, and shares the spoil.</p>

<p>The spots generally chosen for the Sunday’s
sport are in secret places, half-hidden from the
eye of the passers, where a scout can give quick
notice of the approach of the police: in the
fields about King’s-cross, or near any unfinished
railway buildings. The Mint, St. George’s-fields,
Blackfriars’-road, Bethnal-green, and Marylebone,
are all favourite resorts. Between Lambeth
and Chelsea, the shingle on the left side of
the Thames, is spotted with small rings of lads,
half-hidden behind the barges. One boy (of
the party) is always on the look out, and even
if a stranger should advance, the cry is given of
“Namous” or “Kool Eslop.” Instantly the
money is whipped-up and pocketed, and the
boys stand chattering and laughing together.
It is never difficult for a coster to find out
where the gambling parties are, for he has only
to stop the first lad he meets, and ask him
where the “erht pu” or “three up” is going
on, to discover their whereabouts.</p>

<p>If during the game a cry of “Police!” should
be given by the looker-out, instantly a rush at
the money is made by any one in the group, the
costers preferring that a stranger should have
the money rather than the policeman. There
is also a custom among them, that the ruined
player should be started again by a gift of 2<i>d.</i>
in every shilling lost, or, if the loss is heavy, a
present of four or five shillings is made; neither
is it considered at all dishonourable for the party
winning to leave with the full bloom of success
upon him.</p>

<p>That the description of one of these Sunday
scenes might be more truthful, a visit was paid
to a gambling-ring close to &mdash;&mdash;. Although not
twenty yards distant from the steam-boat pier,
yet the little party was so concealed among the
coal-barges, that not a head could be seen.
The spot chosen was close to a small narrow
court, leading from the street to the water-side,
and here the lad on the look-out was stationed.
There were about thirty young fellows, some
tall strapping youths, in the costers’ cable-cord
costume,&mdash;others, mere boys, in rags, from the
potteries, with their clothes stained with clay.
The party was hidden from the river by the
black dredger-boats on the beach; and it was so
arranged, that should the alarm be given, they
might leap into the coal-barges, and hide until
the intruder had retired. Seated on some oars
stretched across two craft, was a mortar-stained
bricklayer, keeping a look-out towards the river,
and acting as a sort of umpire in all disputes.
The two that were tossing had been playing
together since early morning; and it was easy
to tell which was the loser, by the anxious-looking
eye and compressed lip. He was quarrelsome
too; and if the crowd pressed upon him,
he would jerk his elbow back savagely, saying,
“I wish to C&mdash;&mdash;t you’d stand backer.” The
winner, a short man, in a mud-stained canvas
jacket, and a week’s yellow beard on his chin,
never spake a word beyond his “heads,” or
“tails;” but his cheeks were red, and the pipe
in his mouth was unlit, though he puffed at it.</p>

<p>In their hands they each held a long row of
halfpence, extending to the wrist, and topped by
shillings and half-crowns. Nearly every one
round had coppers in his hands, and bets were
made and taken as rapidly as they could be
spoken. “I lost a sov. last night in less than
no time,” said one man, who, with his hands in
his pockets, was looking on; “never mind&mdash;I
musn’t have no wenson this week, and try
again next Sunday.”</p>

<p>The boy who was losing was adopting every
means to “bring back his luck again.” Before
crying, he would toss up a halfpenny three
times, to see what he should call. At last,
with an oath, he pushed aside the boys round
him, and shifted his place, to see what that
would do; it had a good effect, for he won toss
after toss in a curiously fortunate way, and then
it was strange to watch his mouth gradually
relax and his brows unknit. His opponent was
a little startled, and passing his fingers through
his dusty hair, said, with a stupid laugh, “Well,
I never see the likes.” The betting also began
to shift. “Sixpence Ned wins!” cried three or
four; “Sixpence he loses!” answered another;
“Done!” and up went the halfpence. “Half-a-crown
Joe loses!”&mdash;“Here you are,” answered
Joe, but he lost again. “I’ll try you a ‘gen’”
(shilling) said a coster; “And a ‘rouf yenap’”
(fourpence), added the other. “Say a ‘exes’”
(sixpence).&mdash;“Done!” and the betting continued,
till the ground was spotted with silver
and halfpence.</p>

<p>“That’s ten bob he’s won in five minutes,”
said Joe (the loser), looking round with a forced
smile; but Ned (the winner) never spake a
word, even when he gave any change to his
antagonist; and if he took a bet, he only nodded
to the one that offered it, and threw down his
money. Once, when he picked up more than a
sovereign from the ground, that he had won in
one throw, a washed sweep, with a black rim
round his neck, said, “There’s a hog!” but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
there wasn’t even a smile at the joke. At last
Joe began to feel angry, and stamping his foot
till the water squirted up from the beach, cried,
“It’s no use; luck’s set in him&mdash;he’d muck a
thousand!” and so he shifted his ground, and
betted all round on the chance of better fortune
attending the movement. He lost again, and
some one bantering said, “You’ll win the shine-rag,
Joe,” meaning that he would be “cracked
up,” or ruined, if he continued.</p>

<p>When one o’clock struck, a lad left, saying,
he was “going to get an inside lining” (dinner).
The sweep asked him what he was going to
have. “A two-and-half plate, and a ha’p’orth
of smash” (a plate of soup and a ha’p’orth of
mashed potatoes), replied the lad, bounding into
the court. Nobody else seemed to care for his
dinner, for all stayed to watch the gamblers.</p>

<p>Every now and then some one would go up
the court to see if the lad watching for the
police was keeping a good look-out; but the
boy never deserted his post, for fear of losing
his threepence. If he had, such is the wish to
protect the players felt by every lad, that even
whilst at dinner, one of them, if he saw a policeman
pass, would spring up and rush to the
gambling ring to give notice.</p>

<p>When the tall youth, “Ned,” had won nearly
all the silver of the group, he suddenly jerked
his gains into his coat-pocket, and saying, “I’ve
done,” walked off, and was out of sight in an
instant. The surprise of the loser and all
around was extreme. They looked at the court
where he had disappeared, then at one another,
and at last burst out into one expression of
disgust. “There’s a scurf!” said one; “He’s
a regular scab,” cried another; and a coster
declared that he was “a trosseno, and no mistake.”
For although it is held to be fair for
the winner to go whenever he wishes, yet such
conduct is never relished by the losers.</p>

<p>It was then determined that “they would
have him to rights” the next time he came to
gamble; for every one would set at him, and
win his money, and then “turn up,” as he had
done.</p>

<p>The party was then broken up, the players
separating to wait for the new-comers that would
be sure to pour in after dinner.</p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Vic. Gallery.</span>”</h3>

<p>On a good attractive night, the rush of costers
to the threepenny gallery of the Coburg (better
known as “the Vic”) is peculiar and almost
awful.</p>

<p>The long zig-zag staircase that leads to the
pay box is crowded to suffocation at least an
hour before the theatre is opened; but, on the
occasion of a piece with a good murder in it,
the crowd will frequently collect as early as
three o’clock in the afternoon. Lads stand
upon the broad wooden bannisters about 50 feet
from the ground, and jump on each others’
backs, or adopt any expedient they can think of
to obtain a good place.</p>

<p>The walls of the well-staircase having a
remarkably fine echo, and the wooden floor of
the steps serving as a sounding board, the
shouting, whistling, and quarrelling of the
impatient young costers is increased tenfold.
If, as sometimes happens, a song with a chorus
is started, the ears positively ache with the din,
and when the chant has finished it seems as
though a sudden silence had fallen on the
people. To the centre of the road, and all round
the door, the mob is in a ferment of excitement,
and no sooner is the money-taker at his
post than the most frightful rush takes place,
every one heaving with his shoulder at the back
of the person immediately in front of him.
The girls shriek, men shout, and a nervous fear
is felt lest the massive staircase should fall in
with the weight of the throng, as it lately did
with the most terrible results. If a hat
tumbles from the top of the staircase, a hundred
hands snatch at it as it descends. When it is
caught a voice roars above the tumult, “All
right, Bill, I’ve got it”&mdash;for they all seem to
know one another&mdash;“Keep us a pitch and I’ll
bring it.”</p>

<p>To any one unaccustomed to be pressed flat
it would be impossible to enter with the mob.
To see the sight in the gallery it is better to
wait until the first piece is over. The ham-sandwich
men and pig-trotter women will give
you notice when the time is come, for with the
first clatter of the descending footsteps they
commence their cries.</p>

<p>There are few grown-up men that go to the
“Vic” gallery. The generality of the visitors
are lads from about twelve to three-and-twenty,
and though a few black-faced sweeps or whitey-brown
dustmen may be among the throng, the
gallery audience consists mainly of costermongers.
Young girls, too, are very plentiful, only
one-third of whom now take their babies, owing
to the new regulation of charging half-price for
infants. At the foot of the staircase stands a
group of boys begging for the return checks,
which they sell again for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 1<i>d.</i>, according
to the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>At each step up the well-staircase the warmth
and stench increase, until by the time one
reaches the gallery doorway, a furnace-heat
rushes out through the entrance that seems to
force you backwards, whilst the odour positively
prevents respiration. The mob on the landing,
standing on tiptoe and closely wedged together,
resists any civil attempt at gaining a glimpse of
the stage, and yet a coster lad will rush up,
elbow his way into the crowd, then jump up on
to the shoulders of those before him, and suddenly
disappear into the body of the gallery.</p>

<p>The gallery at “the Vic” is one of the
largest in London. It will hold from 1500 to
2000 people, and runs back to so great a
distance, that the end of it is lost in shadow,
excepting where the little gas-jets, against the
wall, light up the two or three faces around
them. When the gallery is well packed, it is
usual to see piles of boys on each others
shoulders at the back, while on the partition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boards, dividing off the slips, lads will pitch
themselves, despite the spikes.</p>

<p>As you look up the vast slanting mass of
heads from the upper boxes, each one appears
on the move. The huge black heap, dotted
with faces, and spotted with white shirt sleeves,
almost pains the eye to look at, and should a
clapping of hands commence, the twinkling
nearly blinds you. It is the fashion with the
mob to take off their coats; and the cross-braces
on the backs of some, and the bare shoulders
peeping out of the ragged shirts of others, are
the only variety to be found. The bonnets of
the “ladies” are hung over the iron railing in
front, their numbers nearly hiding the panels,
and one of the amusements of the lads in the
back seats consists in pitching orange peel or
nutshells into them, a good aim being rewarded
with a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>When the orchestra begins playing, before
“the gods” have settled into their seats, it is
impossible to hear a note of music. The
puffed-out cheeks of the trumpeters, and the
raised drumsticks tell you that the overture has
commenced, but no tune is to be heard. An
occasional burst of the full band being caught
by gushes, as if a high wind were raging.
Recognitions take place every moment, and
“Bill Smith” is called to in a loud voice from
one side, and a shout in answer from the other
asks “What’s up?” Or family secrets are
revealed, and “Bob Triller” is asked where
“Sal” is, and replies amid a roar of laughter,
that she is “a-larning the pynanney.”</p>

<p>By-and-by a youngster, who has come in late,
jumps up over the shoulders at the door, and
doubling himself into a ball, rolls down over
the heads in front, leaving a trail of commotion
for each one as he passes aims a blow at the
fellow. Presently a fight is sure to begin, and
then every one rises from his seat whistling and
shouting; three or four pairs of arms fall to,
the audience waving their hands till the moving
mass seems like microscopic eels in paste. But
the commotion ceases suddenly on the rising of
the curtain, and then the cries of “Silence!”
“Ord-a-a-r!” “Ord-a-a-r!” make more noise
than ever.</p>

<p>The “Vic” gallery is not to be moved by
touching sentiment. They prefer vigorous exercise
to any emotional speech. “The Child of the
Storm’s” declaration that she would share her
father’s “death or imprisonment as her duty,”
had no effect at all, compared with the split in
the hornpipe. The shrill whistling and brayvos
that followed the tar’s performance showed how
highly it was relished, and one “god” went so
far as to ask “how it was done.” The comic
actor kicking a dozen Polish peasants was
encored, but the grand banquet of the Czar
of all the Russias only produced merriment,
and a request that he would “give them a
bit” was made directly the Emperor took the
willow-patterned plate in his hand. All affecting
situations were sure to be interrupted by
cries of “orda-a-r;” and the lady begging
for her father’s life was told to “speak up
old gal;” though when the heroine of the
“dummestic dreamer” (as they call it) told
the general of all the Cossack forces “not to
be a fool,” the uproar of approbation grew
greater than ever,&mdash;and when the lady turned
up her swan’s-down cuffs, and seizing four
Russian soldiers shook them successively by
the collar, then the enthusiasm knew no bounds,
and the cries of “Bray-vo Vincent! Go it my
tulip!” resounded from every throat.</p>

<p>Altogether the gallery audience do not seem
to be of a gentle nature. One poor little lad
shouted out in a crying tone, “that he couldn’t
see,” and instantly a dozen voices demanded
“that he should be thrown over.”</p>

<p>Whilst the pieces are going on, brown, flat
bottles are frequently raised to the mouth, and
between the acts a man with a tin can, glittering
in the gas-light, goes round crying,
“Port-a-a-a-r! who’s for port-a-a-a-r.” As
the heat increased the faces grew bright red,
every bonnet was taken off, and ladies could
be seen wiping the perspiration from their
cheeks with the play-bills.</p>

<p>No delay between the pieces will be allowed,
and should the interval appear too long, some
one will shout out&mdash;referring to the curtain&mdash;“Pull
up that there winder blind!” or they
will call to the orchestra, saying, “Now then
you catgut-scrapers! Let’s have a ha’purth
of liveliness.” Neither will they suffer a play
to proceed until they have a good view of the
stage, and “Higher the blue,” is constantly
shouted, when the sky is too low, or “Light
up the moon,” when the transparency is rather
dim.</p>

<p>The dances and comic songs, between the
pieces, are liked better than anything else. A
highland fling is certain to be repeated, and a
stamping of feet will accompany the tune, and
a shrill whistling, keep time through the entire
performance.</p>

<p>But the grand hit of the evening is always
when a song is sung to which the entire gallery
can join in chorus. Then a deep silence prevails
all through the stanzas. Should any
burst in before his time, a shout of “orda-a-r”
is raised, and the intruder put down by a
thousand indignant cries. At the proper time,
however, the throats of the mob burst forth in
all their strength. The most deafening noise
breaks out suddenly, while the cat-calls keep
up the tune, and an imitation of a dozen Mr.
Punches squeak out the words. Some actors
at the minor theatres make a great point of
this, and in the bill upon the night of my visit,
under the title of “There’s a good time
coming, boys,” there was printed, “assisted
by the most numerous and effective chorus in
the metropolis&mdash;” meaning the whole of the
gallery. The singer himself started the mob,
saying, “Now then, the Exeter Hall touch if
you please gentlemen,” and beat time with
his hand, parodying M. Jullien with his <i>baton</i>.
An “angcore” on such occasions is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
demanded, and, despite a few murmurs of
“change it to ‘Duck-legged Dick,’” invariably
insisted on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Politics of Costermongers.&mdash;Policemen.</span></h3>

<p>The notion of the police is so intimately blended
with what may be called the politics of the
costermongers that I give them together.</p>

<p>The politics of these people are detailed in a
few words&mdash;they are nearly all Chartists. “You
might say, sir,” remarked one of my informants,
“that they <i>all</i> were Chartists, but as its better
you should rather be under than over the mark,
say <i>nearly</i> all.” Their ignorance, and their
being impulsive, makes them a dangerous class.
I am assured that in every district where the
costermongers are congregated, one or two of the
body, more intelligent than the others, have
great influence over them; and these leading
men are all Chartists, and being industrious and
not unprosperous persons, their pecuniary and
intellectual superiority cause them to be regarded
as oracles. One of these men said to
me: “The costers think that working-men know
best, and so they have confidence in us. I like
to make men discontented, and I will make them
discontented while the present system continues,
because it’s all for the middle and the moneyed
classes, and nothing, in the way of rights, for the
poor. People fancy when all’s quiet that all’s
stagnating. Propagandism is going on for all
that. It’s when all’s quiet that the seed’s a
growing. Republicans and Socialists are pressing
their doctrines.”</p>

<p>The costermongers have very vague notions
of an aristocracy; they call the more prosperous
of their own body “aristocrats.” Their notions
of an aristocracy of birth or wealth seem to be
formed on their opinion of the rich, or reputed
rich salesmen with whom they deal; and the
result is anything but favourable to the nobility.</p>

<p>Concerning free-trade, nothing, I am told,
can check the costermongers’ fervour for a cheap
loaf. A Chartist costermonger told me that he
knew numbers of costers who were keen Chartists
without understanding anything about the six
points.</p>

<p>The costermongers frequently attend political
meetings, going there in bodies of from six to
twelve. Some of them, I learned, could not
understand why Chartist leaders exhorted them
to peace and quietness, when they might as well
fight it out with the police at once. The costers
boast, moreover, that they stick more together
in any “row” than any other class. It is considered
by them a reflection on the character
of the thieves that they are seldom true to one
another.</p>

<p>It is a matter of marvel to many of this class
that people can live without working. The
ignorant costers have no knowledge of “property,”
or “income,” and conclude that the non-workers
all live out of the taxes. Of the taxes
generally they judge from their knowledge that
tobacco, which they account a necessary of life,
pays 3<i>s.</i> per lb. duty.</p>

<p>As regards the police, the hatred of a costermonger
to a “peeler” is intense, and with their
opinion of the police, all the more ignorant unite
that of the governing power. “Can you wonder
at it, sir,” said a costermonger to me, “that I
hate the police? They drive us about, we must
move on, we can’t stand here, and we can’t pitch
there. But if we’re cracked up, that is if we’re
forced to go into the Union (I’ve known it both at
Clerkenwell and the City of London workhouses,)
why the parish gives us money to buy a barrow,
or a shallow, or to hire them, and leave the
house and start for ourselves: and what’s the
use of that, if the police won’t let us sell our
goods?&mdash;Which is right, the parish or the
police?”</p>

<p>To thwart the police in any measure the
costermongers readily aid one another. One
very common procedure, if the policeman has
seized a barrow, is to whip off a wheel, while the
officers have gone for assistance; for a large and
loaded barrow requires two men to convey it to
the green-yard. This is done with great dexterity;
and the next step is to dispose of the stock
to any passing costers, or to any “standing” in
the neighbourhood, and it is honestly accounted
for. The policemen, on their return, find an
empty, and unwheelable barrow, which they must
carry off by main strength, amid the jeers of the
populace.</p>

<p>I am assured that in case of a political riot
every “coster” would seize his policeman.</p>

Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>Only one-tenth&mdash;at the outside one-tenth&mdash;of
the couples living together and carrying on the
costermongering trade, are married. In Clerkenwell
parish, however, where the number of
married couples is about a fifth of the whole,
this difference is easily accounted for, as in
Advent and Easter the incumbent of that parish
marries poor couples without a fee. Of the rights
of “legitimate” or “illegitimate” children the
costermongers understand nothing, and account
it a mere waste of money and time to go through
the ceremony of wedlock when a pair can live
together, and be quite as well regarded by their
fellows, without it. The married women associate
with the unmarried mothers of families without
the slightest scruple. There is no honour
attached to the marriage state, and no shame to
concubinage. Neither are the unmarried women
less faithful to their “partners” than the married;
but I understand that, of the two classes,
the unmarried betray the most jealousy.</p>

<p>As regards the fidelity of these women I was
assured that, “in anything like good times,”
they were rigidly faithful to their husbands or
paramours; but that, in the worst pinch of
poverty, a departure from this fidelity&mdash;if it provided
a few meals or a fire&mdash;was not considered
at all heinous. An old costermonger, who had
been mixed up with other callings, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
prejudices were certainly not in favour of his
present trade, said to me, “What I call the working
girls, sir, are as industrious and as faithful
a set as can well be. I’m satisfied that they’re
more faithful to their mates than other poor
working women. I never knew one of these working
girls do wrong that way. They’re strong,
hearty, healthy girls, and keep clean rooms.
Why, there’s numbers of men leave their stock-money
with their women, just taking out two or
three shillings to gamble with and get drunk
upon. They sometimes take a little drop themselves,
the women do, and get beaten by their
husbands for it, and hardest beaten if the man’s
drunk himself. They’re sometimes beaten for
other things too, or for nothing at all. But they
seem to like the men better for their beating
them. I never could make that out.” Notwithstanding
this fidelity, it appears that the
“larking and joking” of the young, and sometimes
of the middle-aged people, among themselves,
is anything but delicate. The unmarried
separate as seldom as the married. The fidelity
characterizing the women does not belong to
the men.</p>

<p>The dancing-rooms are the places where
matches are made up. There the boys go to
look out for “mates,” and sometimes a match is
struck up the first night of meeting, and the
couple live together forthwith. The girls at
these dances are all the daughters of costermongers,
or of persons pursuing some other
course of street life. Unions take place when
the lad is but 14. Two or three out of 100 have
their female helpmates at that early age; but
the female is generally a couple of years older
than her partner. Nearly all the costermongers
form such alliances as I have described, when
both parties are under twenty. One reason why
these alliances are contracted at early ages is,
that when a boy has assisted his father, or any
one engaging him, in the business of a costermonger,
he knows that he can borrow money,
and hire a shallow or a barrow&mdash;or he may have
saved 5<i>s.</i>&mdash;“and then if the father vexes him or
snubs him,” said one of my informants, “he’ll
tell his father to go to h&mdash;l, and he and his gal
will start on their own account.”</p>

<p>Most of the costermongers have numerous
families, but not those who contract alliances
very young. The women continue working down
to the day of their confinement.</p>

<p>“Chance children,” as they are called, or
children unrecognised by any father, are rare
among the young women of the costermongers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Religion of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>An intelligent and trustworthy man, until very
recently actively engaged in costermongering,
computed that not 3 in 100 costermongers had
ever been in the interior of a church, or any
place of worship, or knew what was meant by
Christianity. The same person gave me the following
account, which was confirmed by others:</p>

<p>“The costers have no religion at all, and very
little notion, or none at all, of what religion or
a future state is. Of all things they hate tracts.
They hate them because the people leaving them
never give them anything, and as they can’t read
the tract&mdash;not one in forty&mdash;they’re vexed to be
bothered with it. And really what is the use of
giving people reading before you’ve taught them
to read? Now, they respect the City Missionaries,
because they read to them&mdash;and the
costers will listen to reading when they don’t
understand it&mdash;and because they visit the sick,
and sometimes give oranges and such like to
them and the children. I’ve known a City
Missionary buy a shilling’s worth of oranges
of a coster, and give them away to the sick
and the children&mdash;most of them belonging to
the costermongers&mdash;down the court, and that
made him respected there. I think the City
Missionaries have done good. But I’m satisfied
that if the costers had to profess themselves
of some religion to-morrow, they would all
become Roman Catholics, every one of them.
This is the reason:&mdash;London costers live very
often in the same courts and streets as the poor
Irish, and if the Irish are sick, be sure there
comes to them the priest, the Sisters of Charity&mdash;they
<i>are</i> good women&mdash;and some other
ladies. Many a man that’s not a Catholic,
has rotted and died without any good person
near him. Why, I lived a good while in
Lambeth, and there wasn’t one coster in 100,
I’m satisfied, knew so much as the rector’s
name,&mdash;though Mr. Dalton’s a very good man.
But the reason I was telling you of, sir, is that
the costers reckon <i>that</i> religion’s the best that
gives the most in charity, and they think the
Catholics do this. I’m not a Catholic myself, but
I believe every word of the Bible, and have the
greater belief that it’s the word of God because
it teaches democracy. The Irish in the courts
get sadly chaffed by the others about their
priests,&mdash;but they’ll die for the priest. Religion
is a regular puzzle to the costers. They see
people come out of church and chapel, and as
they’re mostly well dressed, and there’s very few
of their own sort among the church-goers, the
costers somehow mix up being religious with
being respectable, and so they have a queer sort
of feeling about it. It’s a mystery to them. It’s
shocking when you come to think of it. They’ll
listen to any preacher that goes among them;
and then a few will say&mdash;I’ve heard it often&mdash;‘A
b&mdash;y fool, why don’t he let people go to
h-ll their own way?’ There’s another thing
that makes the costers think so well of the
Catholics. If a Catholic coster&mdash;there’s only
very few of them&mdash;is ‘cracked up’ (penniless),
he’s often started again, and the others have
a notion that it’s through some chapel-fund.
I don’t know whether it is so or not, but I know
the cracked-up men are started again, if they’re
Catholics. It’s still the stranger that the regular
costermongers, who are nearly all Londoners,
should have such respect for the Roman
Catholics, when they have such a hatred of the
Irish, whom they look upon as intruders and
underminers.”&mdash;“If a missionary came among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
us with plenty of money,” said another costermonger,
“he might make us all Christians or
Turks, or anything he liked.” Neither the
Latter-day Saints, nor any similar sect, have
made converts among the costermongers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Uneducated State of
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I have stated elsewhere, that only about one in
ten of the regular costermongers is able to read.
The want of education among both men and
women is deplorable, and I tested it in several
instances. The following statement, however,
from one of the body, is no more to be taken as
representing the ignorance of the class generally,
than are the clear and discriminating
accounts I received from intelligent costermongers
to be taken as representing the intelligence
of the body.</p>

<p>The man with whom I conversed, and from
whom I received the following statement, seemed
about thirty. He was certainly not ill-looking,
but with a heavy cast of countenance, his light
blue eyes having little expression. His statements,
or opinions, I need hardly explain, were
given both spontaneously in the course of conversation,
and in answer to my questions. I
give them almost verbatim, omitting oaths and
slang:</p>

<p>“Well, times is bad, sir,” he said, “but it’s
a deadish time. I don’t do so well at present
as in middlish times, I think. When I served
the Prince of Naples, not far from here (I
presume that he alluded to the Prince of
Capua), I did better and times was better.
That was five years ago, but I can’t say to
a year or two. He was a good customer, and
was very fond of peaches. I used to sell them
to him, at 12<i>s.</i> the plasket when they was
new. The plasket held a dozen, and cost me
6<i>s.</i> at Covent-garden&mdash;more sometimes; but I
didn’t charge him more when they did. His
footman was a black man, and a ignorant man
quite, and his housekeeper was a Englishwoman.
He was the Prince o’ Naples, was my
customer; but I don’t know what he was like, for
I never saw him. I’ve heard that he was the
brother of the king of Naples. I can’t say
where Naples is, but if you was to ask at
Euston-square, they’ll tell you the fare there and
the time to go it in. It may be in France for
anything I know may Naples, or in Ireland.
Why don’t you ask at the square? I went
to Croydon once by rail, and slept all the
way without stirring, and so you may to
Naples for anything I know. I never heard
of the Pope being a neighbour of the King of
Naples. Do you mean living next door to
him? But I don’t know nothing of the King
of Naples, only the prince. I don’t know what
the Pope is. Is he any trade? It’s nothing
to me, when he’s no customer of mine. I have
nothing to say about nobody that ain’t no
customers. My crabs is caught in the sea, in
course. I gets them at Billingsgate. I never
saw the sea, but it’s salt-water, I know. I
can’t say whereabouts it lays. I believe it’s
in the hands of the Billingsgate salesmen&mdash;all of
it? I’ve heard of shipwrecks at sea, caused
by drownding, in course. I never heard that
the Prince of Naples was ever at sea. I like
to talk about him, he was such a customer when
he lived near here.” (Here he repeated his
account of the supply of peaches to his Royal
Highness.) “I never was in France, no, sir,
never. I don’t know the way. Do you think
I could do better there? I never was in
the Republic there. What’s it like? Bonaparte?
O, yes; I’ve heard of him. He was
at Waterloo. I didn’t know he’d been alive
now and in France, as you ask me about him.
I don’t think you’re larking, sir. Did I hear
of the French taking possession of Naples,
and Bonaparte making his brother-in-law
king? Well, I didn’t, but it may be true,
because I served the Prince of Naples, what
<i>was</i> the brother of the king. I never heard
whether the Prince was the king’s older brother
or his younger. I wish he may turn out his
older if there’s property coming to him, as the
oldest has the first turn; at least so I’ve heard&mdash;first
come, first served. I’ve worked the streets
and the courts at all times. I’ve worked them by
moonlight, but you couldn’t see the moonlight
where it was busy. I can’t say how far the
moon’s off us. It’s nothing to me, but I’ve
seen it a good bit higher than St. Paul’s. I
don’t know nothing about the sun. Why do
you ask? It must be nearer than the moon
for it’s warmer,&mdash;and if they’re both fire, that
shows it. It’s like the tap-room grate and that
bit of a gas-light; to compare the two is.
What was St. Paul’s that the moon was above?
A church, sir; so I’ve heard. I never was in
a church. O, yes, I’ve heard of God; he
made heaven and earth; I never heard of his
making the sea; that’s another thing, and you
can best learn about that at Billingsgate. (He
seemed to think that the sea was an appurtenance
of Billingsgate.) Jesus Christ? Yes.
I’ve heard of him. Our Redeemer? Well,
I only wish I could redeem my Sunday togs
from my uncle’s.”</p>

<p>Another costermonger, in answer to inquiries,
said: “I ’spose you think us ’riginal coves that
you ask. We’re not like Methusalem, or some
such swell’s name, (I presume that Malthus was
meant) as wanted to murder children afore
they was born, as I once heerd lectured
about&mdash;we’re nothing like that.”</p>

<p>Another on being questioned, and on being
told that the information was wanted for the
press, replied: “The press? I’ll have nothing
to say to it. We are oppressed enough already.”</p>

<p>That a class numbering 30,000 should be permitted
to remain in a state of almost brutish
ignorance is a national disgrace. If the London
costers belong especially to the “dangerous
classes,” the danger of such a body is assuredly
an evil of our own creation; for the gratitude of
the poor creatures to any one who seeks to give
them the least knowledge is almost pathetic.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Language of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The slang language of the costermongers is not
very remarkable for originality of construction;
it possesses no humour: but they boast that it
is known only to themselves; it is far beyond the
Irish, they say, and puzzles the Jews. The <i>root</i>
of the costermonger tongue, so to speak, is to give
the words spelt backward, or rather pronounced
rudely backward,&mdash;for in my present chapter the
language has, I believe, been reduced to orthography
for the first time. With this backward
pronunciation, which is very arbitrary, are mixed
words reducible to no rule and seldom referrable
to any origin, thus complicating the mystery
of this unwritten tongue; while any syllable is
added to a proper slang word, at the discretion
of the speaker.</p>

<p>Slang is acquired very rapidly, and some costermongers
will converse in it by the hour. The
women use it sparingly; the girls more than
the women; the men more than the girls; and
the boys most of all. The most ignorant of all
these classes deal most in slang and boast of
their cleverness and proficiency in it. In their
conversations among themselves, the following
are invariably the terms used in money
matters. A rude back-spelling may generally
be traced:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>Flatch</i></td><td>Halfpenny.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Yenep</i></td><td>Penny.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Owt-yenep</i></td><td>Twopence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Erth-yenep</i></td><td>Threepence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Rouf-yenep</i></td><td>Fourpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Ewif-yenep</i></td><td>Fivepence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Exis-yenep</i></td><td>Sixpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Neves-yenep</i></td><td>Sevenpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Teaich-yenep</i></td><td>Eightpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Enine-yenep</i></td><td>Ninepence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Net-yenep</i></td><td>Tenpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Leven</i></td><td>Elevenpence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Gen</i></td><td>Twelvepence.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Yenep-flatch</i></td><td>Three half-pence.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>and so on through the penny-halfpennies.</p>

<p>It was explained to me by a costermonger,
who had introduced some new words into the
slang, that “leven” was allowed so closely to
resemble the proper word, because elevenpence
was almost an unknown sum to costermongers,
the transition&mdash;weights and measures notwithstanding&mdash;being
immediate from 10<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Gen” is a shilling and the numismatic
sequence is pursued with the gens, as regards
shillings, as with the “yeneps” as regards
pence. The blending of the two is also according
to the same system as “Owt-gen, teaich-yenep”
two-and-eightpence. The exception to
the uniformity of the “gen” enumeration is
in the sum of 8<i>s.</i>, which instead of “teaich-gen”
is “teaich-guy:” a deviation with ample
precedents in all civilised tongues.</p>

<p>As regards the larger coins the translation
into slang is not reducible into rule. The following
are the costermonger coins of the higher
value:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>Couter</i></td><td>Sovereign.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Half-Couter</i>, or <i>Net-gen</i></td><td>Half-sovereign.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Ewif-gen</i></td><td>Crown.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Flatch-ynork</i></td><td>Half-crown.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The costermongers still further complicate
their slang by a mode of multiplication. They
thus say, “Erth Ewif-gens” or 3 times 5<i>s.</i>, which
means of course 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Speaking of this language, a costermonger said
to me: “The Irish can’t tumble to it anyhow;
the Jews can tumble better, but we’re <i>their</i>
masters. Some of the young salesmen at Billingsgate
understand us,&mdash;but only at Billingsgate;
and they think they’re uncommon clever,
but they’re not quite up to the mark. The police
don’t understand us at all. It would be a pity
if they did.”</p>

<p>I give a few more phrases:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>A doogheno or dabheno?</i></td><td>Is it a good or bad market?</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>A regular trosseno</i></td><td>A regular bad one.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>On</i></td><td>No.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Say</i></td><td>Yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Tumble to your barrikin</i></td><td>Understand you.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Top o’ reeb</i></td><td>Pot of beer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Doing dab</i></td><td>Doing badly.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Cool him</i></td><td>Look at him.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The latter phrase is used when one costermonger
warns another of the approach of a
policeman “who might order him to move on,
or be otherwise unpleasant.” “Cool” (look)
is exclaimed, or “Cool him” (look at him).
One costermonger told me as a great joke that a
very stout policeman, who was then new to the
duty, was when in a violent state of perspiration,
much offended by a costermonger saying “Cool
him.”</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><i>Cool the esclop</i></td><td>Look at the police.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Cool the namesclop</i></td><td>Look at the policeman.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Cool ta the dillo nemo</i></td><td>Look at the old woman;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>said of any woman, young or old, who,
according to costermonger notions, is “giving
herself airs.”</p>

<p>This language seems confined, in its general
use, to the immediate objects of the costermonger’s
care; but is, among the more acute
members of the fraternity, greatly extended,
and is capable of indefinite extension.</p>

<p>The costermongers oaths, I may conclude,
are all in the vernacular; nor are any of the
common salutes, such as “How d’you do?” or
“Good-night” known to their slang.</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Many costermongers, “but principally&mdash;perhaps
entirely,”&mdash;I was told, “those who had
not been regular born and bred to the trade, but
had taken to it when cracked up in their own,”
do not trouble themselves to acquire any knowledge
of slang. It is not indispensable for the
carrying on of their business; the grand object,
however, seems to be, to shield their bargainings
at market, or their conversation among themselves
touching their day’s work and profits,
from the knowledge of any Irish or uninitiated
fellow-traders.</p>

<p>The simple principle of costermonger slang&mdash;that
of pronouncing backward, may cause its
acquirement to be regarded by the educated as a
matter of ease. But it is a curious fact that
lads who become costermongers’ boys, without
previous association with the class, acquire a
very ready command of the language, and this
though they are not only unable to spell, but
don’t “know a letter in a book.” I saw one lad,
whose parents had, until five or six months back,
resided in the country. The lad himself was
fourteen; he told me he had not been “a costermongering”
more than three months, and
prided himself on his mastery over slang. To
test his ability, I asked him the coster’s word
for “hippopotamus;” he answered, with tolerable
readiness, “musatoppop.” I then asked
him for the like rendering of “equestrian” (one
of Astley’s bills having caught my eye). He
replied, but not quite so readily, “nirtseque.”
The last test to which I subjected him was
“good-naturedly;” and though I induced him
to repeat the word twice, I could not, on any of
the three renderings, distinguish any precise
sound beyond an indistinct gabbling, concluded
emphatically with “doog:”&mdash;“good” being a
word with which all these traders are familiar.
It must be remembered, that the words I demanded
were remote from the young costermonger’s
vocabulary, if not from his understanding.</p>

<p>Before I left this boy, he poured forth a
minute or more’s gibberish, of which, from its
rapid utterance, I could distinguish nothing;
but I found from his after explanation, that it
was a request to me to make a further purchase
of his walnuts.</p>

<p>This slang is utterly devoid of any applicability
to humour. It gives no new fact, or
approach to a fact, for philologists. One superior
genius among the costers, who has invented
words for them, told me that he had no system
for coining his term. He gave to the known
words some terminating syllable, or, as he called
it, “a new turn, just,” to use his own words,
“as if he chorussed them, with a tol-de-rol.”
The intelligence communicated in this slang is,
in a great measure, communicated, as in other
slang, as much by the inflection of the voice,
the emphasis, the tone, the look, the shrug, the
nod, the wink, as by the words spoken.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Nicknames of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>Like many rude, and almost all wandering
communities, the costermongers, like the
cabmen and pickpockets, are hardly ever known
by their real names; even the honest men among
them are distinguished by some strange appellation.
Indeed, they are all known one to
another by nicknames, which they acquire either
by some mode of dress, some remark that has
ensured costermonger applause, some peculiarity
in trading, or some defect or singularity in
personal appearance. Men are known as “Rotten
Herrings,” “Spuddy” (a seller of bad potatoes,
until beaten by the Irish for his bad wares,)
“Curly” (a man with a curly head), “Foreigner”
(a man who had been in the Spanish-Legion),
“Brassy” (a very saucy person), “Gaffy” (once
a performer), “The One-eyed Buffer,” “Jaw-breaker,”
“Pine-apple Jack,” “Cast-iron Poll”
(her head having been struck with a pot without
injury to her), “Whilky,” “Blackwall Poll”
(a woman generally having two black eyes),
“Lushy Bet,” “Dirty Sall” (the costermongers
generally objecting to dirty women), and “Dancing
Sue.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Education of Costermongers’
Children.</span></h3>

<p>I have used the heading of “Education,” but
perhaps to say “non-education,” would be more
suitable. Very few indeed of the costermongers’
children are sent even to the Ragged Schools;
and if they are, from all I could learn, it is
done more that the mother may be saved the
trouble of tending them at home, than from
any desire that the children shall acquire useful
knowledge. Both boys and girls are sent out
by their parents in the evening to sell nuts,
oranges, &amp;c., at the doors of the theatres, or in
any public place, or “round the houses” (a
stated circuit from their place of abode). This
trade they pursue eagerly for the sake of “bunts,”
though some carry home the money they take,
very honestly. The costermongers are kind to
their children, “perhaps in a rough way, and the
women make regular pets of them very often.”
One experienced man told me, that he had seen
a poor costermonger’s wife&mdash;one of the few who
could read&mdash;instructing her children in reading;
but such instances were very rare. The education
of these children is such only as the streets
afford; and the streets teach them, for the most
part&mdash;and in greater or lesser degrees,&mdash;acuteness&mdash;a
precocious acuteness&mdash;in all that concerns
their immediate wants, business, or gratifications;
a patient endurance of cold and hunger;
a desire to obtain money without working for it;
a craving for the excitement of gambling; an
inordinate love of amusement; and an irrepressible
repugnance to any settled in-door industry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Literature of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>We have now had an inkling of the London
costermonger’s notions upon politics and religion.
We have seen the brutified state in which he is
allowed by society to remain, though possessing
the same faculties and susceptibilities as ourselves&mdash;the
same power to perceive and admire
the forms of truth, beauty, and goodness, as even
the very highest in the state. We have witnessed
how, instinct with all the elements of manhood
and beasthood, the qualities of the beast are principally
developed in him, while those of the man
are stunted in their growth. It now remains for
us to look into some other matters concerning
this curious class of people, and, first, of their
literature:</p>

<p>It may appear anomalous to speak of the literature
of an uneducated body, but even the
costermongers have their tastes for books. They
are very fond of hearing any one read aloud to
them, and listen very attentively. One man
often reads the Sunday paper of the beer-shop to
them, and on a fine summer’s evening a costermonger,
or any neighbour who has the advantage
of being “a schollard,” reads aloud to them in
the courts they inhabit. What they love best to
listen to&mdash;and, indeed, what they are most eager
for&mdash;are Reynolds’s periodicals, especially the
“Mysteries of the Court.” “They’ve got tired
of Lloyd’s blood-stained stories,” said one man,
who was in the habit of reading to them, “and
I’m satisfied that, of all London, Reynolds is the
most popular man among them. They stuck
to him in Trafalgar-square, and would again.
They all say he’s ‘a trump,’ and Feargus
O’Connor’s another trump with them.”</p>

<p>One intelligent man considered that the spirit
of curiosity manifested by costermongers, as
regards the information or excitement derived
from hearing stories read, augured well for the
improvability of the class.</p>

<p>Another intelligent costermonger, who had
recently read some of the cheap periodicals to
ten or twelve men, women, and boys, all costermongers,
gave me an account of the comments
made by his auditors. They had assembled,
after their day’s work or their rounds, for the
purpose of hearing my informant read the last
number of some of the penny publications.</p>

<p>“The costermongers,” said my informant,
“are very fond of illustrations. I have known
a man, what couldn’t read, buy a periodical what
had an illustration, a little out of the common
way perhaps, just that he might learn from some
one, who <i>could</i> read, what it was all about. They
have all heard of Cruikshank, and they think
everything funny is by him&mdash;funny scenes in a
play and all. His ‘Bottle’ was very much admired.
I heard one man say it was very prime,
and showed what ‘lush’ did, but I saw the same
man,” added my informant, “drunk three hours
afterwards. Look you here, sir,” he continued,
turning over a periodical, for he had the number
with him, “here’s a portrait of ‘Catherine of
Russia.’ ‘Tell us all about her,’ said one man to
me last night; ‘read it; what was she?’ When I
had read it,” my informant continued, “another
man, to whom I showed it, said, ‘Don’t the cove
as did that know a deal?’ for they fancy&mdash;at least,
a many do&mdash;that one man writes a whole periodical,
or a whole newspaper. Now here,” proceeded
my friend, “you see’s an engraving of a
man hung up, burning over a fire, and some
costers would go mad if they couldn’t learn what
he’d been doing, who he was, and all about him.
‘But about the picture?’ they would say, and
this is a very common question put by them
whenever they see an engraving.</p>

<p>“Here’s one of the passages that took their
fancy wonderfully,” my informant observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘With glowing cheeks, flashing eyes, and palpitating
bosom, Venetia Trelawney rushed back into the refreshment-room,
where she threw herself into one of the
arm-chairs already noticed. But scarcely had she thus
sunk down upon the flocculent cushion, when a sharp
click, as of some mechanism giving way, met her ears;
and at the same instant her wrists were caught in
manacles which sprang out of the arms of the treacherous
chair, while two steel bands started from the richly-carved
back and grasped her shoulders. A shriek
burst from her lips&mdash;she struggled violently, but all to
no purpose: for she was a captive&mdash;and powerless!</p>

<p>‘We should observe that the manacles and the steel
bands which had thus fastened upon her, were covered
with velvet, so that they inflicted no positive injury
upon her, nor even produced the slightest abrasion of
her fair and polished skin.’</p></div>

<p>Here all my audience,” said the man to me,
“broke out with&mdash;‘Aye! that’s the way the
harristocrats hooks it. There’s nothing o’ that
sort among us; the rich has all that barrikin to
themselves.’ ‘Yes, that’s the b&mdash;&mdash; way the
taxes goes in,’ shouted a woman.</p>

<p>“Anything about the police sets them a talking
at once. This did when I read it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The Ebenezers still continued their fierce struggle,
and, from the noise they made, seemed as if they were
tearing each other to pieces, to the wild roar of a chorus
of profane swearing. The alarm, as Bloomfield had
predicted, was soon raised, and some two or three
policemen, with their bull’s-eyes, and still more effective
truncheons, speedily restored order.’</p></div>

<p>‘The blessed crushers is everywhere,’ shouted
one. ‘I wish I’d been there to have had a shy
at the eslops,’ said another. And then a man
sung out: ‘O, don’t I like the Bobbys?’</p>

<p>“If there’s any foreign language which can’t
be explained, I’ve seen the costers,” my informant
went on, “annoyed at it&mdash;quite annoyed.
Another time I read part of one of Lloyd’s
numbers to them&mdash;but they like something
spicier. One article in them&mdash;here it is&mdash;finishes
in this way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The social habits and costumes of the Magyar
<i>noblesse</i> have almost all the characteristics of the corresponding
class in Ireland. This word <i>noblesse</i> is one
of wide signification in Hungary; and one may with
great truth say of this strange nation, that ‘<i>qui n’est
point noble n’est rien</i>.’”</p></div>

<p>‘I can’t tumble to that barrikin,’ said a young
fellow; ‘it’s a jaw-breaker. But if this here&mdash;what
d’ye call it, you talk about&mdash;was like the
Irish, why they was a rum lot.’ ‘Noblesse,’ said
a man that’s considered a clever fellow, from
having once learned his letters, though he can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
read or write. ‘Noblesse! Blessed if I know
what he’s up to.’ Here there was a regular
laugh.”</p>

<p>From other quarters I learned that some of
the costermongers who were able to read, or
loved to listen to reading, purchased their literature
in a very commercial spirit, frequently
buying the periodical which is the largest in
size, because when “they’ve got the reading out
of it,” as they say, “it’s worth a halfpenny for
the barrow.”</p>

<p>Tracts they will rarely listen to, but if any
persevering man <i>will</i> read tracts, and state that
he does it for their benefit and improvement,
they listen without rudeness, though often with
evident unwillingness. “Sermons or tracts,” said
one of their body to me, “gives them the ’orrors.”
Costermongers purchase, and not unfrequently,
the first number of a penny periodical, “to see
what it’s like.”</p>

<p>The tales of robbery and bloodshed, of heroic,
eloquent, and gentlemanly highwaymen, or of
gipsies turning out to be nobles, now interest the
costermongers but little, although they found
great delight in such stories a few years back.
Works relating to Courts, potentates, or “harristocrats,”
are the most relished by these rude
people.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Honesty of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I heard on all hands that the costers never steal
from one another, and never wink at any one
stealing from a neighbouring stall. Any stall-keeper
will leave his stall untended to get his
dinner, his neighbour acting for him; sometimes
he will leave it to enjoy a game at skittles. It
was computed for me, that property worth 10,000<i>l.</i>
belonging to costers is daily left exposed in the
streets or at the markets, almost entirely unwatched,
the policeman or market-keeper only
passing at intervals. And yet thefts are rarely
heard of, and when heard of are not attributable
to costermongers, but to regular thieves. The
way in which the sum of 10,000<i>l.</i> was arrived at,
is this: “In Hooper-street, Lambeth,” said my
informant, “there are thirty barrows and carts
exposed on an evening, left in the street, with
nobody to see to them; left there all night.
That is only one street. Each barrow and board
would be worth, on the average, 2<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>, and that
would be 67<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> In the other bye-streets and
courts off the New-cut are six times as many,
Hooper-street having the most. This would give
405<i>l.</i> in all, left unwatched of a night. There
are, throughout London, twelve more districts besides
the New-cut&mdash;at least twelve districts&mdash;and,
calculating the same amount in these, we have,
altogether, 4,860<i>l.</i> worth of barrows. Taking in
other bye-streets, we may safely reckon it at
4,000 barrows; for the numbers I have given in
the thirteen places are 2,520, and 1,480 added is
moderate. At least half of those which are in
use next day, are left unwatched; more, I have
no doubt, but say half. The stock of these 2,000
will average 10<i>s.</i> each, or 1,000<i>l.</i>; and the barrows
will be worth 4,500<i>l.</i>; in all 5,500<i>l.</i>, and
the property exposed on the stalls and the markets
will be double in amount, or 11,000<i>l.</i> in value,
every day, but say 10,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>“Besides, sir,” I was told, “the thieves
won’t rob the costers so often as they will the
shopkeepers. It’s easier to steal from a butcher’s
or bacon-seller’s open window than from a costermonger’s
stall or barrow, because the shopkeeper’s
eye can’t be always on his goods. But
there’s always some one to give an eye to a coster’s
property. At Billingsgate the thieves will
rob the salesmen far readier than they will us.
They know we’d take it out of them readier if
they were caught. It’s Lynch law with us. We
never give them in charge.”</p>

<p>The costermongers’ boys will, I am informed,
cheat their employers, but they do not steal from
them. The costers’ donkey stables have seldom
either lock or latch, and sometimes oysters, and
other things which the donkey will not molest,
are left there, but are never stolen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Conveyances of the Costermongers
and other Street-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>We now come to consider the matters relating
more particularly to the commercial life of the
costermonger.</p>

<p>All who pass along the thoroughfares of the
Metropolis, bestowing more than a cursory
glance upon the many phases of its busy street
life, must be struck with astonishment to observe
the various modes of conveyance, used by those
who resort to the public thoroughfares for a livelihood.
From the more provident costermonger’s
pony and donkey cart, to the old rusty iron tray
slung round the neck by the vendor of blacking,
and down to the little grey-eyed Irish boy
with his lucifer-matches, in the last remains of
a willow hand-basket&mdash;the shape and variety of
the means resorted to by the costermongers and
other street-sellers, for carrying about their
goods, are almost as manifold as the articles
they vend.</p>

<p>The pony&mdash;or donkey&mdash;carts (and the latter
is by far the more usual beast of draught),
of the prosperous costermongers are of three
kinds:&mdash;the first is of an oblong shape, with a
rail behind, upon which is placed a tray filled with
bunches of greens, turnips, celery, &amp;c., whilst
other commodities are laid in the bed of the cart.
Another kind is the common square cart without
springs, which is so constructed that the
sides, as well as the front and back, will let
down and form shelves whereon the stock may
be arranged to advantage. The third sort of
pony-cart is one of home manufacture, consisting
of the framework of a body without
sides, or front, or hind part. Sometimes a coster’s
barrow is formed into a donkey cart merely
by fastening, with cord, two rough poles to the
handles. All these several kinds of carts are
used for the conveyance of either fruit, vegetables,
or fish; but besides those, there is the
salt and mustard vendor’s cart, with and without
the tilt or covering, and a square piece of
tin (stuck into a block of salt), on which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
painted “salt 3 lbs. a penny,” and “mustard
a penny an ounce.” Then there is the poultry
cart, with the wild-ducks, and rabbits dangling
at its sides, and with two uprights and a cross-stick,
upon which are suspended birds, &amp;c.,
slung across in couples.</p>

<p>The above conveyances are all of small
dimensions, the barrows being generally about
five feet long and three wide, while the carts
are mostly about four feet square.</p>

<p>Every kind of harness is used; some is well
blacked and greased and glittering with brass,
others are almost as grey with dust as the donkey
itself. Some of the jackasses are gaudily caparisoned
in an old carriage-harness, which fits it
like a man’s coat on a boy’s back, while the
plated silver ornaments are pink, with the copper
showing through; others have rope traces
and belly-bands, and not a few indulge in old
cotton handkerchiefs for pads.</p>

<p>The next conveyance (which, indeed, is the
most general) is the costermonger’s hand-barrow.
These are very light in their make,
with springs terminating at the axle. Some
have rails behind for the arrangement of their
goods; others have not. Some have side rails,
whilst others have only the frame-work. The
shape of these barrows is oblong, and sloped
from the hind-part towards the front; the bottom
of the bed is not boarded, but consists of
narrow strips of wood nailed athwart and across.
When the coster is hawking his fish, or vending
his green stuff, he provides himself with a
wooden tray, which is placed upon his barrow.
Those who cannot afford a tray get some pieces
of board and fasten them together, these answering
their purpose as well. Pine-apple and
pine-apple rock barrows are not unfrequently
seen with small bright coloured flags at the
four corners, fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>The knife-cleaner’s barrow, which has lately
appeared in the streets, must not be passed
over here. It consists of a huge sentry-box, with
a door, and is fixed upon two small wheels, being
propelled in the same way as a wheel-barrow.
In the interior is one of Kent’s Patent Knife-cleaning
Machines, worked by turning a handle.
Then there are the cat and dog’s-meat barrows.
These, however, are merely common wheelbarrows,
with a board in front and a ledge or shelf,
formed by a piece of board nailed across the
top of the barrow, to answer the purpose of a
cutting-board. Lastly, there is the hearth-stone
barrow, piled up with hearth-stone, Bath-brick,
and lumps of whiting.</p>

<p>Another mode of conveying the goods through
the streets, is by baskets of various kinds; as
the sieve or head basket; the square and oval
“shallow,” fastened in front of the fruit-woman
with a strap round the waist; the hand-basket;
and the “prickle.” The sieve, or head-basket,
is a round willow basket, containing about one-third
of a bushel. The square and oval shallows
are willow baskets, about four inches deep, and
thirty inches long, by eighteen broad. The
hand-basket is the common oval basket, with
a handle across to hang upon the arm; the
latter are generally used by the Irish for onions
and apples. The prickle is a brown willow
basket, in which walnuts are imported into this
country from the Continent; they are about
thirty inches deep, and in bulk rather larger
than a gallon measure; they are used only by
the vendors of walnuts.</p>

<p>Such are the principal forms of the costermongers’
conveyances; but besides carts, barrows,
and baskets, there are many other means
adopted by the London street-sellers for carrying
their goods from one part of the metropolis to
another. The principal of these are cans, trays,
boxes, and poles.</p>

<p>The baked potato-cans sometimes are square
and sometimes oval; they are made with and
without legs, a lid fastened on with hinges, and
have a small charcoal fire fixed at the bottom
of the can, so as to keep the potatoes hot, while
there is a pipe at top to let off the steam. On
one side of the can is a little compartment for the
salt, and another on the other side for the butter.
The hot pie-can is a square tin can, standing
upon four legs, with a door in front, and three
partitions inside; a fire is kept in the bottom,
and the pies arranged in order upon the iron
plates or shelves. When the pies at the bottom
are sufficiently hot they are taken out, and
placed on the upper shelf, whilst those above are
removed to the lower compartments, by which
means all the pies are kept “hot and hot.”</p>

<p>The muffin and crumpet-boy carries his
articles in a basket, covered outside with oil-cloth
and inside with green-baize, either at his
back, or slung over his arm, and rings his bell
as he walks.</p>

<p>The blacking boy, congreve-match and water-cress
girl, use a rusty tray, spread over with
their “goods,” and suspended to the neck by a
piece of string.</p>

<p>The vendors of corn-salve, plating balls, soap
for removing grease spots, paper, steel pens,
envelopes, &amp;c., carry their commodities in front
of them in boxes, suspended round the neck by
a narrow leather strap.</p>

<p>Rabbits and game are sometimes carried in
baskets, and at other times tied together and
slung over a pole upon the shoulder. Hat and
bonnet-boxes are likewise conveyed upon a pole.</p>

<p>Door-mats, baskets and “duffer’s” packs,
wood pails, brushes, brooms, clothes-props,
clothes-lines and string, and grid-irons, Dutch-ovens,
skewers and fire-shovels, are carried
across the shoulder.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Smithfield Races.”</span></h3>

<p>Having set forth the costermonger’s usual mode
of conveying his goods through the streets of
London, I shall now give the reader a description
of the place and scene where and when he
purchases his donkeys.</p>

<p>When a costermonger wishes to sell or buy a
donkey, he goes to Smithfield-market on a Friday
afternoon. On this day, between the hours
of one and five, there is a kind of fair held,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
attended solely by costermongers, for whose convenience
a long paved slip of ground, about eighty
feet in length, has been set apart. The animals
for sale are trotted up and down this&mdash;the “race-course,”
as it is called&mdash;and on each side of it
stand the spectators and purchasers, crowding
among the stalls of peas-soup, hot eels, and other
street delicacies.</p>

<p>Every thing necessary for the starting of a
costermonger’s barrow can be had in Smithfield
on a Friday,&mdash;from the barrow itself to the
weights&mdash;from the donkey to the whip. The
animals can be purchased at prices ranging from
5<i>s.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> On a brisk market-day as many as
two hundred donkeys have been sold. The barrows
for sale are kept apart from the steeds, but
harness to any amount can be found everywhere,
in all degrees of excellence, from the bright
japanned cart saddle with its new red pads, to
the old mouldy trace covered with buckle marks.
Wheels of every size and colour, and springs in
every stage of rust, are hawked about on all
sides. To the usual noise and shouting of a
Saturday night’s market is added the shrill
squealing of distant pigs, the lowing of the
passing oxen, the bleating of sheep, and the
braying of donkeys. The paved road all down
the “race-course” is level and soft, with the
mud trodden down between the stones. The
policeman on duty there wears huge fishermen’s
or flushermen’s boots, reaching to their thighs;
and the trouser ends of the costers’ corduroys
are black and sodden with wet dirt. Every
variety of odour fills the air; you pass from
the stable smell that hangs about the donkeys,
into an atmosphere of apples and fried fish, near
the eating-stalls, while a few paces further on
you are nearly choked with the stench of goats.
The crowd of black hats, thickly dotted with red
and yellow plush caps, reels about; and the
“hi-hi-i-i” of the donkey-runners sounds on all
sides. Sometimes a curly-headed bull, with a
fierce red eye, on its way to or from the adjacent
cattle-market, comes trotting down the road,
making all the visitors rush suddenly to the
railings, for fear&mdash;as a coster near me said&mdash;of
“being taught the hornpipe.”</p>

<p>The donkeys standing for sale are ranged in
a long line on both sides of the “race-course,”
their white velvetty noses resting on the wooden
rail they are tied to. Many of them wear
their blinkers and head harness, and others are
ornamented with ribbons, fastened in their halters.
The lookers-on lean against this railing,
and chat with the boys at the donkeys’ heads,
or with the men who stand behind them,
and keep continually hitting and shouting at
the poor still beasts to make them prance.
Sometimes a party of two or three will be seen
closely examining one of these “Jerusalem
ponys,” passing their hands down its legs, or
looking quietly on, while the proprietor’s ash
stick descends on the patient brute’s back,
making a dull hollow sound. As you walk in
front of the long line of donkeys, the lads seize
the animals by their nostrils, and show their
large teeth, asking if you “want a hass, sir,”
and all warranting the creature to be “five
years old next buff-day.” Dealers are quarrelling
among themselves, downcrying each other’s
goods. “A hearty man,” shouted one proprietor,
pointing to his rival’s stock, “could eat three
sich donkeys as yourn at a meal.”</p>

<p>One fellow, standing behind his steed, shouts
as he strikes, “Here’s the real Brittannia
mettle;” whilst another asks, “Who’s for the
Pride of the Market?” and then proceeds to flip
“the pride” with his whip, till she clears away
the mob with her kickings. Here, standing by
its mother, will be a shaggy little colt, with a
group of ragged boys fondling it, and lifting it
in their arms from the ground.</p>

<p>During all this the shouts of the drivers and
runners fill the air, as they rush past each
other on the race-course. Now a tall fellow,
dragging a donkey after him, runs by crying,
as he charges in amongst the mob, “Hulloa!
Hulloa! hi! hi!” his mate, with his long coat-tails
flying in the wind, hurrying after and roaring,
between his blows, “Keem-up!”</p>

<p>On nearly every post are hung traces or
bridles; and in one place, on the occasion of my
visit, stood an old collar with a donkey nibbling
at the straw that had burst out. Some of the
lads, in smock-frocks, walk about with cart-saddles
on their heads, and crowds gather
round the trucks, piled up with a black heap
of harness studded with brass. Those without
trays have spread out old sacks on the ground,
on which are laid axle-trees, bound-up springs,
and battered carriage-lamps. There are plenty
of rusty nails and iron bolts to be had, if a
barrow should want mending; and if the handles
are broken, an old cab-shaft can be bought
cheap, to repair them.</p>

<p>In another “race-course,” opposite to the
donkeys,&mdash;the ponies are sold. These make a
curious collection, each one showing what was
his last master’s whim. One has its legs and
belly shorn of its hair, another has its mane
and tail cut close, and some have switch tails,
muddy at the end from their length. A big-hipped
black nag, with red tinsel-like spots on
its back, had its ears cut close, and another
curly-haired brute that was wet and steaming
with having been shown off, had two huge
letters burnt into its hind-quarters. Here the
clattering of the hoofs and the smacking of
whips added to the din; and one poor brute,
with red empty eye-holes, and carrying its head
high up&mdash;as a blind man does&mdash;sent out showers
of sparks from its hoofs as it spluttered over
the stones, at each blow it received. Occasionally,
in one part of the pony market, there may
be seen a crowd gathered round a nag, that
some one swears has been stolen from him.</p>

<p>Raised up over the heads of the mob are
bundles of whips, and men push their way past,
with their arms full of yellow-handled curry-combs;
whilst, amongst other cries, is heard that
of “Sticks &frac12;<i>d.</i> each! sticks&mdash;real smarters.”
At one end of the market the barrows for sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are kept piled up one on another, or filled
with old wheels, and some with white unpainted
wood, showing where they have been
repaired. Men are here seen thumping the
wooden trays, and trying the strength of the
springs by leaning on them; and here, too,
stood, on the occasion of my visit, a ragged
coster lad trying to sell his scales, now the
cherry-season had past.</p>

<p>On all sides the refreshment-barrows are surrounded
by customers. The whelk-man peppers
his lots, and shouts, “A lumping penn’orth for a
ha’penny;” and a lad in a smock-frock carries
two full pails of milk, slopping it as he walks, and
crying, “Ha’penny a mug-full, new milk from
the ke-ow!” The only quiet people to be seen
are round the peas-soup stall, with their cups in
their hands; and there is a huge crowd covering
in the hot-eel stand, with the steam rising
up in the centre. Baskets of sliced cake, apples,
nuts, and pine-apple rock, block up the pathway;
and long wicker baskets of live fowls hem
you in, round which are grouped the costers,
handling and blowing apart the feathers on the
breast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Donkeys of the Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The costermongers almost universally treat
their donkeys with kindness. Many a costermonger
will resent the ill-treatment of a
donkey, as he would a personal indignity.
These animals are often not only favourites, but
pets, having their share of the costermonger’s
dinner when bread forms a portion of it, or
pudding, or anything suited to the palate of the
brute. Those well-used, manifest fondness for
their masters, and are easily manageable; it is,
however, difficult to get an ass, whose master
goes regular rounds, away from its stable for
any second labour during the day, unless it has
fed and slept in the interval. The usual fare
of a donkey is a peck of chaff, which costs 1<i>d.</i>,
a quart of oats and a quart of beans, each
averaging 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and sometimes a pennyworth
of hay, being an expenditure of 4<i>d.</i> or 5<i>d.</i>
a day; but some give double this quantity in a
prosperous time. Only one meal a day is given.
Many costermongers told me, that their donkeys
lived well when they themselves lived well.</p>

<p>“It’s all nonsense to call donkeys stupid,”
said one costermonger to me; “them’s stupid that
calls them so: they’re sensible. Not long since
I worked Guildford with my donkey-cart and a
boy. Jack (the donkey) was slow and heavy in
coming back, until we got in sight of the lights
at Vauxhall-gate, and then he trotted on like
one o’clock, he did indeed! just as if he smelt
it was London besides seeing it, and knew he
was at home. He had a famous appetite in the
country, and the fresh grass did him good. I
gave a country lad 2<i>d.</i> to mind him in a green
lane there. I wanted my own boy to do so, but
he said, ‘I’ll see you further first.’ A London
boy hates being by himself in a lone country
part. He’s afraid of being burked; he is
indeed. One can’t quarrel with a lad when
he’s away with one in the country; he’s very
useful. I feed my donkey well. I sometimes
give him a carrot for a luxury, but carrots are
dear now. He’s fond of mashed potatoes, and
has many a good mash when I can buy them at
4lb. a penny.”</p>

<p>“There was a friend of mine,” said another
man, “had great trouble about his donkey a
few months back. I saw part of it, and knew
all about it. He was doing a little work on a
Sunday morning at Wandsworth, and the poor
thing fell down dead. He was very fond of his
donkey and kind to it, and the donkey was very
fond of him. He thought he wouldn’t leave
the poor creature he’d had a good while, and
had been out with in all weathers, by the road
side; so he dropped all notion of doing business,
and with help got the poor dead thing into his
cart; its head lolloping over the end of the
cart, and its poor eyes staring at nothing.
He thought he’d drag it home and bury it
somewheres. It wasn’t for the value he dragged
it, for what’s a dead donkey worth? There
was a few persons about him, and they was all
quiet and seemed sorry for the poor fellow and
for his donkey; but the church-bells struck up,
and up came a ‘crusher,’ and took the man up,
and next day he was fined 10<i>s.</i>, I can’t exactly
say for what. He never saw no more of the
animal, and lost his stock as well as his
donkey.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers’ Capital.</span></h3>

<p>The costermongers, though living by buying
and selling, are seldom or never capitalists. It
is estimated that not more than one-fourth of the
entire body trade upon their own property.
Some borrow their stock money, others borrow
the stock itself, others again borrow the donkey-carts,
barrows, or baskets, in which their stock
is carried round, whilst others borrow even the
weights and measures by which it is meted out.</p>

<p>The reader, however uninformed he may be as
to the price the poor usually have to pay for any
loans they may require, doubtlessly need not be
told that the remuneration exacted for the use
of the above-named commodities is not merely
confined to the legal 5<i>l.</i> per centum per annum;
still many of even the most “knowing” will
hardly be able to credit the fact that the ordinary
rate of interest in the costermongers’ money-market
amounts to 20 per cent. per week, or no
less than 1040<i>l.</i> a year, for every 100<i>l.</i> advanced.</p>

<p>But the iniquity of this usury in the present
instance is felt, not so much by the costermongers
themselves, as by the poor people whom
they serve; for, of course, the enormous rate of
interest must be paid out of the profits on the
goods they sell, and consequently added to the
price, so that coupling this overcharge with the
customary short allowance&mdash;in either weight or
measure, as the case may be&mdash;we can readily
perceive how cruelly the poor are defrauded, and
how they not only get often too little for what
they do, but have as often to pay too much for
what they buy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Premising thus much, I shall now proceed to
describe the terms upon which the barrow, the
cart, the basket, the weights, the measures, the
stock-money, or the stock, is usually advanced
to the needy costermongers by their more
thrifty brethren.</p>

<p>The hire of a barrow is 3<i>d.</i> a day, or 1<i>s.</i> a
week, for the six winter months; and 4<i>d.</i> a day,
or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, for the six summer months.
Some are to be had rather lower in the summer,
but never for less than 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;sometimes for not less
than 6<i>d.</i> on a Saturday, when not unfrequently
every barrow in London is hired. No security
and no deposit is required, but the lender satisfies
himself that the borrower is really what he
represents himself to be. I am informed that
5,000 hired barrows are now in the hands of the
London costermongers, at an average rental of
3<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> each, or 16,250<i>l.</i> a year. One man lets
out 120 yearly, at a return (dropping the 5<i>s.</i>) of
360<i>l.</i>; while the cost of a good barrow, new, is
2<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>, and in the autumn and winter they may
be bought new, or “as good as new,” at 30<i>s.</i>
each; so that reckoning each to cost this barrow-letter
2<i>l.</i>, he receives 360<i>l.</i> rent or interest&mdash;exactly
150 per cent. per annum for property
which originally cost but 240<i>l.</i>, and
property which is still as good for the ensuing
year’s business as for the past. One man has
rented a barrow for eight years, during which period
he has paid 26<i>l.</i> for what in the first instance
did not cost more than twice as many shillings,
and which he must return if he discontinues its
use. “I know men well to do,” said an intelligent
costermonger, “who have paid 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week for a barrow for three, four, and five
years; and they can’t be made to understand
that it’s rather high rent for what might cost
40<i>s.</i> at first. They can’t see they are losers.
One barrow-lender sends his son out, mostly on
a Sunday, collecting his rents (for barrows), but
he’s not a hard man.” Some of the lenders
complain that their customers pay them irregularly
and cheat them often, and that in consequence
they must charge high; while the
“borrowers” declare that it is very seldom indeed
that a man “shirks” the rent for his barrow,
generally believing that he has made an advantageous
bargain, and feeling the want of his
vehicle, if he lose it temporarily. Let the
lenders, however, be deceived by many, still, it
is evident, that the rent charged for barrows is
most exorbitant, by the fact, that all who take
to the business become men of considerable
property in a few years.</p>

<p>Donkey-carts are rarely hired. “If there’s
2,000 donkey and pony-carts in London, more
or less, not 200 of them’s borrowed; but of
barrows five to two is borrowed.” A donkey-cart
costs from 2<i>l.</i> to 10<i>l.</i>; 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> being an
average price. The hire is 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week.
The harness costs 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> new, but is bought,
nineteen times out of twenty, second-hand, at
from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> The donkeys themselves
are not let out on hire, though a costermonger
may let out his donkey to another in the trade
when he does not require its services; the usual
sum paid for the hire of a donkey is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or
3<i>s.</i> per week. The cost price of a pony varies
from 5<i>l.</i> to 13<i>l.</i>; that of a donkey from 1<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i>
There may be six donkeys, or more, in costermonger
use, to one pony. Some traffic almost
weekly in these animals, liking the excitement
of such business.</p>

<p>The repairs to barrows, carts, and harness are
almost always effected by the costermongers
themselves.</p>

<p>“Shallows” (baskets) which cost 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
are let out at 1<i>d.</i> a day; but not five in 100 of
those in use are borrowed, as their low price
places them at the costermonger’s command.
A pewter quart-pot, for measuring onions, &amp;c.,
is let out at 2<i>d.</i> a day, its cost being 2<i>s.</i> Scales
are 2<i>d.</i>, and a set of weights 1<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p>Another common mode of usury is in the
lending of stock-money. This is lent by the
costermongers who have saved the means for
such use of their funds, and by beer-shop
keepers. The money-lending costermongers
are the most methodical in their usury&mdash;1,040<i>l.</i>
per cent. per annum, as was before
stated, being the rate of interest usually charged.
It is seldom that a lower sum than 10<i>s.</i> is borrowed,
and never a higher sum than 2<i>l.</i> When
a stranger applies for a loan, the money-lender
satisfies himself as I have described of the barrow-lender.
He charges 2<i>d.</i> a day for a loan
of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 3<i>d.</i> a day for 5<i>s.</i>; 6<i>d.</i> a day for 10<i>s.</i>;
and 1<i>s.</i> a day for 1<i>l.</i> If the daily payments are
rendered regularly, at a month’s end the terms
are reduced to 6<i>d.</i> a week for 5<i>s.</i>; 1<i>s.</i> for 10<i>s.</i>;
and 2<i>s.</i> for 1<i>l.</i> “That’s reckoned an extraordinary
small interest,” was said to me, “only
4<i>d.</i> a day for a pound.” The average may be 3<i>s.</i>
a week for the loan of 20<i>s.</i>; it being only to a
few that a larger sum than 20<i>s.</i> is lent. “I paid
2<i>s.</i> a week for 1<i>l.</i> for a whole year,” said one
man, “or 5<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> for the use of a pound, and then
I was liable to repay the 1<i>l.</i>” The principal,
however, is seldom repaid; nor does the lender
seem to expect it, though he will occasionally
demand it. One money-lender is considered to
have a floating capital of 150<i>l.</i> invested in loans
to costermongers. If he receive 2<i>s.</i> per week per
1<i>l.</i> for but twenty-six weeks in the year (and he
often receives it for the fifty-two weeks)&mdash;his
150<i>l.</i> brings him in 390<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Sometimes a loan is effected only for a day,
generally a Saturday, as much as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> being
sometimes given for the use of 5<i>s.</i>; the 5<i>s.</i> being
of course repaid in the evening.</p>

<p>The money-lenders are subject to at least
twice the extent of loss to which the barrow-lender
is exposed, as it is far oftener that money
is squandered (on which of course no interest
can be paid) than that a barrow is disposed of.</p>

<p>The money-lenders, (from the following statement,
made to me by one who was in the habit
of borrowing,) pursue their business in a not
very dissimilar manner to that imputed to those
who advance larger sums:&mdash;“If I want to borrow
in a hurry,” said my informant, “as I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hear of a good bargain, I run to my neighbour
L&mdash;&mdash;’s, and he first says he hasn’t 20<i>s.</i> to lend,
and his wife’s by, and she says she hasn’t 2<i>s.</i> in
her pocket, and so I can’t be accommodated.
Then he says if I must have the money he’ll
have to pawn his watch,&mdash;or to borrow it of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;, (an innkeeper) who would charge a deal
of interest, for he wasn’t paid all he lent two
months back, and 1<i>s.</i> would be expected to be
spent in drink&mdash;though L&mdash;&mdash; don’t drink&mdash;or he
must try if his sister would trust him, but she was
sick and wanted all her money&mdash;or perhaps his
barrow-merchant would lend him 10<i>s.</i>, if he’d
undertake to return 15<i>s.</i> at night; and it ends by
my thinking I’ve done pretty well if I can get
1<i>l.</i> for 5<i>s.</i> interest, for a day’s use of it.”</p>

<p>The beer-shop keepers lend on far easier
terms, perhaps at half the interest exacted by
the others, and without any regular system of
charges; but they look sharp after the repayment,
and expect a considerable outlay in beer,
and will only lend to good customers; they however
have even lent money without interest.</p>

<p>“In the depth of last winter,” said a man of
good character to me, “I borrowed 5<i>s.</i> The
beer-shop keeper wouldn’t lend; he’ll rather
lend to men doing well and drinking. But I
borrowed it at 6<i>d.</i> a day interest, and that 6<i>d.</i>
a day I paid exactly four weeks, Sundays and
all; and that was 15<i>s.</i> in thirty days for the use
of 5<i>s.</i> I was half starving all the time, and then
I had a slice of luck, and paid the 5<i>s.</i> back slap,
and got out of it.”</p>

<p>Many shopkeepers lend money to the stall-keepers,
whom they know from standing near
their premises, and that without interest. They
generally lend, however, to the women, as they
think the men want to get drunk with it.
“Indeed, if it wasn’t for the women,” said a
costermonger to me, “half of us might go to
the Union.”</p>

<p>Another mode of usurious lending or trading
is, as I said before, to provide the costermonger&mdash;not
with the stock-money&mdash;but with the stock
itself. This mode also is highly profitable to
the usurer, who is usually a costermonger, but
sometimes a greengrocer. A stock of fruit, fish,
or vegetables, with a barrow for its conveyance,
is entrusted to a street-seller, the usual way
being to “let him have a sovereign’s worth.”
The value of this, however, at the market cost,
rarely exceeds 14<i>s.</i>, still the man entrusted with
it must carry 20<i>s.</i> to his creditor, or he will
hardly be trusted a second time. The man
who trades with the stock is not required
to pay the 20<i>s.</i> on the first day of the transaction,
as he may not have realised so much,
but he must pay some of it, generally 10<i>s.</i>,
and must pay the remainder the next day or
the money-lender will decline any subsequent
dealings.</p>

<p>It may be thought, as no security is given,
and as the costermongering barrow, stock, or
money-lender never goes to law for the recovery
of any debt or goods, that the per centage is
not so very exorbitant after all. But I ascertained
that not once in twenty times was the
money lender exposed to any loss by the non-payment
of his usurious interest, while his
profits are enormous. The borrower knows
that if he fail in his payment, the lender will
acquaint the other members of his fraternity,
so that no future loan will be attainable, and
the costermonger’s business may be at an end.
One borrower told me that the re-payment of
his loan of 2<i>l.</i>, borrowed two years ago at 4<i>s.</i> a
week, had this autumn been reduced to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week: “He’s a decent man I pay now,” he
said; “he has twice forgiven me a month at a
time when the weather was very bad and the
times as bad as the weather. Before I borrowed
of him I had dealings with &mdash;&mdash;. He <i>was</i> a
scurf. If I missed a week, and told him I
would make it up next week, ‘That won’t do,’
he’d say, ‘I’ll turn you up. I’ll take d&mdash;&mdash;d
good care to stop you. <i>I’ll</i> have you to rights.’
If I hadn’t satisfied him, as I did at last, I
could never have got credit again; never.” I
am informed that most of the money-lenders,
if a man has paid for a year or so, will now
“drop it for a month or so in a very hard-up
time, and go on again.” There is no I.O.U.
or any memorandum given to the usurer.
“There’s never a slip of paper about it, sir,”
I was told.</p>

<p>I may add that a very intelligent man from
whom I derived information, said to me concerning
costermongers never going to law to
recover money owing to them, nor indeed for
any purpose: “If any one steals anything from
me&mdash;and that, as far as I know, never happened
but once in ten years&mdash;and I catch him, I take
it out of him on the spot. I give him a jolly
good hiding and there’s an end of it. I know
very well, sir, that costers are ignorant men, but
in my opinion” (laughing) “our never going
to law shows that in <i>that</i> point we are in
advance of the aristocrats. I never heard of a
coster in a law court, unless he was in trouble
(charged with some offence)&mdash;for assaulting a
crusher, or anybody he had quarrelled with, or
something of that kind.”</p>

<p>The barrow-lender, when not regularly paid,
sends some one, or goes himself, and carries
away the barrow.</p>

<p>My personal experience with this peculiar
class justifies me in saying that they are far
less dishonest than they are usually believed to
be, and much more honest than their wandering
habits, their want of education and “principle”
would lead even the most charitable to suppose.
Since I have exhibited an interest in the sufferings
and privations of these neglected people,
I have, as the reader may readily imagine, had
many applications for assistance, and without
vanity, I believe I may say, that as far as
my limited resources would permit, I have
striven to extricate the street-sellers from the
grasp of the usurer. Some to whom I have
<i>lent</i> small sums (for gifts only degrade struggling
honest men into the apathy of beggars)
have taken the money with many a protesta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>tion
that they would repay it in certain weekly
instalments, which they themselves proposed, but
still have never made their appearance before
me a second time&mdash;it may be from dishonesty
and it may be from inability and shame&mdash;others,
however, and they are not a few, have
religiously kept faith with me, calling punctually
to pay back a sixpence or a shilling as the
precariousness of their calling would permit,
and doing this, though they knew that I abjured
all claims upon them but through their honour,
and was, indeed, in most cases, ignorant where
to find them, even if my inclination led me to
seek or enforce a return of the loan. One case
of this kind shows so high a sense of honour
among a class, generally considered to rank
among the most dishonourable, that, even at the
risk of being thought egotistical, I will mention
it here:&mdash;“Two young men, street-sellers,
called upon me and begged hard for the loan of
a little stock-money. They made needle-cases
and hawked them from door to door at the east
end of the town, and had not the means of buying
the wood. I agreed to let them have ten
shillings between them; this they promised to
repay at a shilling a week. They were utter
strangers to me; nevertheless, at the end of the
first week one shilling of the sum was duly
returned. The second week, however, brought
no shilling, nor did the third, nor the fourth, by
which time I got to look upon the money as
lost; but at the end of the fifth week one of the
men called with his sixpence, and told me how
he should have been with me before but his
mate had promised each week to meet him with
his sixpence, and each week disappointed him;
so he had come on alone. I thanked him, and
the next week he came again; so he did the
next, and the next after that. On the latter
occasion he told me that in five more weeks he
should have paid off his half of the amount
advanced, and that then, as he had come with
the other man, he would begin paying off <i>his</i>
share as well!”</p>

<p>Those who are unacquainted with the character
of the people may feel inclined to doubt the
trustworthiness of the class, but it is an extraordinary
fact that but few of the costermongers
fail to repay the money advanced to them, even
at the present ruinous rate of interest. The
poor, it is my belief, have not yet been sufficiently
tried in this respect;&mdash;pawnbrokers, loan-offices,
tally-shops, dolly-shops, are the only
parties who will trust them&mdash;but, as a startling
proof of the good faith of the humbler classes
generally, it may be stated that Mrs. Chisholm
(the lady who has exerted herself so benevolently
in the cause of emigration) has lent out, at different
times, as much as 160,000<i>l.</i> that has been
entrusted to her for the use of the “lower
orders,” and that the whole of this large amount
has been returned&mdash;<i>with the exception of</i> 12<i>l.</i>!</p>

<p>I myself have often given a sovereign
to professed thieves to get “changed,” and
never knew one to make off with the money.
Depend upon it, if we would really improve,
we must begin by elevating instead of degrading.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Slang” Weights and Measures.</span></h3>

<p>All counterfeit weights and measures, the
costermongers call by the appropriate name of
“slang.” “There are not half so many
slangs as there was eighteen months ago,”
said a ‘general dealer’ to me. “You see,
sir, the letters in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> set
people a talking, and some altered their way of
business. Some was very angry at what was
said in the articles on the street-sellers, and
swore that costers was gentlemen, and that
they’d smash the men’s noses that had told
you, sir, if they knew who they were. There’s
plenty of costers wouldn’t use slangs at all, if
people would give a fair price; but you see
the boys <i>will</i> try it on for their bunts, and how
is a man to sell fine cherries at 4<i>d.</i> a pound
that cost him 3&frac12;<i>d.</i>, when there’s a kid alongside
of him a selling his ‘tol’ at 2<i>d.</i> a pound, and
singing it out as bold as brass? So the men
slangs it, and cries ‘2<i>d.</i> a pound,’ and gives
half-pound, as the boy does; which brings it to
the same thing. We doesn’t ’dulterate our
goods like the tradesmen&mdash;that is, the regular
hands doesn’t. It wouldn’t be easy, as you say,
to ’dulterate cabbages or oysters; but we deals
fair to all that’s fair to us,&mdash;and that’s more
than many a tradesman does, for all their
juries.”</p>

<p>The slang quart is a pint and a half. It is
made precisely like the proper quart; and the
maker, I was told, “knows well enough what it’s
for, as it’s charged, new, 6<i>d.</i> more than a true
quart measure; but it’s nothing to him, as he
says, what it’s for, so long as he gets his price.”
The slang quart is let out at 2<i>d.</i> a day&mdash;1<i>d.</i> extra
being charged “for the risk.” The slang pint
holds in some cases three-fourths of the just
quantity, having a very thick bottom; others
hold only half a pint, having a false bottom
half-way up. These are used chiefly in measuring
nuts, of which the proper quantity is
hardly ever given to the purchaser; “but, then,”
it was often said, or implied to me, the “price is
all the lower, and people just brings it on themselves,
by wanting things for next to nothing;
so it’s all right; it’s people’s own faults.” The
hire of the slang pint is 2<i>d.</i> per day.</p>

<p>The scales used are almost all true, but the
weights are often beaten out flat to look large,
and are 4, 5, 6, or even 7 oz. deficient in a pound,
and in the same relative proportion with other
weights. The charge is 2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, and 4<i>d.</i> a day
for a pair of scales and a set of slang weights.</p>

<p>The wooden measures&mdash;such as pecks, half
pecks, and quarter pecks&mdash;are not let out slang,
but the bottoms are taken out by the costers, and
put in again half an inch or so higher up. “I
call this,” said a humorous dealer to me, “slop-work,
or the cutting-system.”</p>

<p>One candid costermonger expressed his perfect
contempt of slangs, as fit only for bunglers,
as <i>he</i> could always “work slang” with a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
measure. “Why, I can cheat any man,” he
said. “I can manage to measure mussels so
as you’d think you got a lot over, but there’s
a lot under measure, for I holds them up with
my fingers and keep crying, ‘Mussels! full
measure, live mussels!’ I can do the same
with peas. I delight to do it with stingy aristocrats.
We don’t work slang in the City.
People know what they’re a buying on there.
There’s plenty of us would pay for an inspector
of weights; I would. We might do fair without
an inspector, and make as much if we only
agreed one with another.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is but just I should add that
there seems to be a strong disposition on the
part of the more enlightened of the class to
adopt the use of fair weights and measures; and
that even among the less scrupulous portion of
the body, short allowance seems to be given
chiefly from a desire to be <i>even</i> with a “scaly
customer.” The coster makes it a rule never
to refuse an offer, and if people <i>will</i> give him
less than what he considers his proper price,
why&mdash;he gives them less than their proper quantity.
As a proof of the growing honesty among
this class, many of the better disposed have recently
formed themselves into a society, the
members of which are (one and all) pledged not
only to deal fairly with their customers, but to
compel all other street-sellers to do the same.
With a view of distinguishing themselves to the
public, they have come to the resolution of wearing
a medal, on which shall be engraved a particular
number, so that should any imposition
be practised by any of their body, the public
will have the opportunity of complaining to the
Committee of the Association, and having the
individual (if guilty) immediately expelled from
the society.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Half Profits.</span></h3>

<p>Besides the modes of trading on borrowed
capital above described, there is still another
means of obtaining stock prevalent among the
London costermongers. It is a common practice
with some of the more provident costermongers,
who buy more largely&mdash;for the sake
of buying cheaply&mdash;than is required for the
supply of their own customers, to place goods
in the hands of young men who are unable
to buy goods on their own account, “on half
profits,” as it is called. The man adopting
this means of doing a more extensive business,
says to any poor fellow willing to work on
those terms, “Here’s a barrow of vegetables
to carry round, and the profit on them will be
2<i>s.</i>; you sell them, and half is for yourself.”
The man sells them accordingly; if however
he fail to realize the 2<i>s.</i> anticipated profit, his
employer must still be paid 1<i>s.</i>, even if the
“seller” prove that only 13<i>d.</i> was cleared; so
that the costermonger capitalist, as he may be
described, is always, to use the words of one
of my informants, “on the profitable side of
the hedge.”</p>

<p>Boys are less frequently employed on half-profits
than young men; and I am assured that
instances of these young men wronging their
employers are hardly ever known.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Boys of the Costermongers,
and their Bunts.</span></h3>

<p>But there are still other “agents” among the
costermongers, and these are the “boys” deputed
to sell a man’s goods for a certain sum,
all over that amount being the boys’ profit
or “bunts.” Almost every costermonger who
trades through the streets with his barrow is
accompanied by a boy. The ages of these lads
vary from ten to sixteen, there are few above
sixteen, for the lads think it is then high time
for them to start on their own account. These
boys are useful to the man in “calling,”
their shrill voices being often more audible than
the loudest pitch of an adult’s lungs. Many
persons, moreover, I am assured, prefer buying
of a boy, believing that if the lad did not succeed
in selling his goods he would be knocked
about when he got home; others think that they
are safer in a boy’s hands, and less likely to be
cheated; these, however, are equally mistaken
notions. The boys also are useful in pushing at
the barrow, or in drawing it along by tugging at a
rope in front. Some of them are the sons of the
costermongers; some go round to the costermongers’
abodes and say: “Will you want me
to-morrow?” “Shall I come and give you a
lift?” The parents of the lads thus at large are,
when they <i>have</i> parents, either unable to support
them, or, if able, prefer putting their money
to other uses, (such as drinking); and so the lads
have to look out for themselves, or, as they say,
“pick up a few halfpence and a bit of grub as
we can.” Such lads, however, are the smallest
class of costermongering youths; and are sometimes
called “cas’alty boys,” or “nippers.”</p>

<p>The boys&mdash;and nearly the whole of them&mdash;soon
become very quick, and grow masters of
slang, in from six weeks to two or three months.
“I suppose,” said one man familiar with their
character, “they’d learn French as soon, if they
was thrown into the way of it. They must
learn slang to live, and as they have to wait at
markets every now and then, from one hour to
six, they associate one with another and carry
on conversations in slang about the “penny gaffs”
(theatres), criticising the actors; or may be they
toss the pieman, if they’ve got any ha’pence,
or else they chaff the passers by. The older
ones may talk about their sweethearts; but
they always speak of them by the name of
‘nammow’ (girls).</p>

<p>“The boys are severe critics too (continued
my informant) on dancing. I heard one say
to another; ‘What do you think of Johnny
Millicent’s new step?’ for they always recognise
a new step, or they discuss the female dancer’s
legs, and not very decently. At other times
the boys discuss the merits or demerits of their
masters, as to who feeds them best. I have
heard one say, ‘O, aint Bob stingy? We have
bread and cheese!’ Another added; ‘<i>We</i> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
steak and beer, and I’ve the use of Bill’s, (the
master’s) ’baccy box.’”</p>

<p>Some of these lads are paid by the day,
generally from 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> and their food, and as
much fruit as they think fit to eat, as by that
they soon get sick of it. They generally carry
home fruit in their pockets for their playmates,
or brothers, or sisters; the costermongers allow
this, if they are satisfied that the pocketing
is not for sale. Some lads are engaged by
the week, having from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and their
food when out with their employer. Their
lodging is found only in a few cases, and then
they sleep in the same room with their master and
mistress. Of master or mistress, however, they
never speak, but of Jack and Bet. They behave
respectfully to the women, who are generally
kind to them. They soon desert a very surly
or stingy master; though such a fellow could get
fifty boys next day if he wanted them, but not
lads used to the trade, for to these he’s well
known by their talk one with another, and they
soon tell a man his character very plainly&mdash;“<i>very</i>
plainly indeed, sir, and to his face too,” said one.</p>

<p>Some of these boys are well beaten by their
employers; this they put up with readily enough,
if they experience kindness at the hands of the
man’s wife; for, as I said before, parties that
have never thought of marriage, if they live together,
call one another husbands and wives.</p>

<p>In “working the country” these lads are put
on the same footing as their masters, with whom
they eat, drink, and sleep; but they do not
gamble with them. A few, however, go out and
tempt country boys to gamble, and&mdash;as an almost
inevitable consequence&mdash;to lose. “Some of the
boys,” said one who had seen it often, “will
keep a number of countrymen in a beer-shop in
a roar for the hour, while the countrymen ply
them with beer, and some of the street-lads can
drink a good deal. I’ve known three bits of boys
order a pot of beer each, one after the other,
each paying his share, and a quartern of gin each
after that&mdash;drunk neat; they don’t understand
water. Drink doesn’t seem to affect them as it
does men. I don’t know why.” “Some costermongers,”
said another informant, “have been
known, when they’ve taken a fancy to a boy&mdash;I
know of two&mdash;to dress him out like themselves,
silk handkerchiefs and all; for if they didn’t
find them silk handkerchiefs, the boys would
soon get them out of their ‘<i>bunts</i>.’ They like silk
handkerchiefs, for if they lose all their money
gambling, they can then pledge their handkerchiefs.”</p>

<p>I have mentioned the term “<i>bunts</i>.” Bunts is
the money made by the boys in this manner:&mdash;If
a costermonger, after having sold a sufficiency,
has 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> worth of goods left, and is anxious
to get home, he says to the boy, “Work these
streets, and bring me 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the tol,” (lot)
which the costermonger knows by his eye&mdash;for
he seldom measures or counts&mdash;is easily worth
that money. The lad then proceeds to sell the
things entrusted to him, and often shows great
ingenuity in so doing. If, for instance, turnips
be tied up in penny bunches, the lad will open
some of them, so as to spread them out to nearly
twice their previous size, and if any one ask if
that be a penn’orth, he will say, “Here’s a larger
for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, marm,” and so palm off a penny bunch
at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> Out of each bunch of onions he takes
one or two, and makes an extra bunch. All that
the lad can make in this way over the half-crown
is his own, and called “bunts.” Boys have made
from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> “bunts,” and this day after
day. Many of them will, in the course of their
traffic, beg old boots or shoes, if they meet with
better sort of people, and so “work it to rights,”
as they call it among themselves; servants often
give them cast-off clothes. It is seldom that a
boy carries home less than the stipulated sum.</p>

<p>The above is what is understood as “fair
bunts.”</p>

<p>“Unfair bunts” is what the lad may make
unknown to his master; as, if a customer call
from the area for goods cried at 2<i>d.</i>, the lad may
get 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, by pretending what he had carried was
a superior sort to that called at 2<i>d.</i>,&mdash;or by any
similar trick.</p>

<p>“I have known some civil and industrious
boys,” said a costermonger to me, “get to save
a few shillings, and in six months start with a
shallow, and so rise to a donkey-cart. The
greatest drawback to struggling boys is their
sleeping in low lodging-houses, where they are
frequently robbed, or trepanned to part with
their money, or else they get corrupted.”</p>

<p>Some men employ from four to twelve boys,
sending them out with shallows and barrows,
the boys bringing home the proceeds. The men
who send lads out in this way, count the things,
and can tell to a penny what can be realised on
them. They neither pay nor treat the boys well,
I am told, and are looked upon by the other
costermongers as extortioners, or unfair dealers,
making money by trading on poor lads’ necessities,
who serve them to avoid starvation. These
men are called “Scurfs.” If the boys working
for them make bunts, or are suspected of
making bunts, there is generally “a row” about
it.</p>

<p>The bunts is for the most part the gambling
money, as well as the money for the “penny
gaff,” the “twopenny hop,” the tobacco, and the
pudding money of the boys. “More would
save their wages and their bunts,” was said to
me on good authority, “but they have no
place to keep their money in, and don’t understand
anything about savings banks. Many of
these lads are looked on with suspicion by the
police, and treated like suspected folks; but in
my opinion they are not thieves, or they wouldn’t
work so hard; for a thief’s is a much easier life
than a costermonger’s.”</p>

<p>When a boy begins business on his own account,
or “sets up,” as they call it, he purchases
a shallow, which costs at least 1<i>s.</i>, and a half
hundred of herrings, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> By the sale of the
herrings he will clear 1<i>s.</i>, going the round he
has been accustomed to, and then trade on the
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Or, if it be fruit time, he will trade in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
apples until master of 5<i>s.</i>, and then “take to
a barrow,” at 3<i>d.</i> a day hire. By this system
the ranks of the costermongers are not only
recruited but increased. There is one grand
characteristic of these lads; I heard on all hands
they are, every one of them, what the costers call&mdash;“wide
awake.”</p>

<p>There are I am assured from 200 to 300
costers, who, in the busier times of the year,
send out four youths or lads each on an
average. The young men thus sent out generally
live with the costermonger, paying 7<i>s.</i>
a week for board, lodging and washing. These
youths, I was told by one who knew them
well, were people who “didn’t care to work for
themselves, because they couldn’t keep their
money together; it would soon all go; and they
<i>must</i> keep it together for their masters. They
are not fed badly, but then they make ‘bunts’
sometimes, and it goes for grub when they’re
out, so they eat less at home.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Juvenile Trading of the
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>My inquiries among the costermongers induced
one of their number to address me by letter.
My correspondent&mdash;a well-informed and well-educated
man&mdash;describes himself as “being
one of those that have been unfortunately thrust
into that precarious way of obtaining a living,
not by choice but circumstances.” The writer
then proceeds to say: “No person but those
actually connected with the streets can tell the
exertion, anxiety, and difficulties we have to
undergo; and I know for a fact it induces a
great many to drink that would not do so,
only to give them a stimulant to bear up
against the troubles that they have to contend
with; and so it ultimately becomes habitual.
I could point out many instances of the kind.
My chief object in addressing you is to give my
humble suggestion as to the best means of alleviating
our present position in society, and
establishing us in the eyes of the public as a
respectable body of men, honestly endeavouring
to support our families, without becoming
chargeable to the parish, and to show that we
are not all the degraded class we are at present
thought to be, subject to the derision of every
passer by, and all looked upon as extortioners
and the confederates of thieves. It is grievous
to see children, as soon as they are able to speak,
thrust into the streets to sell, and in many instances,
I am sorry to state, to support their
parents. Kind sir, picture to yourself a group
of those children mixing together indiscriminately&mdash;the
good with the bad&mdash;all uneducated&mdash;and
without that parental care which is so essential
for youth&mdash;and judge for yourself the result:
the lads in some instances take to thieving,
(this being easier for a living), and the girls to
prostitution; and so they pass the greater part of
their time in gaol, or get transported. Even
those who are honestly disposed cannot have a
chance of bettering their condition, in consequence
of their being uneducated, so that they
often turn out brutal husbands and bad fathers.
Surely, sir, Government could abolish in a
measure this juvenile trading, so conducive to
crime and so injurious to the shopkeeper, who
is highly rated. How is it possible, if children
congregate around his door with the very articles
he may deal in, that he can meet the demands
for rates and taxes; whereas the
educated man, brought by want to sell in the
streets, would not do so, but keep himself
apart from the shopkeeper, and not merit
his enmity, and the interference of the police,
which he necessarily claims. I have procured
an existence (with a few years’ exception) in the
streets for the last twenty-five years as a general
salesman of perishable and imperishable articles,
and should be most happy to see anything done
for the benefit of my class. This juvenile trading
I consider the root of the evil; after the removal
of this, the costermongers might, by classifying
and co-operation, render themselves comparatively
happy, in their position, and become
acknowledged members of society.”</p>

<p>Another costermonger, in conversing with me
concerning these young traders, said, that many
of them would ape the vices of men: mere
urchins would simulate drunkenness, or boast,
with many an exaggeration, of their drinking
feats. They can get as much as they please at
the public-houses; and this too, I may add,
despite the 43rd clause in the Police Act, which
enacts, that “every person, licensed to deal in
exciseable liquors within the said (Metropolitan
Police) District, who shall knowingly supply any
sort of distilled exciseable liquor to be drunk
upon the premises, to any boy or girl, apparently
under the age of sixteen years, shall be liable to
a penalty of not more than 20<i>s.</i>;” and upon a
second conviction to 40<i>s.</i> penalty; and on a
third to 5<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Education of the “Coster-Lads.”</span></h3>

<p>Among the costers the term education is (as I
have already intimated) merely understood as
meaning a complete knowledge of the art of
“buying in the cheapest market and selling in
the dearest.” There are few lads whose training
extends beyond this. The father is the tutor,
who takes the boy to the different markets,
instructs him in the art of buying, and when
the youth is perfect on this point, the parent’s
duty is supposed to have been performed.
Nearly all these boys are remarkable for their
precocious sharpness. To use the words of one
of the class, “these young ones are as sharp
as terriers, and learns every dodge of business
in less than half no time. There’s one I knows
about three feet high, that’s up to the business
as clever as a man of thirty. Though he’s only
twelve years old he’ll chaff down a peeler so
uncommon severe, that the only way to stop
him is to take him in charge!”</p>

<p>It is idle to imagine that these lads, possessed
of a mental acuteness almost wonderful, will
not educate themselves in vice, if we neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to train them to virtue. At their youthful
age, the power of acquiring knowledge is the
strongest, and some kind of education is continually
going on. If they are not taught by
others, they will form their own characters&mdash;developing
habits of dissipation, and educing
all the grossest passions of their natures, and
learning to indulge in the gratification of every
appetite without the least restraint.</p>

<p>As soon as a boy is old enough to shout well
and loudly, his father takes him into the streets.
Some of these youths are not above seven years
of age, and it is calculated that not more than
one in a hundred has ever been to a school of
any kind. The boy walks with the barrow, or
guides the donkey, shouting by turns with the
father, who, when the goods are sold, will as a
reward, let him ride home on the tray. The
lad attends all markets with his father, who
teaches him his business and shows him his
tricks of trade; “for,” said a coster, “a governor
in our line leaves the knowledge of all his
dodges to his son, jist as the rich coves do their
tin.”</p>

<p>The life of a coster-boy is a very hard one.
In summer he will have to be up by four
o’clock in the morning, and in winter he is
never in bed after six. When he has returned
from market, it is generally his duty
to wash the goods and help dress the barrow.
About nine he begins his day’s work, shouting
whilst the father pushes; and as very often the
man has lost his voice, this share of the
labour is left entirely to him. When a coster
has regular customers, the vegetables or fish
are all sold by twelve o’clock, and in many
coster families the lad is then packed off with
fruit to hawk in the streets. When the work
is over, the father will perhaps take the boy to
a public-house with him, and give him part of
his beer. Sometimes a child of four or five is
taken to the tap-room, especially if he be pretty
and the father proud of him. “I have seen,”
said a coster to me, “a baby of five year old
reeling drunk in a tap-room. His governor
did it for the lark of the thing, to see him chuck
hisself about&mdash;sillyfied like.”</p>

<p>The love of gambling soon seizes upon the
coster boy. Youths of about twelve or so will
as soon as they can get away from work go to
a public-house and play cribbage for pints of
beer, or for a pint a corner. They generally
continue playing till about midnight, and
rarely&mdash;except on a Sunday&mdash;keep it up all
night.</p>

<p>It ordinarily happens that when a lad is
about thirteen, he quarrels with his father, and
gets turned away from home. Then he is
forced to start for himself. He knows where
he can borrow stock-money and get his barrow,
for he is as well acquainted with the markets as
the oldest hand at the business, and children
may often be seen in the streets under-selling
their parents. “How’s it possible,” said a
woman, “for people to live when there’s their
own son at the end of the court a-calling his
goods as cheap again as we can afford to sell
ourn.”</p>

<p>If the boy is lucky in trade, his next want is
to get a girl to keep home for him. I was
assured, that it is not at all uncommon for a
lad of fifteen to be living with a girl of the
same age, as man and wife. It creates no
disgust among his class, but seems rather to
give him a position among such people. Their
courtship does not take long when once the
mate has been fixed upon. The girl is invited
to “raffles,” and treated to “twopenny hops,”
and half-pints of beer. Perhaps a silk neck
handkerchief&mdash;a “King’s-man” is given as
a present; though some of the lads will, when
the arrangement has been made, take the gift
back again and wear it themselves. The boys
are very jealous, and if once made angry behave
with great brutality to the offending girl. A
young fellow of about sixteen told me, as he
seemed to grow angry at the very thought,
“If I seed my gal a talking to another chap
I’d fetch her sich a punch of the nose as
should plaguy quick stop the whole business.”
Another lad informed me, with a knowing look,
“that the gals&mdash;it was a rum thing now he
come to think on it&mdash;axully liked a feller for
walloping them. As long as the bruises hurted,
she was always thinking on the cove as gived
’em her.” After a time, if the girl continues
faithful, the young coster may marry her; but
this is rarely the case, and many live with
their girls until they have grown to be men,
or perhaps they may quarrel the very first
year, and have a fight and part.</p>

<p>These boys hate any continuous work. So
strong is this objection to continuity that they
cannot even remain selling the same article for
more than a week together. Moreover none of
them can be got to keep stalls. They must be
perpetually on the move&mdash;or to use their own
words “they like a roving life.” They all
of them delight in dressing “flash” as they
call it. If a “governor” was to try and
“palm off” his old cord jacket upon the lad
that worked with him, the boy wouldn’t take
it. “Its too big and seedy for me,” he’d say,
“and I aint going to have your leavings.”
They try to dress like the men, with large
pockets in their cord jackets and plenty of
them. Their trowsers too must fit tight at the
knee, and their boots they like as good as possible.
A good “King’s-man,” a plush skull
cap, and a seam down the trowsers are the great
points of ambition with the coster boys.</p>

</div>

<p>A lad about fourteen informed me that “brass
buttons, like a huntman’s, with foxes’ heads on
em, looked stunning flash, and the gals liked
em.” As for the hair, they say it ought to be
long in front, and done in “figure-six” curls,
or twisted back to the ear “Newgate-knocker
style.” “But the worst of hair is,” they add,
“that it is always getting cut off in quod, all
along of muzzling the bobbies.”</p>

<p>The whole of the coster-boys are fond of
good living. I was told that when a lad started
<span class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for himself, he would for the first week or so
live almost entirely on cakes and nuts. When
settled in business they always manage to have
what they call “a relish” for breakfast and
tea, “a couple of herrings, or a bit of bacon, or
what not.” Many of them never dine excepting
on the Sunday&mdash;the pony and donkey proprietors
being the only costers whose incomes
will permit them to indulge in a “fourpenny
plate of meat at a cook’s shop.” The whole
of the boys too are extremely fond of pudding,
and should the “plum duff” at an eating-house
contain an unusual quantity of plums,
the news soon spreads, and the boys then
endeavour to work that way so as to obtain
a slice. While waiting for a market, the lads
will very often spend a shilling in the cakes
and three cornered puffs sold by the Jews.
The owners toss for them, and so enable the
young coster to indulge his two favourite
passions at the same time&mdash;his love of pastry,
and his love of gambling. The Jews crisp
butter biscuits also rank very high with the
boys, who declare that they “slip down like
soapsuds down a gully hole.” In fact it is
curious to notice how perfectly unrestrained
are the passions and appetites of these youths.
The only thoughts that trouble them are for
their girls, their eating and their gambling&mdash;beyond
the love of self they have no tie that
binds them to existence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Life of a Coster-Lad.</span></h3>

<p>One lad that I spoke to gave me as much of
his history as he could remember. He was a
tall stout boy, about sixteen years old, with a
face utterly vacant. His two heavy lead-coloured
eyes stared unmeaningly at me, and,
beyond a constant anxiety to keep his front
lock curled on his cheek, he did not exhibit the
slightest trace of feeling. He sank into his
seat heavily and of a heap, and when once
settled down he remained motionless, with his
mouth open and his hands on his knees&mdash;almost
as if paralyzed. He was dressed in all the slang
beauty of his class, with a bright red handkerchief
and unexceptionable boots.</p>

<p>“My father” he told me in a thick unimpassioned
voice, “was a waggoner, and worked
the country roads. There was two on us at
home with mother, and we used to play along
with the boys of our court, in Golding-lane, at
buttons and marbles. I recollects nothing more
than this&mdash;only the big boys used to cheat like
bricks and thump us if we grumbled&mdash;that’s
all I recollects of my infancy, as you calls it.
Father I’ve heard tell died when I was three
and brother only a year old. It was worse luck
for us!&mdash;Mother was so easy with us. I once
went to school for a couple of weeks, but the
cove used to fetch me a wipe over the knuckles
with his stick, and as I wasn’t going to stand
that there, why you see I aint no great schollard.
We did as we liked with mother, she
was so precious easy, and I never learned anything
but playing buttons and making leaden
‘bonces,’ that’s all,” (here the youth laughed
slightly.) “Mother used to be up and out very
early washing in families&mdash;anything for a
living. She was a good mother to us. We
was left at home with the key of the room and
some bread and butter for dinner. Afore she
got into work&mdash;and it was a goodish long time&mdash;we
was shocking hard up, and she pawned nigh
everything. Sometimes, when we had’nt no
grub at all, the other lads, perhaps, would give
us some of their bread and butter, but often our
stomachs used to ache with the hunger, and we
would cry when we was werry far gone. She
used to be at work from six in the morning till
ten o’clock at night, which was a long time for
a child’s belly to hold out again, and when it
was dark we would go and lie down on the bed
and try and sleep until she came home with the
food. I was eight year old then.</p>

<p>“A man as know’d mother, said to her, ‘Your
boy’s got nothing to do, let him come along with
me and yarn a few ha’pence,’ and so I became
a coster. He gave me 4<i>d.</i> a morning and my
breakfast. I worked with him about three
year, until I learnt the markets, and then I and
brother got baskets of our own, and used to
keep mother. One day with another, the two
on us together could make 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> by selling
greens of a morning, and going round to the
publics with nuts of a evening, till about ten
o’clock at night. Mother used to have a bit
of fried meat or a stew ready for us when we
got home, and by using up the stock as we
couldn’t sell, we used to manage pretty tidy.
When I was fourteen I took up with a girl.
She lived in the same house as we did, and I
used to walk out of a night with her and give
her half-pints of beer at the publics. She were
about thirteen, and used to dress werry nice,
though she weren’t above middling pretty.
Now I’m working for another man as gives me
a shilling a week, victuals, washing, and lodging,
just as if I was one of the family.</p>

<p>“On a Sunday I goes out selling, and all I
yarns I keeps. As for going to church, why, I
can’t afford it,&mdash;besides, to tell the truth, I
don’t like it well enough. Plays, too, ain’t in
my line much; I’d sooner go to a dance&mdash;its
more livelier. The ‘penny gaffs’ is rather more
in my style; the songs are out and out, and
makes our gals laugh. The smuttier the better,
I thinks; bless you! the gals likes it as much
as we do. If we lads ever has a quarrel, why,
we fights for it. If I was to let a cove off once,
he’d do it again; but I never give a lad a
chance, so long as I can get anigh him. I
never heard about Christianity; but if a cove
was to fetch me a lick of the head, I’d give it
him again, whether he was a big ’un or a little
’un. I’d precious soon see a henemy of mine
shot afore I’d forgive him,&mdash;where’s the use?
Do I understand what behaving to your neighbour
is?&mdash;In coorse I do. If a feller as lives
next me wanted a basket of mine as I wasn’t
using, why, he might have it; if I was working
it though, I’d see him further! I can under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>stand
that all as lives in a court is neighbours;
but as for policemen, they’re nothing to me,
and I should like to pay ’em all off well. No;
I never heerd about this here creation you
speaks about. In coorse God Almighty made
the world, and the poor bricklayers’ labourers
built the houses arterwards&mdash;that’s <i>my</i> opinion;
but I can’t say, for I’ve never been in no
schools, only always hard at work, and knows
nothing about it. I have heerd a little about
our Saviour,&mdash;they seem to say he were a
goodish kind of a man; but if he says as how
a cove’s to forgive a feller as hits you, I should
say he know’d nothing about it. In coorse the
gals the lads goes and lives with thinks our
walloping ’em wery cruel of us, but we don’t.
Why don’t we?&mdash;why, because we don’t.
Before father died, I used sometimes to say
my prayers, but after that mother was too busy
getting a living to mind about my praying.
Yes, I knows!&mdash;in the Lord’s prayer they says,
‘Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgives them
as trespasses agin us.’ It’s a very good thing,
in coorse, but no costers can’t do it.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Penny Gaff.”</span></h3>

<p>In many of the thoroughfares of London there
are shops which have been turned into a kind of
temporary theatre (admission one penny), where
dancing and singing take place every night.
Rude pictures of the performers are arranged
outside, to give the front a gaudy and attractive
look, and at night-time coloured lamps and
transparencies are displayed to draw an audience.
These places are called by the costers
“Penny Gaffs;” and on a Monday night as
many as six performances will take place, each
one having its two hundred visitors.</p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate the ignorance
and immorality of so numerous a class as that
of the costermongers, without wishing to discover
the cause of their degradation. Let any one
curious on this point visit one of these penny
shows, and he will wonder that <i>any</i> trace of
virtue and honesty should remain among the
people. Here the stage, instead of being the
means for illustrating a moral precept, is turned
into a platform to teach the cruelest debauchery.
The audience is usually composed of children so
young, that these dens become the school-rooms
where the guiding morals of a life are picked
up; and so precocious are the little things, that
the girl of nine will, from constant attendance at
such places, have learnt to understand the filthiest
sayings, and laugh at them as loudly as the
grown-up lads around her. What notions can
the young female form of marriage and chastity,
when the penny theatre rings with applause at
the performance of a scene whose sole point
turns upon the pantomimic imitation of the unrestrained
indulgence of the most corrupt appetites
of our nature? How can the lad learn to
check his hot passions and think honesty and
virtue admirable, when the shouts around him
impart a glory to a descriptive song so painfully
corrupt, that it can only have been made tolerable
by the most habitual excess? The men
who preside over these infamous places know
too well the failings of their audiences. They
know that these poor children require no nicely-turned
joke to make the evening pass merrily,
and that the filth they utter needs no double
meaning to veil its obscenity. The show that
will provide the most unrestrained debauchery
will have the most crowded benches; and to
gain this point, things are acted and spoken
that it is criminal even to allude to.</p>

<p>Not wishing to believe in the description
which some of the more intelligent of the costermongers
had given of these places, it was
thought better to visit one of them, so that all
exaggeration might be avoided. One of the
least offensive of the exhibitions was fixed upon.</p>

<p>The “penny gaff” chosen was situated in a
broad street near Smithfield; and for a great
distance off, the jingling sound of music was
heard, and the gas-light streamed out into the
thick night air as from a dark lantern, glittering
on the windows of the houses opposite, and
lighting up the faces of the mob in the road,
as on an illumination night. The front of a
large shop had been entirely removed, and the
entrance was decorated with paintings of the
“comic singers,” in their most “humourous”
attitudes. On a table against the wall was
perched the band, playing what the costers call
“dancing tunes” with great effect, for the hole
at the money-taker’s box was blocked up with
hands tendering the penny. The crowd without
was so numerous, that a policeman was in
attendance to preserve order, and push the boys
off the pavement&mdash;the music having the effect of
drawing them insensibly towards the festooned
green-baize curtain.</p>

<p>The shop itself had been turned into a
waiting-room, and was crowded even to the top
of the stairs leading to the gallery on the first
floor. The ceiling of this “lobby” was painted
blue, and spotted with whitewash clouds, to represent
the heavens; the boards of the trap-door,
and the laths that showed through the
holes in the plaster, being all of the same
colour. A notice was here posted, over the
canvass door leading into the theatre, to the
effect that “<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen to the
front places must pay Twopence</span>.”</p>

<p>The visitors, with a few exceptions, were all
boys and girls, whose ages seemed to vary from
eight to twenty years. Some of the girls&mdash;though
their figures showed them to be mere children&mdash;were
dressed in showy cotton-velvet polkas, and
wore dowdy feathers in their crushed bonnets.
They stood laughing and joking with the lads,
in an unconcerned, impudent manner, that was
almost appalling. Some of them, when tired
of waiting, chose their partners, and commenced
dancing grotesquely, to the admiration of the
lookers-on, who expressed their approbation in
obscene terms, that, far from disgusting the
poor little women, were received as compliments,
and acknowledged with smiles and coarse repartees.
The boys clustered together, smoking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pipes, and laughing at each other’s anecdotes,
or else jingling halfpence in time with the tune,
while they whistled an accompaniment to it.
Presently one of the performers, with a gilt
crown on his well greased locks, descended
from the staircase, his fleshings covered by a
dingy dressing-gown, and mixed with the mob,
shaking hands with old acquaintances. The
“comic singer,” too, made his appearance among
the throng&mdash;the huge bow to his cravat, which
nearly covered his waistcoat, and the red end to
his nose, exciting neither merriment nor surprise.</p>

<p>To discover the kind of entertainment, a lad
near me and my companion was asked “if
there was any flash dancing.” With a knowing
wink the boy answered, “Lots! show their legs
and all, prime!” and immediately the boy followed
up his information by a request for a
“yennep” to get a “tib of occabot.” After waiting
in the lobby some considerable time, the
performance inside was concluded, and the audience
came pouring out through the canvass
door. As they had to pass singly, I noticed
them particularly. Above three-fourths of
them were women and girls, the rest consisting
chiefly of mere boys&mdash;for out of about two
hundred persons I counted only eighteen men.
Forward they came, bringing an overpowering
stench with them, laughing and yelling as
they pushed their way through the waiting-room.
One woman carrying a sickly child
with a bulging forehead, was reeling drunk, the
saliva running down her mouth as she stared
about her with a heavy fixed eye. Two boys
were pushing her from side to side, while the
poor infant slept, breathing heavily, as if stupified,
through the din. Lads jumping on girls’
shoulders, and girls laughing hysterically from
being tickled by the youths behind them, every
one shouting and jumping, presented a mad
scene of frightful enjoyment.</p>

<p>When these had left, a rush for places by
those in waiting began, that set at defiance the
blows and strugglings of a lady in spangles
who endeavoured to preserve order and take the
checks. As time was a great object with the
proprietor, the entertainment within began
directly the first seat was taken, so that the
lads without, rendered furious by the rattling
of the piano within, made the canvass partition
bulge in and out, with the strugglings of those
seeking admission, like a sail in a flagging
wind.</p>

<p>To form the theatre, the first floor had been
removed; the whitewashed beams however
still stretched from wall to wall. The lower
room had evidently been the warehouse, while
the upper apartment had been the sitting-room,
for the paper was still on the walls. A gallery,
with a canvass front, had been hurriedly built
up, and it was so fragile that the boards bent
under the weight of those above. The bricks
in the warehouse were smeared over with red
paint, and had a few black curtains daubed
upon them. The coster-youths require no very
great scenic embellishment, and indeed the
stage&mdash;which was about eight feet square&mdash;could
admit of none. Two jets of gas, like
those outside a butcher’s shop, were placed on
each side of the proscenium, and proved very
handy for the gentlemen whose pipes required
lighting. The band inside the “theatre”
could not compare with the band without.
An old grand piano, whose canvass-covered
top extended the entire length of the stage,
sent forth its wiry notes under the be-ringed
fingers of a “professor Wilkinsini,” while another
professional, with his head resting on his
violin, played vigorously, as he stared unconcernedly
at the noisy audience.</p>

<p>Singing and dancing formed the whole of the
hours’ performance, and, of the two, the singing
was preferred. A young girl, of about fourteen
years of age, danced with more energy than
grace, and seemed to be well-known to the
spectators, who cheered her on by her Christian
name. When the dance was concluded, the
proprietor of the establishment threw down a
penny from the gallery, in the hopes that
others might be moved to similar acts of
generosity; but no one followed up the offering,
so the young lady hunted after the
money and departed. The “comic singer,” in
a battered hat and the huge bow to his cravat,
was received with deafening shouts. Several
songs were named by the costers, but the
“funny gentleman” merely requested them “to
hold their jaws,” and putting on a “knowing”
look, sang a song, the whole point of which
consisted in the mere utterance of some filthy
word at the end of each stanza. Nothing, however,
could have been more successful. The
lads stamped their feet with delight; the girls
screamed with enjoyment. Once or twice a
young shrill laugh would anticipate the fun&mdash;as
if the words were well known&mdash;or the boys would
forestall the point by shouting it out before the
proper time. When the song was ended the
house was in a delirium of applause. The
canvass front to the gallery was beaten with
sticks, drum-like, and sent down showers of
white powder on the heads in the pit. Another
song followed, and the actor knowing on what
his success depended, lost no opportunity of increasing
his laurels. The most obscene thoughts,
the most disgusting scenes were coolly described,
making a poor child near me wipe away the
tears that rolled down her eyes with the enjoyment
of the poison. There were three or four of
these songs sung in the course of the evening,
each one being encored, and then changed.
One written about “Pine-apple rock,” was the
grand treat of the night, and offered greater
scope to the rhyming powers of the author
than any of the others. In this, not a single
chance had been missed; ingenuity had been
exerted to its utmost lest an obscene thought
should be passed by, and it was absolutely
awful to behold the relish with which the
young ones jumped to the hideous meaning of
the verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one scene yet to come, that was
perfect in its wickedness. A ballet began between
a man dressed up as a woman, and a
country clown. The most disgusting attitudes
were struck, the most immoral acts represented,
without one dissenting voice. If there had been
any feat of agility, any grimacing, or, in fact,
anything with which the laughter of the uneducated
classes is usually associated, the applause
might have been accounted for; but here were
two ruffians degrading themselves each time
they stirred a limb, and forcing into the brains
of the childish audience before them thoughts
that must embitter a lifetime, and descend from
father to child like some bodily infirmity.</p>

<p>When I had left, I spoke to a better class
costermonger on this saddening subject. “Well,
sir, it is frightful,” he said, “but the boys <i>will</i>
have their amusements. If their amusements is
bad they don’t care; they only wants to laugh,
and this here kind of work does it. Give ’em
better singing and better dancing, and they’d go,
if the price was as cheap as this is. I’ve seen,
when a decent concert was given at a penny, as
many as four thousand costers present, behaving
themselves as quietly and decently as possible.
Their wives and children was with ’em, and no
audience was better conducted. It’s all stuff
talking about them preferring this sort of thing.
Give ’em good things at the same price, and I
<i>know</i> they will like the good, better than the
bad.”</p>

<p>My own experience with this neglected class
goes to prove, that if we would really lift them
out of the moral mire in which they are wallowing,
the first step must be to provide them with
<i>wholesome</i> amusements. The misfortune, however,
is, that when we seek to elevate the character
of the people, we give them such mere
dry abstract truths and dogmas to digest, that
the uneducated mind turns with abhorrence from
them. We forget how we ourselves were originally
won by our <i>emotions</i> to the consideration
of such subjects. We do not remember how our
own tastes have been formed, nor do we, in our
zeal, stay to reflect how the tastes of a people
generally are created; and, consequently, we
cannot perceive that a habit of enjoying any
matter whatsoever can only be induced in the
mind by linking with it some æsthetic affection.
The heart is the mainspring of the intellect, and
the feelings the real educers and educators of the
thoughts. As games with the young destroy the
fatigue of muscular exercise, so do the sympathies
stir the mind to action without any sense
of effort. It is because “serious” people generally
object to enlist the emotions in the education
of the poor, and look upon the delight which
arises in the mind from the mere perception of
the beauty of sound, motion, form, and colour&mdash;or
from the apt association of harmonious or
incongruous ideas&mdash;or from the sympathetic
operation of the affections; it is because, I say,
the zealous portion of society look upon these
matters as “<i>vanity</i>,” that the amusements of the
working-classes are left to venal traders to provide.
Hence, in the low-priced entertainments
which necessarily appeal to the poorer, and,
therefore, to the least educated of the people,
the proprietors, instead of trying to develop in
them the purer sources of delight, seek only to
gratify their audience in the coarsest manner, by
appealing to their most brutal appetites. And
thus the emotions, which the great Architect of
the human mind gave us as the means of quickening
our imaginations and refining our sentiments,
are made the instruments of crushing
every operation of the intellect and debasing our
natures. It is idle and unfeeling to believe that
the great majority of a people whose days are
passed in excessive toil, and whose homes are
mostly of an uninviting character, will forego <i>all</i>
amusements, and consent to pass their evenings
by their <i>no</i> firesides, reading tracts or singing
hymns. It is folly to fancy that the mind, spent
with the irksomeness of compelled labour, and
depressed, perhaps, with the struggle to live by
that labour after all, will not, when the work is
over, seek out some place where at least it can
forget its troubles or fatigues in the temporary
pleasure begotten by some mental or physical
stimulant. It is because we exact too much of
the poor&mdash;because we, as it were, strive to make
true knowledge and true beauty as forbidding as
possible to the uneducated and unrefined, that
they fly to their penny gaffs, their twopenny-hops,
their beer-shops, and their gambling-grounds
for pleasures which we deny them, and
which we, in our arrogance, believe it is possible
for them to do without.</p>

<p>The experiment so successfully tried at
Liverpool of furnishing music of an enlivening
and yet elevating character at the same price as
the concerts of the lowest grade, shows that the
people may be won to delight in beauty instead
of beastiality, and teaches us again that it is <i>our</i>
fault to allow them to be as they are and not
their’s to remain so. All men are compound
animals, with many inlets of pleasure to their
brains, and if one avenue be closed against
them, why it but forces them to seek delight
through another. So far from the perception of
beauty inducing habits of gross enjoyment as
“serious” people generally imagine, a moment’s
reflection will tell us that these very
habits are only the necessary consequences of
the non-development of the æsthetic faculty;
for the two assuredly cannot co-exist. To cultivate
the sense of the beautiful is necessarily to
inculcate a detestation of the sensual. Moreover,
it is impossible for the mind to be accustomed to
the contemplation of what is admirable without
continually mounting to higher and higher
forms of it&mdash;from the beauty of nature to that
of thought&mdash;from thought to feeling, from
feeling to action, and lastly to the fountain of
all goodness&mdash;the great munificent Creator of
the sea, the mountains, and the flowers&mdash;the
stars, the sunshine, and the rainbow&mdash;the fancy,
the reason, the love and the heroism of man and
womankind&mdash;the instincts of the beasts&mdash;the
glory of the angels&mdash;and the mercy of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Coster-Girls.</span></h3>

<p>The costermongers, taken as a body, entertain
the most imperfect idea of the sanctity of marriage.
To their undeveloped minds it merely
consists in the fact of a man and woman living
together, and sharing the gains they may each
earn by selling in the street. The father and
mother of the girl look upon it as a convenient
means of shifting the support of their child over
to another’s exertions; and so thoroughly do
they believe this to be the end and aim of
matrimony, that the expense of a church ceremony
is considered as a useless waste of money,
and the new pair are received by their companions
as cordially as if every form of law and
religion had been complied with.</p>

<p>The notions of morality among these people
agree strangely, as I have said, with those of
many savage tribes&mdash;indeed, it would be curious
if it were otherwise. They are a part of the
Nomades of England, neither knowing nor caring
for the enjoyments of home. The hearth, which
is so sacred a symbol to all civilized races as
being the spot where the virtues of each succeeding
generation are taught and encouraged,
has no charms to them. The tap-room is the
father’s chief abiding place; whilst to the
mother the house is only a better kind of <i>tent</i>.
She is away at the stall, or hawking her goods
from morning till night, while the children are
left to play away the day in the court or alley,
and pick their morals out of the gutter. So
long as the limbs gain strength the parent cares
for nothing else. As the young ones grow up,
their only notions of wrong are formed by what
the policeman will permit them to do. If we,
who have known from babyhood the kindly
influences of a home, require, before we are
thrust out into the world to get a living for ourselves,
that our perceptions of good and evil
should be quickened and brightened (the same
as our perceptions of truth and falsity) by the
experience and counsel of those who are wiser
and better than ourselves,&mdash;if, indeed, it needed
a special creation and example to teach the best
and strongest of us the law of right, how bitterly
must the children of the street-folk require tuition,
training, and advice, when from their very
cradles (if, indeed, they ever knew such luxuries)
they are doomed to witness in their parents,
whom they naturally believe to be their superiors,
habits of life in which passion is the sole
rule of action, and where every appetite of our
animal nature is indulged in without the least
restraint.</p>

<p>I say thus much because I am anxious to
make others feel, as I do myself, that <i>we</i> are
the culpable parties in these matters. That
they poor things should do as they do is but
human nature&mdash;but that <i>we</i> should allow them
to remain thus destitute of every blessing
vouchsafed to ourselves&mdash;that we should willingly
share what we enjoy with our brethren
at the Antipodes, and yet leave those who are
nearer and who, therefore, should be dearer to
us, to want even the commonest moral necessaries
is a paradox that gives to the zeal of our
Christianity a strong savour of the chicanery of
Cant.</p>

<p>The costermongers strongly resemble the
North American Indians in their conduct to
their wives. They can understand that it is the
duty of the woman to contribute to the happiness
of the man, but cannot feel that there is a
reciprocal duty from the man to the woman.
The wife is considered as an inexpensive servant,
and the disobedience of a wish is punished with
blows. She must work early and late, and to
the husband must be given the proceeds of her
labour. Often when the man is in one of his
drunken fits&mdash;which sometimes last two or three
days continuously&mdash;she must by her sole exertions
find food for herself and him too. To
live in peace with him, there must be no murmuring,
no tiring under work, no fancied cause
for jealousy&mdash;for if there be, she is either beaten
into submission or cast adrift to begin life again&mdash;as
another’s leavings.</p>

<p>The story of one coster girl’s life may be taken
as a type of the many. When quite young she
is placed out to nurse with some neighbour,
the mother&mdash;if a fond one&mdash;visiting the child at
certain periods of the day, for the purpose of
feeding it, or sometimes, knowing the round she
has to make, having the infant brought to her
at certain places, to be “suckled.” As soon as
it is old enough to go alone, the court is its
play-ground, the gutter its school-room, and
under the care of an elder sister the little one
passes the day, among children whose mothers
like her own are too busy out in the streets helping
to get the food, to be able to mind the family
at home. When the girl is strong enough, she
in her turn is made to assist the mother by
keeping guard over the younger children, or, if
there be none, she is lent out to carry about a
baby, and so made to add to the family income
by gaining her sixpence weekly. Her time is
from the earliest years fully occupied; indeed,
her parents cannot afford to keep her without
doing and getting <i>something</i>. Very few of the
children receive the least education. “The
parents,” I am told, “never give their minds to
learning, for they say, ‘What’s the use of it?
<i>that</i> won’t yarn a gal a living.’” Everything is
sacrificed&mdash;as, indeed, under the circumstances
it must be&mdash;in the struggle to live&mdash;aye! and to
live <i>merely</i>. Mind, heart, soul, are all absorbed
in the belly. The rudest form of animal life,
physiologists tell us, is simply a locomotive
stomach. Verily, it would appear as if our
social state had a tendency to make the highest
animal sink into the lowest.</p>

<p>At about seven years of age the girls first go
into the streets to sell. A shallow-basket is
given to them, with about two shillings for stock-money,
and they hawk, according to the time of
year, either oranges, apples, or violets; some
begin their street education with the sale of
water-cresses. The money earned by this means
is strictly given to the parents. Sometimes&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
rarely&mdash;a girl who has been unfortunate
during the day will not dare to return home at
night, and then she will sleep under some dry
arch or about some market, until the morrow’s
gains shall ensure her a safe reception and
shelter in her father’s room.</p>

<p>The life of the coster-girls is as severe as that
of the boys. Between four and five in the
morning they have to leave home for the markets,
and sell in the streets until about nine.
Those that have more kindly parents, return then
to breakfast, but many are obliged to earn the
morning’s meal for themselves. After breakfast,
they generally remain in the streets until
about ten o’clock at night; many having nothing
during all that time but one meal of bread and
butter and coffee, to enable them to support the
fatigue of walking from street to street with
the heavy basket on their heads. In the course
of a day, some girls eat as much as a pound of
bread, and very seldom get any meat, unless it
be on a Sunday.</p>

<p>There are many poor families that, without
the aid of these girls, would be forced into the
workhouse. They are generally of an affectionate
disposition, and some will perform acts of
marvellous heroism to keep together the little
home. It is not at all unusual for mere children
of fifteen to walk their eight or ten miles
a day, carrying a basket of nearly two hundred
weight on their heads. A journey to Woolwich
and back, or to the towns near London, is often
undertaken to earn the 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> their parents are
anxiously waiting for at home.</p>

<p>Very few of these girls are married to the
men they afterwards live with. Their courtship
is usually a very short one; for, as one told me,
“the life is such a hard one, that a girl is ready
to get rid of a <i>little</i> of the labour at any price.”
The coster-lads see the girls at market, and if
one of them be pretty, and a boy take a fancy
to her, he will make her bargains for her, and
carry her basket home. Sometimes a coster
working his rounds will feel a liking for a wench
selling her goods in the street, and will leave
his barrow to go and talk with her. A girl
seldom takes up with a lad before she is sixteen,
though some of them, when barely fifteen or
even fourteen, will pair off. They court for a
time, going to raffles and “gaffs” together, and
then the affair is arranged. The girl tells her
parents “she’s going to keep company with
so-and-so,” packs up what things she has, and
goes at once, without a word of remonstrance
from either father or mother. A furnished
room, at about 4<i>s.</i> a week is taken, and the
young couple begin life. The lad goes out as
usual with his barrow, and the girl goes out
with her basket, often working harder for her
lover than she had done for her parents. They
go to market together, and at about nine o’clock
her day’s selling begins. Very often she will
take out with her in the morning what food she
requires during the day, and never return home
until eleven o’clock at night.</p>

<p>The men generally behave very cruelly to
the girls they live with. They are as faithful
to them as if they were married, but they are
jealous in the extreme. To see a man talking
to their girl is sufficient to ensure the poor
thing a beating. They sometimes ill-treat
them horribly&mdash;most unmercifully indeed&mdash;nevertheless
the girls say they cannot help
loving them still, and continue working for
them, as if they experienced only kindness at
their hands. Some of the men are gentler and
more considerate in their treatment of them,
but by far the larger portion are harsh and
merciless. Often when the Saturday night’s
earnings of the two have been large, the man
will take the entire money, and as soon as the
Sunday’s dinner is over, commence drinking
hard, and continue drunk for two or three days
together, until the funds are entirely exhausted.
The women never gamble; they say, “it gives
them no excitement.” They prefer, if they
have a spare moment in the evening, sitting
near the fire making up and patching their
clothes. “Ah, sir,” said a girl to me, “a neat
gown does a deal with a man; he always likes
a girl best when everybody else likes her too.”
On a Sunday they clean their room for the
week and go for a treat, if they can persuade
their young man to take them out in the afternoon,
either to Chalk Farm or Battersea Fields&mdash;“where
there’s plenty of life.”</p>

<p>After a girl has once grown accustomed to a
street-life, it is almost impossible to wean her
from it. The muscular irritability begotten by
continued wandering makes her unable to rest
for any time in one place, and she soon, if put
to any <i>settled</i> occupation, gets to crave for the
severe exercise she formerly enjoyed. The
least restraint will make her sigh after the
perfect liberty of the coster’s “roving life.” As
an instance of this I may relate a fact that
has occurred within the last six months. A
gentleman of high literary repute, struck with
the heroic strugglings of a coster Irish girl to
maintain her mother, took her to his house,
with a view of teaching her the duties of a
servant. At first the transition was a painful
one to the poor thing. Having travelled barefoot
through the streets since a mere child, the
pressure of shoes was intolerable to her, and in
the evening or whenever a few minutes’ rest
could be obtained, the boots were taken off, for
with them on she could enjoy no ease. The
perfect change of life, and the novelty of being
in a new place, reconciled her for some time to
the loss of her liberty. But no sooner did she
hear from her friends, that sprats were again
in the market, than, as if there were some
magical influence in the fish, she at once
requested to be freed from the confinement, and
permitted to return to her old calling.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the lower class of girls,
though this lower class, I regret to say, constitutes
by far the greater portion of the whole.
Still I would not for a moment have it inferred
that <i>all</i> are bad. There are many young girls
getting their living, or rather helping to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the living of others in the streets, whose goodness,
considering the temptations and hardships
besetting such an occupation, approximates to
the marvellous. As a type of the more prudent
class of coster girls, I would cite the
following narrative received from the lips of
a young woman in answer to a series of
questions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Life of a Coster Girl.</span></h3>

<p>I wished to have obtained a statement from
the girl whose portrait is here given, but she
was afraid to give the slightest information
about the habits of her companions, lest they
should recognize her by the engraving and persecute
her for the revelations she might make.
After disappointing me some dozen times, I was
forced to seek out some other coster girl.</p>

<p>The one I fixed upon was a fine-grown young
woman of eighteen. She had a habit of curtsying
to every question that was put to her. Her plaid
shawl was tied over the breast, and her cotton-velvet
bonnet was crushed in with carrying her
basket. She seemed dreadfully puzzled where
to put her hands, at one time tucking them
under her shawl, warming them at the fire, or
measuring the length of her apron, and when
she answered a question she invariably addressed
the fireplace. Her voice was husky from shouting
apples.</p>

<p>“My mother has been in the streets selling all
her lifetime. Her uncle learnt her the markets
and she learnt me. When business grew bad
she said to me, ‘Now you shall take care on the
stall, and I’ll go and work out charing.’ The
way she learnt me the markets was to judge of
the weight of the baskets of apples, and then
said she, ‘Always bate ’em down, a’most a
half.’ I always liked the street-life very well,
that was if I was selling. I have mostly kept a
stall myself, but I’ve known gals as walk about
with apples, as have told me that the weight of
the baskets is sich that the neck cricks, and
when the load is took off, its just as if you’d a
stiff neck, and the head feels as light as a
feather. The gals begins working very early at
our work; the parents makes them go out when
a’most babies. There’s a little gal, I’m sure
she an’t more than half-past seven, that stands
selling water-cresses next my stall, and mother
was saying, ‘Only look there, how that little
one has to get her living afore she a’most knows
what a penn’orth means.’</p>

<p>“There’s six on us in family, and father and
mother makes eight. Father used to do odd jobs
with the gas-pipes in the streets, and when
work was slack we had very hard times of it.
Mother always liked being with us at home,
and used to manage to keep us employed out of
mischief&mdash;she’d give us an old gown to make
into pinafores for the children and such like!
She’s been very good to us, has mother, and
so’s father. She always liked to hear us read
to her whilst she was washing or such like! and
then we big ones had to learn the little ones.
But when father’s work got slack, if she had no
employment charing, she’d say, ‘Now I’ll go
and buy a bushel of apples,’ and then she’d
turn out and get a penny that way. I suppose
by sitting at the stall from nine in the morning
till the shops shuts up&mdash;say ten o’clock at night,
I can earn about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day. It’s all according
to the apples&mdash;whether they’re good or not&mdash;what
we makes. If I’m unlucky, mother will
say, ‘Well, I’ll go out to-morrow and see what
<i>I</i> can do;’ and if I’ve done well, she’ll say ‘Come
you’re a good hand at it; you’ve done famous.’
Yes, mother’s very fair that way. Ah! there’s
many a gal I knows whose back has to suffer
if she don’t sell her stock well; but, thank God!
I never get more than a blowing up. My
parents is very fair to me.</p>

<p>“I dare say there ain’t ten out of a hundred
gals what’s living with men, what’s been married
Church of England fashion. I know plenty
myself, but I don’t, indeed, think it right. It
seems to me that the gals is fools to be ’ticed
away, but, in coorse, they needn’t go without
they likes. This is why I don’t think it’s right.
Perhaps a man will have a few words with his
gal, and he’ll say, ‘Oh! I ain’t obligated to keep
her!’ and he’ll turn her out: and then where’s
that poor gal to go? Now, there’s a gal I knows
as came to me no later than this here week, and
she had a dreadful swole face and a awful black
eye; and I says, ‘Who’s done that?’ and she says,
says she, ‘Why, Jack’&mdash;just in that way; and then
she says, says she, ‘I’m going to take a warrant
out to-morrow.’ Well, he gets the warrant that
same night, but she never appears again him, for
fear of getting more beating. That don’t seem to
me to be like married people ought to be. Besides,
if parties is married, they ought to bend to
each other; and they won’t, for sartain, if they’re
only living together. A man as is married is
obligated to keep his wife if they quarrels or not;
and he says to himself, says he, ‘Well, I may
as well live happy, like.’ But if he can turn a
poor gal off, as soon as he tires of her, he begins
to have noises with her, and then gets quit of
her altogether. Again, the men takes the money
of the gals, and in coorse ought to treat ’em well&mdash;which
they don’t. This is another reason: when
the gal is in the family way, the lads mostly
sends them to the workhouse to lay in, and only
goes sometimes to take them a bit of tea and
shuggar; but, in coorse, married men wouldn’t
behave in such likes to their poor wives. After
a quarrel, too, a lad goes and takes up with
another young gal, and that isn’t pleasant for
the first one. The first step to ruin is them
places of ‘penny gaffs,’ for they hears things
there as oughtn’t to be said to young gals.
Besides, the lads is very insinivating, and after
leaving them places will give a gal a drop of
beer, and make her half tipsy, and then they
makes their arrangements. I’ve often heerd
the boys boasting of having ruined gals, for all
the world as if they was the first noblemen in
the land.</p>

<p>“It would be a good thing if these sort of
goings on could be stopped. It’s half the pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>rents’
fault; for if a gal can’t get a living, they
turns her out into the streets, and then what’s to
become of her? I’m sure the gals, if they was
married, would be happier, because they couldn’t
be beat worse. And if they was married, they’d
get a nice home about ’em; whereas, if they’s
only living together, they takes a furnished room.
I’m sure, too, that it’s a bad plan; for I’ve
heerd the gals themselves say, ‘Ah! I wish I’d
never seed Jack’ (or Tom, or whatever it is);
‘I’m sure I’d never be half so bad but for
him.’</p>

<p>“Only last night father was talking about
religion. We often talks about religion. Father
has told me that God made the world, and I’ve
heerd him talk about the first man and woman
as was made and lived&mdash;it must be more than a
hundred years ago&mdash;but I don’t like to speak
on what I don’t know. Father, too, has told
me about our Saviour what was nailed on a cross
to suffer for such poor people as we is. Father
has told us, too, about his giving a great many
poor people a penny loaf and a bit of fish each,
which proves him to have been a very kind gentleman.
The Ten Commandments was made by
him, I’ve heerd say, and he performed them too
among other miracles. Yes! this is part of
what our Saviour tells us. We are to forgive
everybody, and do nobody no injury. I don’t
think I could forgive an enemy if she injured
me very much; I’m sure I don’t know why
I couldn’t, unless it is that I’m poor, and never
learnt to do it. If a gal stole my shawl and
didn’t return it back or give me the value on it,
I couldn’t forgive her; but if she told me she
lost it off her back, I shouldn’t be so hard on
her. We poor gals ain’t very religious, but
we are better than the men. We all of us
thanks God for everything&mdash;even for a fine day;
as for sprats, we always says they’re God’s blessing
for the poor, and thinks it hard of the
Lord Mayor not to let ’em come in afore the
ninth of November, just because he wants to
dine off them&mdash;which he always do. Yes, we
knows for certain that they eats plenty of
sprats at the Lord Mayor’s ‘blanket.’ They
say in the Bible that the world was made in six
days: the beasts, the birds, the fish, and all&mdash;and
sprats was among them in coorse. There
was only one house at that time as was made,
and that was the Ark for Adam and Eve and
their family. It seems very wonderful indeed
how all this world was done so quick. I should
have thought that England alone would have
took double the time; shouldn’t you, sir? But
then it says in the Bible, God Almighty’s a just
and true God, and in coorse time would be nothing
to him. When a good person is dying, we says,
‘The Lord has called upon him, and he must
go,’ but I can’t think what it means, unless
it is that an angel comes&mdash;like when we’re
a-dreaming&mdash;and tells the party he’s wanted in
heaven. I know where heaven is; it’s above
the clouds, and they’re placed there to prevent
us seeing into it. That’s where all the good people
go, but I’m afeerd,”&mdash;she continued solemnly&mdash;“there’s
very few costers among the angels&mdash;’specially
those as deceives poor gals.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think this world could well go
on for ever. There’s a great deal of ground in
it, certainly, and it seems very strong at present;
but they say there’s to be a flood on the earth,
and earthquakes, and that will destroy it. The
earthquake ought to have took place some time
ago, as people tells me, but I never heerd any
more about it. If we cheats in the streets, I
know we shan’t go to Heaven; but it’s very
hard upon us, for if we didn’t cheat we couldn’t
live, profits is so bad. It’s the same with the
shops, and I suppose the young men there won’t
go to Heaven neither; but if people won’t give
the money, both costers and tradesmen must
cheat, and that’s very hard. Why, look at
apples! customers want them for less than
they cost us, and so we are forced to shove in
bad ones as well as good ones; and if we’re to
suffer for that, it does seem to me dreadful
cruel.”</p>

<p>Curious and extravagant as this statement
may perhaps appear to the uninitiated, nevertheless
it is here given as it was spoken; and it
was spoken with an earnestness that proved the
poor girl looked upon it as a subject, the solemnity
of which forced her to be truthful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Costermongers and Thieves.</span></h3>

<p>Concerning the connection of these two classes
I had the following account from a costermonger:
“I’ve known the coster trade for twelve years,
and never knew thieves go out a costering as a
cloak; they may have done so, but I very
much doubt it. Thieves go for an idle life, and
costermongering don’t suit them. Our chaps
don’t care a d&mdash;n who they associate with,&mdash;if
they’re thieves they meet ’em all the same, or
anything that way. But costers buy what they
call ‘a gift,’&mdash;may-be it’s a watch or coat wot’s
been stolen&mdash;from any that has it to sell. A
man will say: ‘If you’ve a few shillings, you
may make a good thing of it. Why this identical
watch is only twenty shillings, and it’s
worth fifty;’ so if the coster has money, he buys.
Thieves will get 3<i>d.</i> where a mechanic or a coster
will earn &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and the most ignorant of our
people has a queer sort of respect for thieves,
because of the money they make. Poverty’s as
much despised among costers as among other
people. People that’s badly off among us are
called ‘cursed.’ In bad weather it’s common
for costers to ‘curse themselves,’ as they call
having no trade. ‘Well, I’m cursed,’ they say
when they can make no money. It’s a common
thing among them to shout after any one they
don’t like, that’s reduced, ‘Well, ain’t you
cursed?’” The costers, I am credibly informed,
gamble a great deal with the wealthier class of
thieves, and win of them the greater part of the
money they get.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the more provident Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>Concerning this head, I give the statement of
a man whose information I found fully confirmed:&mdash;“We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
are not such a degraded set as
some believe; sir, but a living doesn’t tumble
into a man’s mouth, now a days. A good
many of us costers rises into greengrocers and
coal-sheds, and still carries on their rounds as
costers, all the same. Why, in Lock’s-fields,
I could show you twenty such, and you’d find
them very decent men, sir&mdash;very. There’s one
man I know, that’s risen that way, who is worth
hundreds of pounds, and keeps his horse and
cart like a gentleman. They rises to be voters,
and they all vote liberal. Some marry the better
kind of servants,&mdash;such servant-maids as
would’nt marry a rag and bottle shop, but
doesn’t object to a coal shed. It’s mostly
younger men that manages this. As far as I
have observed, these costers, after they has
settled and got to be housekeepers, don’t turn
their backs on their old mates. They’d have a
nice life of it if they did&mdash;yes! a very nice life.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Homes of the Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The costermongers usually reside in the courts
and alleys in the neighbourhood of the different
street-markets. They themselves designate the
locality where, so to speak, a colony of their
people has been established, a “coster district,”
and the entire metropolis is thus parcelled out,
almost as systematically as if for the purposes
of registration. These costermonger districts
are as follows, and are here placed in the order
of the numerical importance of the residents:</p>

<ul>
<li>The New Cut (Lambeth).</li>
<li>Whitecross-street.</li>
<li>Leather-lane.</li>
<li>The Brill, Somers’ Town.</li>
<li>Whitechapel.</li>
<li>Camberwell.</li>
<li>Walworth.</li>
<li>Peckham.</li>
<li>Bermondsey.</li>
<li>The Broadway, Westminster.</li>
<li>Shoreditch.</li>
<li>Paddington and Edgeware Road.</li>
<li>Tottenham-court Road.</li>
<li>Drury-lane.</li>
<li>Old-street Road.</li>
<li>Clare Market.</li>
<li>Ratcliffe Highway.</li>
<li>Lisson-grove.</li>
<li>Petticoat and Rosemary-lane.</li>
<li>Marylebone-lane.</li>
<li>Oxford-street.</li>
<li>Rotherhithe.</li>
<li>Deptford.</li>
<li>Dockhead.</li>
<li>Greenwich.</li>
<li>Commercial-road (East).</li>
<li>Poplar.</li>
<li>Limehouse.</li>
<li>Bethnal-green.</li>
<li>Hackney-road.</li>
<li>Kingsland.</li>
<li>Camden Town.</li>

</ul>

<p>The homes of the costermongers in these
places, may be divided into three classes; firstly,
those who, by having a regular trade or by prudent
economy, are enabled to live in comparative
ease and plenty; secondly, those who, from
having a large family or by imprudent expenditure,
are, as it were, struggling with the world;
and thirdly, those who for want of stock-money,
or ill success in trade are nearly destitute.</p>

<p>The first home I visited was that of an old
woman, who with the assistance of her son and
girls, contrived to live in a most praiseworthy
and comfortable manner. She and all her
family were teetotallers, and may be taken as a
fair type of the thriving costermonger.</p>

<p>As I ascended a dark flight of stairs, a savory
smell of stew grew stronger at each step I
mounted. The woman lived in a large airy
room on the first floor (“the drawing-room”
as she told me laughing at her own joke), well
lighted by a clean window, and I found her
laying out the savory smelling dinner looking
most temptingly clean. The floor was as white
as if it had been newly planed, the coke fire
was bright and warm, making the lid of the
tin saucepan on it rattle up and down as the
steam rushed out. The wall over the fire-place
was patched up to the ceiling with little square
pictures of saints, and on the mantel-piece,
between a row of bright tumblers and wine
glasses filled with odds and ends, stood glazed
crockeryware images of Prince Albert and M.
Jullien. Against the walls, which were papered
with “hangings” of four different patterns and
colours, were hung several warm shawls, and in
the band-box, which stood on the stained chest
of drawers, you could tell that the Sunday
bonnet was stowed safely away from the dust.
A turn-up bedstead thrown back, and covered
with a many-coloured patch-work quilt, stood
opposite to a long dresser with its mugs and
cups dangling from the hooks, and the clean
blue plates and dishes ranged in order at the
back. There were a few bushel baskets piled
up in one corner, “but the apples smelt so,” she
said, “they left them in a stable at night.”</p>

<p>By the fire sat the woman’s daughter, a
pretty meek-faced gray-eyed girl of sixteen,
who “was home nursing” for a cold. “Steve”
(her boy) I was informed, was out working.
With his help, the woman assured me, she could
live very comfortably&mdash;“God be praised!” and
when he got the barrow he was promised, she
gave me to understand, that their riches were to
increase past reckoning. Her girl too was to be
off at work as soon as sprats came in. “Its on
Lord Mayor’s-day they comes in,” said a neighbour
who had rushed up to see the strange
gentleman, “they says he has ’em on his table,
but I never seed ’em. They never gives us the
pieces, no not even the heads,” and every one
laughed to their utmost. The good old dame
was in high spirits, her dark eyes sparkling as
she spoke about her “Steve.” The daughter in
a little time lost her bashfulness, and informed
me “that one of the Polish refugees was
a-courting Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, who had given him a
pair of black eyes.”</p>

<p>On taking my leave I was told by the mother
that their silver gilt Dutch clock&mdash;with its glass
face and blackleaded weights&mdash;“was the best
one in London, and might be relied on with the
greatest safety.”</p>

<p>As a specimen of the dwellings of the struggling
costers, the following may be cited:</p>

<p>The man, a tall, thick-built, almost good-looking
fellow, with a large fur cap on his head,
lived with his family in a front kitchen, and
as there were, with his mother-in-law, five
persons, and only one bed, I was somewhat
puzzled to know where they could <i>all</i> sleep.
The barrow standing on the railings over the
window, half shut out the light, and when any
one passed there was a momentary shadow
thrown over the room, and a loud rattling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
iron gratings above that completely prevented
all conversation. When I entered, the mother-in-law
was reading aloud one of the threepenny
papers to her son, who lolled on the bed, that
with its curtains nearly filled the room. There
was the usual attempt to make the fireside comfortable.
The stone sides had been well whitened,
and the mantel-piece decorated with its small
tin trays, tumblers, and a piece of looking-glass.
A cat with a kitten were seated on the hearth-rug
in front. “They keeps the varmint away,”
said the woman, stroking the “puss,” “and
gives a look of home.” By the drawers were
piled up four bushel baskets, and in a dark
corner near the bed stood a tall measure full of
apples that scented the room. Over the head,
on a string that stretched from wall to wall,
dangled a couple of newly-washed shirts, and by
the window were two stone barrels, for lemonade,
when the coster visited the fairs and races.</p>

<p>Whilst we were talking, the man’s little
girl came home. For a poor man’s child she
was dressed to perfection; her pinafore was
clean, her face shone with soap, and her tidy
cotton print gown had clearly been newly put on
that morning. She brought news that “Janey”
was coming home from auntey’s, and instantly
a pink cotton dress was placed by the mother-in-law
before the fire to air. (It appeared that
Janey was out at service, and came home once
a week to see her parents and take back a clean
frock.) Although these people were living,
so to speak, in a cellar, still every endeavour
had been made to give the home a look of
comfort. The window, with its paper-patched
panes, had a clean calico blind. The side-table
was dressed up with yellow jugs and cups and
saucers, and the band-boxes had been stowed
away on the flat top of the bedstead. All the
chairs, which were old fashioned mahogany ones,
had sound backs and bottoms.</p>

<p>Of the third class, or the very poor, I chose
the following “type” out of the many others
that presented themselves. The family here
lived in a small slanting-roofed house, partly
stripped of its tiles. More than one half of the
small leaden squares of the first-floor window
were covered with brown paper, puffing out and
crackling in the wind, while through the greater
part of the others were thrust out ball-shaped
bundles of rags, to keep out the breeze. The
panes that did remain were of all shapes and
sizes, and at a distance had the appearance of
yellow glass, they were so stained with dirt. I
opened a door with a number chalked on it, and
groped my way up a broken tottering staircase.</p>

<p>It took me some time after I had entered the
apartment before I could get accustomed to the
smoke, that came pouring into the room from
the chimney. The place was filled with it,
curling in the light, and making every thing so
indistinct that I could with difficulty see the
white mugs ranged in the corner-cupboard, not
three yards from me. When the wind was in
the north, or when it rained, it was always that
way, I was told, “but otherwise,” said an old
dame about sixty, with long grisly hair spreading
over her black shawl, “it is pretty good for
that.”</p>

<p>On a mattrass, on the floor, lay a pale-faced
girl&mdash;“eighteen years old last twelfth-cake day”&mdash;her
drawn-up form showing in the patch-work
counterpane that covered her. She had just
been confined, and the child had died! A little
straw, stuffed into an old tick, was all she
had to lie upon, and even that had been given
up to her by the mother until she was well
enough to work again. To shield her from the
light of the window, a cloak had been fastened
up slantingly across the panes; and on a string
that ran along the wall was tied, amongst the
bonnets, a clean nightcap&mdash;“against the doctor
came,” as the mother, curtsying, informed me.
By the side of the bed, almost hidden in the dark
shade, was a pile of sieve baskets, crowned by
the flat shallow that the mother “worked” with.</p>

<p>The room was about nine feet square, and
furnished a home for three women. The ceiling
slanted like that of a garret, and was the colour
of old leather, excepting a few rough white
patches, where the tenants had rudely mended
it. The white light was easily seen through the
laths, and in one corner a large patch of the
paper looped down from the wall. One night
the family had been startled from their sleep by
a large mass of mortar&mdash;just where the roof
bulged in&mdash;falling into the room. “We never
want rain water,” the woman told me, “for we
can catch plenty just over the chimney-place.”</p>

<p>They had made a carpet out of three or four
old mats. They were “obligated to it, for fear
of dropping anything through the boards into
the donkey stables in the parlour underneath.
But we only pay ninepence a week rent,” said
the old woman, “and mustn’t grumble.”</p>

<p>The only ornament in the place was on the
mantel-piece&mdash;an old earthenware sugar-basin,
well silvered over, that had been given by the
eldest girl when she died, as a remembrance to
her mother. Two cracked tea-cups, on their
inverted saucers, stood on each side, and dressed
up the fire-side into something like tidiness.
The chair I sat on was by far the best out of
the three in the room, and that had no back,
and only half its quantity of straw.</p>

<p>The parish, the old woman told me, allowed
her 1<i>s.</i> a week and two loaves. But the doctor
ordered her girl to take sago and milk, and she
was many a time sorely puzzled to get it. The
neighbours helped her a good deal, and often
sent her part of their unsold greens;&mdash;even if
it was only the outer leaves of the cabbages, she
was thankful for them. Her other girl&mdash;a big-boned
wench, with a red shawl crossed over her
bosom, and her black hair parted on one side&mdash;did
all she could, and so they lived on. “As
long as they kept out of the ‘big house’ (the
workhouse) she would not complain.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Dress of the Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>From the homes of the costermongers we pass
to a consideration of their dress.</p>

<p>The costermonger’s ordinary costume partakes
of the durability of the warehouseman’s, with the
quaintness of that of the stable-boy. A well-to-do
“coster,” when dressed for the day’s
work, usually wears a small cloth cap, a little
on one side. A close-fitting worsted tie-up
skull-cap, is very fashionable, just now, among
the class, and ringlets at the temples are looked
up to as the height of elegance. Hats they
never wear&mdash;excepting on Sunday&mdash;on account
of their baskets being frequently carried on
their heads. Coats are seldom indulged in;
their waistcoats, which are of a broad-ribbed
corduroy, with fustian back and sleeves, being
made as long as a groom’s, and buttoned
up nearly to the throat. If the corduroy
be of a light sandy colour, then plain brass, or
sporting buttons, with raised fox’s or stag’s heads
upon them&mdash;or else black bone-buttons, with a
flower-pattern&mdash;ornament the front; but if the
cord be of a dark rat-skin hue, then mother-of-pearl
buttons are preferred. Two large pockets&mdash;sometimes
four&mdash;with huge flaps or lappels,
like those in a shooting-coat, are commonly
worn. If the costermonger be driving a good
trade and have his set of regular customers, he
will sport a blue cloth jacket, similar in cut to
the cord ones above described; but this is
looked upon as an extravagance of the highest
order, for the slime and scales of the fish stick to
the sleeves and shoulders of the garment, so as
to spoil the appearance of it in a short time. The
fashionable stuff for trousers, at the present, is a
dark-coloured “cable cord,” and they are made
to fit tightly at the knee and swell gradually
until they reach the boot, which they nearly
cover. Velveteen is now seldom worn, and knee-breeches
are quite out of date. Those who deal
wholly in fish wear a blue serge apron, either
hanging down or tucked up round their waist.
The costermonger, however, prides himself most
of all upon his neckerchief and boots. Men, women,
boys and girls, all have a passion for these
articles. The man who does not wear his silk
neckerchief&mdash;his “King’s-man” as it is called&mdash;is
known to be in desperate circumstances;
the inference being that it has gone to supply
the morning’s stock-money. A yellow flower
on a green ground, or a red and blue pattern, is
at present greatly in vogue. The women wear
their kerchiefs tucked-in under their gowns,
and the men have theirs wrapped loosely round
the neck, with the ends hanging over their
waistcoats. Even if a costermonger has two or
three silk handkerchiefs by him already, he seldom
hesitates to buy another, when tempted
with a bright showy pattern hanging from a
Field-lane door-post.</p>

<p>The costermonger’s love of a good strong boot
is a singular prejudice that runs throughout the
whole class. From the father to the youngest
child, all will be found well shod. So strong is
their predilection in this respect, that a costermonger
may be immediately known by a glance
at his feet. He will part with everything rather
than his boots, and to wear a pair of second-hand
ones, or “translators” (as they are called), is
felt as a bitter degradation by them all. Among
the men, this pride has risen to such a pitch,
that many will have their upper-leathers tastily
ornamented, and it is not uncommon to see the
younger men of this class with a heart or a
thistle, surrounded by a wreath of roses, worked
below the instep, on their boots. The general
costume of the women or girls is a black
velveteen or straw bonnet, with a few ribbons or
flowers, and almost always a net cap fitting
closely to the cheek. The silk “King’s-man”
covering their shoulders, is sometimes tucked
into the neck of the printed cotton-gown, and
sometimes the ends are brought down outside
to the apron-strings. Silk dresses are never
worn by them&mdash;they rather despise such articles.
The petticoats are worn short, ending at
the ankles, just high enough to show the
whole of the much-admired boots. Coloured,
or “illustrated shirts,” as they are called, are
especially objected to by the men.</p>

<p>On the Sunday no costermonger will, if he
can possibly avoid it, wheel a barrow. If a
shilling be an especial object to him, he may,
perhaps, take his shallow and head-basket as
far as Chalk-farm, or some neighbouring resort;
but even then he objects strongly to the Sunday-trading.
They leave this to the Jews and
Irish, who are always willing to earn a penny&mdash;as
they say.</p>

<p>The prosperous coster <i>will</i> have his holiday
on the Sunday, and, if possible, his Sunday suit
as well&mdash;which usually consists of a rough
beaver hat, brown Petersham, with velvet
facings of the same colour, and cloth trousers,
with stripes down the side. The women, generally,
manage to keep by them a cotton gown
of a bright showy pattern, and a new shawl.
As one of the craft said to me&mdash;“Costers likes
to see their gals and wives look lady-like when
they takes them out.” Such of the costers as
are not in a flourishing way of business, seldom
make any alteration in their dress on the
Sunday.</p>

<p>There are but five tailors in London who
make the garb proper to costermongers; one of
these is considered somewhat “slop,” or as a
coster called him, a “springer-up.”</p>

<p>This springer-up is blamed by some of the
costermongers, who condemn him for employing
women at reduced wages. A whole court of
costermongers, I was assured, would withdraw
their custom from a tradesman, if one of their
body, who had influence among them, showed
that the tradesman was unjust to his workpeople.
The tailor in question issues bills after the following
fashion. I give one verbatim, merely
withholding the address for obvious reasons:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Diet and Drink of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>It is less easy to describe the diet of costermongers
than it is to describe that of many
other of the labouring classes, for their diet, so
to speak, is an “out-door diet.” They breakfast
at a coffee-stall, and (if all their means have
been expended in purchasing their stock, and
none of it be yet sold) they expend on the
meal only 1<i>d.</i>, reserved for the purpose. For
this sum they can procure a small cup of coffee,
and two “thin” (that is to say two thin
slices of bread and butter). For dinner&mdash;which
on a week-day is hardly ever eaten
at the costermonger’s abode&mdash;they buy “block
ornaments,” as they call the small, dark-coloured
pieces of meat exposed on the cheap
butchers’ blocks or counters. These they cook
in a tap-room; half a pound costing 2<i>d.</i> If
time be an object, the coster buys a hot pie
or two; preferring fruit-pies when in season,
and next to them meat-pies. “We never eat
eel-pies,” said one man to me, “because we
know they’re often made of large dead eels.
<i>We</i>, of all people, are not to be had that way.
But the haristocrats eats ’em and never knows
the difference.” I did not hear that these men
had any repugnance to meat-pies; but the use of
the dead eel happens to come within the immediate
knowledge of the costermongers, who
are, indeed, its purveyors. Saveloys, with a
pint of beer, or a glass of “short” (neat gin)
is with them another common week-day dinner.
The costers make all possible purchases of
street-dealers, and pride themselves in thus
“sticking to their own.” On Sunday, the
costermonger, when not “cracked up,” enjoys
a good dinner at his own abode. This is
always a joint&mdash;most frequently a shoulder
or half-shoulder of mutton&mdash;and invariably
with “lots of good taturs baked along with
it.” In the quality of their potatoes these
people are generally particular.</p>

<p>The costermonger’s usual beverage is beer,
and many of them drink hard, having no other
way of spending their leisure but in drinking
and gambling. It is not unusual in “a good
time,” for a costermonger to spend 12<i>s.</i> out of
every 20<i>s.</i> in beer and pleasure.</p>

<p>I ought to add, that the “single fellows,”
instead of living on “block ornaments” and the
like, live, when doing well, on the best fare, at
the “spiciest” cook-shops on their rounds, or in
the neighbourhood of their residence.</p>

<p>There are some families of costermongers who
have persevered in carrying out the principles
of teetotalism. One man thought there might
be 200 individuals, including men, women, and
children, who practised total abstinence from
intoxicating drinks. These parties are nearly all
somewhat better off than their drinking companions.
The number of teetotallers amongst
the costers, however, was more numerous three
or four years back.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cries, Rounds, and Days of
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I shall now proceed to treat of the London
costermongers’ mode of doing business.</p>

<p>In the first place all the goods they sell are
cried or “hawked,” and the cries of the costermongers
in the present day are as varied as the
articles they sell. The principal ones, uttered
in a sort of cadence, are now, “Ni-ew mackerel,
6 a shilling.” (“I’ve got a good jacketing many
a Sunday morning,” said one dealer, “for waking
people up with crying mackerel, but I’ve said,
‘I must live while you sleep.’”) “Buy a pair
of live soles, 3 pair for 6<i>d.</i>”&mdash;or, with a barrow,
“Soles, 1<i>d.</i> a pair, 1<i>d.</i> a pair;” “Plaice alive,
alive, cheap;” “Buy a pound crab, cheap;”
“Pine-apples, &frac12;<i>d.</i> a slice;” “Mussels a penny
a quart;” “Oysters, a penny a lot;” “Salmon
alive, 6<i>d.</i> a pound;” “Cod alive, 2<i>d.</i> a pound;”
“Real Yarmouth bloaters, 2 a penny;” “New
herrings alive, 16 a groat” (this is the loudest
cry of any); “Penny a bunch turnips” (the
same with greens, cabbages, &amp;c.); “All new nuts,
1<i>d.</i> half-pint;” “Oranges, 2 a penny;” “All
large and alive-O, new sprats, O, 1<i>d.</i> a plate;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
“Wi-ild Hampshire rabbits, 2 a shilling;”
“Cherry ripe, 2<i>d.</i> a pound;” “Fine ripe
plums, 1<i>d.</i> a pint;” “Ing-uns, a penny a quart;”
“Eels, 3lbs. a shilling&mdash;large live eels 3lbs. a
shilling.”</p>

<p>The continual calling in the streets is very
distressing to the voice. One man told me that
it had broken his, and that very often while out
he lost his voice altogether. “They seem to
have no breath,” the men say, “after calling for
a little while.” The repeated shouting brings
on a hoarseness, which is one of the peculiar
characteristics of hawkers in general. The
costers mostly go out with a boy to cry their
goods for them. If they have two or three hallooing
together, it makes more noise than one, and
the boys can shout better and louder than the
men. The more noise they can make in a place
the better they find their trade. Street-selling
has been so bad lately that many have been
obliged to have a drum for their bloaters, “to
drum the fish off,” as they call it.</p>

<p>In the second place, the costermongers, as I
said before, have mostly their little bit of a
“round;” that is, they go only to certain places;
and if they don’t sell their goods they “work
back” the same way again. If they visit a
respectable quarter, they confine themselves to
the mews near the gentlemen’s houses. They
generally prefer the poorer neighbourhoods.
They go down or through almost all the courts
and alleys&mdash;and avoid the better kind of streets,
unless with lobsters, rabbits, or onions. If they
have anything inferior, they visit the low Irish
districts&mdash;for the Irish people, they say, want
only quantity, and care nothing about quality&mdash;<i>that</i>
they don’t study. But if they have anything
they wish to make a price of, they seek
out the mews, and try to get it off among the
gentlemen’s coachmen, for <i>they</i> will have what
is good; or else they go among the residences
of mechanics,&mdash;for their wives, they say, like
good-living as well as the coachmen. Some
costers, on the other hand, go chance rounds.</p>

<p>Concerning the busiest days of the week for
the coster’s trade, they say Wednesdays and
Fridays are the best, because they are regular
fish days. These two days are considered to be
those on which the poorer classes generally run
short of money. Wednesday night is called “draw
night” among some mechanics and labourers&mdash;that
is, they then get a portion of their
wages in advance, and on Friday they run short
as well as on the Wednesday, and have to make
shift for their dinners. With the few halfpence
they have left, they are glad to pick up anything
cheap, and the street-fishmonger never refuses an
offer. Besides, he can supply them with a cheaper
dinner than any other person. In the season the
poor generally dine upon herrings. The poorer
classes live mostly on fish, and the “dropped”
and “rough” fish is bought chiefly for the poor.
The fish-huckster has no respect for persons,
however; one assured me that if Prince Halbert
was to stop him in the street to buy a pair of soles
of him, he’d as soon sell him a “rough pair as any
other man&mdash;indeed, I’d take in my own father,”
he added, “if he wanted to deal with me.”
Saturday is the worst day of all for fish, for then
the poor people have scarcely anything at all to
spend; Saturday night, however, the street-seller
takes more money than at any other time
in the week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers on their Country
Rounds.</span></h3>

<p>Some costermongers go what they term “country
rounds,” and they speak of their country expeditions
as if they were summer excursions
of mere pleasure. They are generally variations
from a life growing monotonous. It was computed
for me that at present three out of every
twenty costermongers “take a turn in the country”
at least once a year. Before the prevalence
of railways twice as many of these men carried
their speculations in fish, fruit, or vegetables to
a country mart. Some did so well that they
never returned to London. Two for instance,
after a country round, settled at Salisbury; they
are now regular shopkeepers, “and very respectable,
too,” was said to me, “for I believe they
are both pretty tidy off for money; and are
growing rich.” The railway communication
supplies the local-dealer with fish, vegetables,
or any perishable article, with such rapidity
and cheapness that the London itinerant’s
occupation in the towns and villages about the
metropolis is now half gone.</p>

<p>In the following statement by a costermonger,
the mode of life on a country round, is detailed
with something of an assumption of metropolitan
superiority.</p>

<p>“It was fine times, sir, ten year back, aye,
and five year back, in the country, and it ain’t
so bad now, if a man’s known. It depends on
that now far more than it did, and on a man’s
knowing how to work a village. Why, I can
tell you if it wasn’t for such as me, there’s many
a man working on a farm would never taste
such a nice thing as a fresh herring&mdash;never, sir.
It’s a feast at a poor country labourer’s place,
when he springs six-penn’orth of fresh herrings,
some for supper, and some in salt for next day.
I’ve taken a shillings’-worth to a farmer’s door
of a darkish night in a cold autumn, and they’d
a warm and good dish for supper, and looked on
me as a sort of friend. We carry them relishes
from London; and they like London relishes, for
we know how to set them off. I’ve fresh herringed
a whole village near Guildford, first thing in the
morning. I’ve drummed round Guildford too,
and done well. I’ve waked up Kingston with
herrings. I’ve been as welcome as anything to
the soldiers in the barracks at Brentwood, and
Romford, and Maidstone with my fresh herrings;
for they’re good customers. In two days I’ve
made 2<i>l.</i> out of 10<i>s.</i> worth of fresh herrings,
bought at Billingsgate. I always lodge at a
public-house in the country; so do all of us,
for the publicans are customers. We are well
received at the public-houses; some of us go
there for the handiness of the ‘lush.’ I’ve done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pretty well with red herrings in the country. A
barrel holds (say) 800. We sell the barrels at
6<i>d.</i> a piece, and the old women fight after them.
They pitch and tar them, to make water-barrels.
More of us would settle in the country, only
there’s no life there.”</p>

<p>The most frequented round is from Lambeth
to Wandsworth, Kingston, Richmond, Guildford,
and Farnham. The costermonger is then “sold
out,” as he calls it,&mdash;he has disposed of his
stock, and returns by the way which is most
lightly tolled, no matter if the saving of 1<i>d.</i> or
2<i>d.</i> entail some miles extra travelling. “It cost
me 15<i>d.</i> for tolls from Guildford for an empty
cart and donkey,” said a costermonger just up
from the country.</p>

<p>Another round is to Croydon, Reigate, and
the neighbourhoods; another to Edgeware, Kilburn,
Watford, and Barnet; another to Maidstone;
but the costermonger, if he starts trading
at a distance, as he now does frequently, has
his barrow and goods sent down by railway to
such towns as Maidstone, so he saves the delay
and cost of a donkey-cart. A “mate” sees to
the transmission of the goods from London, the
owner walking to Maidstone to be in readiness
to “work” them immediately he receives them.
“The railway’s an ease and a saving,” I was
told; “I’ve got a stock sent for 2<i>s.</i>, and a donkey’s
keep would cost that for the time it would
be in travelling. There’s 5,000 of us, I think,
might get a living in the country, if we stuck to
it entirely.”</p>

<p>If the country enterprise be a failure, the men
sometimes abandon it in “a pet,” sell their goods
at any loss, and walk home, generally getting
drunk as the first step to their return. Some
have been known to pawn their barrow on the
road for drink. This they call “doing queer.”</p>

<p>In summer the costermongers carry plums,
peas, new potatoes, cucumbers, and quantities
of pickling vegetables, especially green walnuts,
to the country. In winter their commodities are
onions, fresh and red herrings, and sprats. “I
don’t know how it is,” said one man to me,
“but we sell ing-uns and all sorts of fruits and
vegetables, cheaper than they can buy them
where they’re grown; and green walnuts, too,
when you’d think they had only to be knocked
off a tree.”</p>

<p>Another costermonger told me that, in the
country, he and his mates attended every dance
or other amusement, “if it wasn’t too respectable.”
Another said: “If I’m idle in the
country on a Sunday, I never go to church. I
never was in a church; I don’t know why, for
my silk handkerchief’s worth more than one of
their smock-frocks, and is quite as respectable.”</p>

<p>Some costermongers confine their exertions to
the fairs and races, and many of them are connected
with the gipsies, who are said to be the
usual receivers of the stolen handkerchiefs at
such places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Earnings of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The earnings of the costermonger&mdash;the next
subject of inquiry that, in due order, presents
itself&mdash;vary as much as in more fashionable
callings, for he is greatly dependent on the
season, though he may be little affected by London
being full or empty.</p>

<p>Concurrent testimony supplied me with the
following estimate of their earnings. I cite the
average earnings (apart from any charges or
drawbacks), of the most staple commodities:</p>

<p>In January and February the costers generally
sell fish. In these months the wealthier of the
street fishmongers, or those who can always command
“money to go to market,” enjoy a kind of
monopoly. The wintry season renders the supply
of fish dearer and less regular, so that the poorer
dealers cannot buy “at first hand,” and sometimes
cannot be supplied at all; while the others
monopolise the fish, more or less, and will not
sell it to any of the other street-dealers until a
profit has been realised out of their own regular
customers, and the demand partially satisfied.
“Why, I’ve known one man sell 10<i>l.</i> worth of
fish&mdash;most of it mackarel&mdash;at his stall in
Whitecross-street,” said a costermonger to me,
“and all in one snowy day, in last January.
It was very stormy at that time, and fish came
in unregular, and he got a haul. I’ve known
him sell 2<i>l.</i> worth in an hour, and once 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
worth, for I then helped at his stall. If people
has dinner parties they must have fish, and
gentlemen’s servants came to buy.” The <i>average</i>
earnings however of those that “go rounds”
in these months are computed not to exceed 8<i>s.</i>
a week; Monday and Saturday being days of
little trade in fish.</p>

<p>“March is dreadful,” said an itinerant fish
seller to me; “we don’t average, I’m satisfied,
more nor 4<i>s.</i> a week. I’ve had my barrow idle
for a week sometimes&mdash;at home every day,
though it had to be paid for, all the same. At
the latter end of March, if it’s fine, it’s 1<i>s.</i> a
week better, because there’s flower roots in&mdash;‘all
a-growing,’ you know, sir. And that lasts
until April, and we then make above 6<i>s.</i> a week.
I’ve heard people say when I’ve cried ‘all a-growing’
on a fine-ish day, ‘Aye, now summer’s
a-coming.’ I wish you may get it, says I to
myself; for I’ve studied the seasons.”</p>

<p>In May the costermonger’s profit is greater.
He vends fresh fish&mdash;of which there is a greater
supply and a greater demand, and the fine and
often not very hot weather insures its freshness&mdash;and
he sells dried herrings and “roots” (as they
are called) such as wall-flowers and stocks.
The average earnings then are from 10<i>s.</i> to
12<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>In June, new potatoes, peas, and beans tempt
the costermongers’ customers, and then his earnings
rise to 1<i>l.</i> a week. In addition to this 1<i>l.</i>,
if the season allow, a costermonger at the end of
the week, I was told by an experienced hand,
“will earn an extra 10<i>s.</i> if he has anything of
a round.” “Why, I’ve cleared thirty shillings
myself,” he added, “on a Saturday night.”</p>

<p>In July cherries are the principal article of
traffic, and then the profit varies from 4<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a day, weather permitting, or 30<i>s.</i> a week on a
low average. On my inquiry if they did not
sell fish in that month, the answer was, “No,
sir; we pitch fish to the &mdash;&mdash;; we stick to
cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and ripe
currants and gooseberries. Potatoes is getting
good and cheap then, and so is peas. Many a
round’s worth a crown every day of the week.”</p>

<p>In August, the chief trading is in Orleans
plums, green-gages, apples and pears, and in
this month the earnings are from 5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> a
day. [I may here remark that the costermongers
care little to deal in either vegetables or
fish, “when the fruit’s in,” but they usually
carry a certain supply of vegetables all the year
round, for those customers who require them.]</p>

<p>In September apples are vended, and about
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day made.</p>

<p>In October “the weather gets cold,” I was
told, “and the apples gets fewer, and the day’s
work’s over at four; we then deals most in fish,
such as soles; there’s a good bit done in oysters,
and we may make 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, but it’s
uncertain.”</p>

<p>In November fish and vegetables are the chief
commodities, and then from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day
is made; but in the latter part of the month an
extra 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> a day may be cleared, as sprats
come in and sell well when newly introduced.</p>

<p>In December the trade is still principally in
fish, and 12<i>d.</i> or 18<i>d.</i> a day is the costermonger’s
earnings. Towards the close of the month he
makes rather more, as he deals in new oranges
and lemons, holly, ivy, &amp;c., and in Christmas
week he makes 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> a day.</p>

<p>These calculations give an average of about
14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, when a man pursues his trade
regularly. One man calculated it for me at 15<i>s.</i>
average the year through&mdash;that is supposing,
of course, that the larger earnings of the summer
are carefully put by to eke out the winter’s
income. This, I need hardly say, is never done.
Prudence is a virtue, which is comparatively
unknown to the London costermongers. They
have no knowledge of savings’-banks; and to
expect that they themselves should keep their
money by them untouched for months (even if
they had the means of so doing) is simply to
expect impossibilities&mdash;to look for the continued
withstanding of temptation among a class who
are unused to the least moral or prudential
restraint.</p>

<p><i>Some</i> costers, I am told, make upwards of 30<i>s.</i>
a week all the year round; but allowing for cessations
in the street-trade, through bad weather,
neglect, ill-health, or casualty of any kind, and
taking the more prosperous costers with the less
successful&mdash;the English with the Irish&mdash;the
men with the women&mdash;perhaps 10<i>s.</i> a week may
be a fair average of the earnings of the entire
body the year through.</p>

<p>These earnings, I am assured, were five years
ago at least 25 per cent. higher; some said they
made half as much again: “I can’t make it
out how it is,” said one man, “but I remember
that I could go out and sell twelve bushel of
fruit in a day, when sugar was dear, and now,
when sugar’s cheap, I can’t sell three bushel on
the same round. Perhaps we want thinning.”</p>

<p>Such is the state of the working-classes; say
all the costers, they have little or no money to
spend. “Why, I can assure you,” declared one of
the parties from whom I obtained much important
information, “there’s my missis&mdash;she sits at
the corner of the street with fruit. Eight years
ago she would have taken 8<i>s.</i> out of that street
on a Saturday, and last Saturday week she had
one bushel of apples, which cost 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> She
was out from ten in the morning till ten at night,
and all she took that day was 1<i>s.</i> 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> Go to
whoever you will, you will hear much upon the
same thing.” Another told me, “The costers
are often obliged to sell the things for what they
gave for them. The people haven’t got money
to lay out with them&mdash;they tell us so; and if
they are poor we must be poor too. If we can’t
get a profit upon what goods we buy with our
stock-money, let it be our own or anybody’s
else, we are compelled to live upon it, and when
that’s broken into, we must either go to the
workhouse or starve. If we go to the workhouse,
they’ll give us a piece of dry bread, and abuse us
worse than dogs.” Indeed, the whole course of
my narratives shows how the costers generally&mdash;though
far from universally&mdash;complain of the
depressed state of their trade. The following
statement was given to me by a man who, for
twelve years, had been a stall-keeper in a street-market.
It shows to what causes he (and I
found others express similar opinions) attributes
the <span class="lock">depression:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I never knew things so bad as at present&mdash;never!
I had six prime cod-fish, weighing 15lbs.
to 20lbs. each, yesterday and the day before, and
had to take two home with me last night, and
lost money on the others&mdash;besides all my time,
and trouble, and expense. I had 100 herrings,
too, that cost 3<i>s.</i>&mdash;prime quality, and I only sold
ten out of them in a whole day. I had two pads
of soles, sir, and lost 4<i>s.</i>&mdash;that is one pad&mdash;by
them. I took only 4<i>s.</i> the first day I laid in this
stock, and only 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the next; I then had to
sell for anything I could get, and throw some
away. Yet, people say mine’s a lazy, easy life.
I think the fall off is owing to meat being so
cheap, ’cause people buy that rather than my
goods, as they think there’s more stay in it.
I’m afeard things will get worse too.” (He then
added by way of <i>sequitur</i>, though it is difficult
to follow the reasoning,) “If this here is free-trade,
then to h&mdash; with it, I say!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Capital and Income of the
Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I shall now pass, from the consideration of the
individual earnings, to the income and capital
of the entire body. Great pains have been
taken to ensure exactitude on these points, and
the following calculations are certainly below
the mark. In order to be within due bounds,
I will take the costermongers, exclusive of
their wives and families, at 10,000, whereas it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would appear that their numbers are upwards
of 11,000.</p>

<p>Very nearly 24,000<i>l.</i>, then, at the most moderate
computation, represents the value of the
animals, vehicles, and stock, belonging to the
costermongers in the streets of London.</p>

<p>The keep of the donkeys is not here mixed
up with their value, and I have elsewhere
spoken of it.</p>

<p>The whole course of my narrative shows that
the bulk of the property in the street goods,
and in the appliances for their sale, is in the
hands of usurers as well as of the costers. The
following account shows the sum paid yearly
by the London costermongers for the hire, rent,
or interest (I have heard each word applied) of
their barrows, weights, baskets, and stock:</p>

<tr><td>Total paid for hire and interest</td><td class="right total">£17,400</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Concerning the income of the entire body of
costermongers in the metropolis, I estimate the
earnings of the 10,000 costermongers, taking
the average of the year, at 10<i>s.</i> weekly. My
own observation, the result of my inquiries, confirmed
by the opinion of some of the most
intelligent of the costermongers, induce me to
adopt this amount. It must be remembered,
that if some costermongers do make 30<i>s.</i> a week
through the year, others will not earn a fourth
of it, and hence many of the complaints and
sufferings of the class. Then there is the drawback
in the sum paid for “hire,” “interest,”
&amp;c., by numbers of these people; so that it
appears to me, that if we assume the income of
the entire body&mdash;including Irish and English&mdash;to
be 15<i>s.</i> a week per head in the summer, and
5<i>s.</i> a week each in the winter, as the two extremes,
or a mean of 10<i>s.</i> a week all the year
through, we shall not be far out either way.
The aggregate earnings of the London costermongers,
at this rate, are 5,000<i>l.</i> per week, or
260,000<i>l.</i> yearly. Reckoning that 30,000 individuals
have to be supported out of this sum, it
gives an average of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a week per head.</p>

<p>But it is important to ascertain not only the
earnings or aggregate amount of profit made by
the London costermongers in the course of the
year, but likewise their receipts, or aggregate
amount of “takings,” and thus to arrive at the
gross sum of money annually laid out by the
poorer classes of the metropolis in the matter
of fish, fruit, and vegetables alone. Assuming
that the average profits of the costermongers
are at the rate of 25 per cent. (and this, I am
satisfied, is a high estimate&mdash;for we should
remember, that though cent. per cent. may be
frequently obtained, still their “goods,” being of
a “perishable” nature, are as frequently lost or
sold off at a “tremendous sacrifice”); assuming
then, I say, that the <i>average</i> profits of the entire
10,000 individuals are 25 per cent. on the cost-price
of their stock, and that the aggregate
amount of their profits or earnings is upwards
of 260,000<i>l.</i>, it follows that the gross sum of
money laid out with the London costers in
the course of the twelvemonth is 1,040,000<i>l.</i> sterling&mdash;a sum so
enormous as almost to make us believe that
the tales of individual want are matters of pure
fiction. Large, however, as the amount appears
in the mass, still, if distributed among the
families of the working men and the poorer class
of Londoners, it will be found that it allows but
the merest pittance per head per week for the
consumption of those articles, which may be
fairly said to constitute the staple commodities
of the dinners and “desserts!” of the poor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Providence and Improvidence
of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The costermongers, like all wandering tribes,
have generally no foresight; only an exceptional
few are provident&mdash;and these are mostly the
more intelligent of the class&mdash;though some of
the very ignorant do occasionally save. The
providence of the more intelligent costermonger
enables him in some few cases to become “a
settled man,” as I have before pointed out. He
perhaps gets to be the proprietor of a coal-shed,
with a greengrocery and potato business attached
to it; and with the usual trade in oysters and
ginger-beer. He may too, sometimes, have a sum
of money in the savings’-bank, or he may invest
it in the purchase of a lease of the premises he
occupies, or expend it in furnishing the rooms of
his house to let them out to single-men lodgers;
or he may become an usurer, and lend out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
money to his less provident brethren at 1040<i>l.</i>
per cent. per annum; or he may purchase largely
at the markets, and engage youths to sell his
surplus stock at half profits.</p>

<p>The provident costermonger, who has thus
“got on in the world,” is rarely speculative. He
can hardly be induced to become a member of a
“building” or “freehold land” society, for instance.
He has been accustomed to an almost
<i>immediate</i> return for his outlays, and distrusts
any remote or contingent profit. A regular costermonger&mdash;or
any one who has been a regular
costermonger, in whatever trade he may be afterwards
engaged&mdash;generally dies intestate, let his
property be what it may; but there is seldom
any dispute as to the disposition of his effects:
the widow takes possession of them, as a matter
of course. If there be grown-up children, they
may be estranged from home, and not trouble
their heads about the matter; or, if not estranged,
an amicable arrangement is usually
come to. The costermongers’ dread of all courts
of law, or of anything connected with the law,
is only second to their hatred of the police.</p>

<p>The more ignorant costermonger, on the other
hand, if he be of a saving turn, and have no
great passion for strong drink or gaming, is often
afraid to resort to the simple modes of investment
which I have mentioned. He will rather
keep money in his pocket; for, though it does
not fructify there, at least it is safe. But this
is only when provided with a donkey or pony
“what suits;” when not so provided, he will
“suit himself” forthwith. If, however, he have
saved a little money, and have a craving after
gambling or amusements, he is sure at last to
squander it that way. Such a man, without any
craving for drink or gaming, will often continue
to pay usuriously for the hire of his barrow, not
suspecting that he is purchasing it over and
over and over again, in his weekly payments.
To suggest to him that he might place his
money in a bank, is to satisfy him that he would
be “had” in some way or other, as he believes
all banks and public institutions to be connected
with government, and the taxes, and the police.
Were any one to advise a man of this class&mdash;and
it must be remembered that I am speaking of
the <i>ignorant</i> costers&mdash;to invest a spare 50<i>l.</i>
(supposing he possessed it) in the “three per
cents.,” it would but provoke a snappish remark
that he knew nothing about them, and would
have nothing to do with them; for he would
be satisfied that there was “some cheatery at
the bottom.” If he could be made to understand
what is meant by 3<i>l.</i> per centum per
annum, he would be sure to be indignant at the
robbery of giving only 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> for the use of 1<i>l.</i>
for a whole year!</p>

<p>I may state, in conclusion, that a costermonger
of the class I have been describing, mostly objects
to give change for a five-pound note; he will
sooner give credit&mdash;when he knows “the party”&mdash;than
change, even if he have it. If, however,
he feels compelled, rather than offend a regular
customer, to take the note, he will not rest
until he has obtained sovereigns for it at a
neighbouring innkeeper’s, or from some tradesman
to whom he is known. “Sovereigns,”
said one man, and not a very ignorant man,
to me, “is something to lay hold on; a note
ain’t.”</p>

<p>Moreover, should one of the more ignorant,
having tastes for the beer-shop, &amp;c., meet with
“a great haul,” or save 5<i>l.</i> by some continuous
industry (which he will most likely set down as
“luck”), he will spend it idly or recklessly in
dissipation and amusement, regardless of the
coming winter, whatever he may have suffered
during the past. Nor, though they know, from
the bitterest experience, that their earnings in
the winter are not half those of the rest of the
year, and that they are incapacitated from
pursuing their trade in bad weather, do they
endeavour to make the extra gains of their best
time mitigate the want of the worst.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers in Bad Weather
and during the Cholera.</span></h3>

<p>“Three wet days,” I was told by a clergyman,
who is now engaged in selling stenographic
cards in the streets, “will bring the greater part
of 30,000 street-people to the brink of starvation.”
This statement, terrible as it is, is not
exaggerated. The average number of wet days
every year in London is, according to the records
of the Royal Society, 161&mdash;that is to say, rain
falls in the metropolis more than three days in
each week, and very nearly every other day
throughout the year. How precarious a means
of living then must street-selling be!</p>

<p>When a costermonger cannot pursue his out-door
labour, he leaves it to the women and
children to “work the public-houses,” while
he spends his time in the beer-shop. Here he
gambles away his stock-money oft enough, “if
the cards or the luck runs again him;” or
else he has to dip into his stock-money to
support himself and his family. He must
then borrow fresh capital at any rate of interest
to begin again, and he begins on a small scale.
If it be in the cheap and busy seasons, he may
buy a pad of soles for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and clear 5<i>s.</i> on
them, and that “sets him a-going again, and
then he gets his silk handkerchief out of pawn,
and goes as usual to market.”</p>

<p>The sufferings of the costermongers during
the prevalence of the cholera in 1849, were intense.
Their customers generally relinquished
the consumption of potatoes, greens, fruit, and
fish; indeed, of almost every article on the consumption
of which the costermongers depend
for his daily bread. Many were driven to
apply to the parish; “many had relief and
many hadn’t,” I was told. Two young men,
within the knowledge of one of my informants,
became professional thieves, after enduring
much destitution. It does not appear that the
costermongers manifested any personal dread of
the visitation of the cholera, or thought that
their lives were imperilled: “We weren’t a bit
afraid,” said one of them, “and, perhaps, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was the reason so few costers died of the cholera.
I knew them all in Lambeth, I think, and I
knew only one die of it, and he drank hard.
Poor Waxy! he was a good fellow enough, and
was well known in the Cut. But it was a terrible
time for us, sir. It seems to me now like
a shocking dream. Fish I could’nt sell a bit
of; the people had a perfect dread of it&mdash;all
but the poor Irish, and there was no making a
crust out of them. <i>They</i> had no dread of fish,
however; indeed, they reckon it a religious sort
of living, living on fish,&mdash;but they <i>will</i> have
it dirt cheap. We were in terrible distress all
that time.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers’ Raffles.</span></h3>

<p>In their relief of the sick, if relief it is to be
called, the costermongers resort to an exciting
means; something is raffled, and the proceeds
given to the sufferer. This mode is common to
other working-classes; it partakes of the excitement
of gambling, and is encouraged by the
landlords of the houses to which the people
resort. The landlord displays the terms of the
raffle in his bar a few days before the occurrence,
which is always in the evening. The
raffle is not confined to the sick, but when any
one of the class is in distress&mdash;that is to say,
without stock-money, and unable to borrow it,&mdash;a
raffle for some article of his is called at
a public-house in the neighbourhood. Cards
are printed, and distributed among his mates.
The article, let it be whatever it may&mdash;perhaps
a handkerchief&mdash;is put up at 6<i>d.</i> a member, and
from twenty to forty members are got, according
as the man is liked by his “mates,” or as he has
assisted others similarly situated. The paper
of every raffle is kept by the party calling it, and
before he puts his name down to a raffle for another
party, he refers to the list of subscribers
to <i>his</i> raffle, in order to see if the person ever
assisted him. Raffles are very “critical things,
the pint pots fly about wonderful sometimes”&mdash;to
use the words of one of my informants. The
party calling the raffle is expected to take
the chair, if he can write down the subscribers’
names. One who had been chairman at one of
these meetings assured me that on a particular
occasion, having called a “general dealer” to
order, the party very nearly split his head open
with a quart measure. If the hucksters know
that the person calling the raffle is “down,”
and that it is necessity that has made him call
it, they will not allow the property put up to be
thrown for. “If you was to go to the raffle
to-night, sir,” said one of them to me, many
months ago, before I became known to the class,
“they’d say to one another directly you come
in, ‘Who’s this here swell? What’s he want?’
And they’d think you were a ‘cad,’ or else
a spy, come from the police. But they’d treat
you civilly, I’m sure. Some very likely would
fancy you was a fast kind of a gentleman,
come there for a lark. But you need have no
fear, though the pint pots <i>does</i> fly about sometimes.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Markets and Trade Rights of
the Costermongers, and of the laws
affecting them.</span></h3>

<p>The next point of consideration is what are the
legal regulations under which the several descriptions
of hawkers and pedlars are allowed to
pursue their occupations.</p>

<p>The laws concerning hawkers and pedlars,
(50 Geo. III., c. 41, and 6 Geo. IV., c. 80,)
treat of them as identical callings. The
“hawker,” however, is, strictly speaking, one
who sells wares by <i>crying</i> them in the streets
of towns, while the <i>pedlar</i> travels <i>on foot</i> through
the country with his wares, not publicly proclaiming
them, but visiting the houses on his
way to solicit private custom. Until the commencement
of the present century&mdash;before the
increased facilities for conveyance&mdash;the pedlars
were a numerous body in the country. The
majority of them were Scotchmen and some
amassed considerable wealth. Railways, however,
have now reduced the numbers to insignificance.</p>

<p>Hawkers and pedlars are required to pay 4<i>l.</i>
yearly for a license, and an additional 4<i>l.</i> for
every horse or ass employed in the conveyance
of wares. The hawking or exposing for sale of
fish, fruit, or victuals, does not require a license;
and further, it is lawful for any one “being the
maker of any home manufacture,” to expose
it for sale in any fair or market, without a
warrant. Neither does anything in either of
the two acts in question prohibit “any tinker,
cooper, glazier, plumber, harness-mender, or
other person, from going about and carrying the
materials proper to their business.”</p>

<p>The right of the costermongers, then, to
“hawk” their wares through the streets is
plainly inferred by the above acts; that is to
say, nothing in them extends to prohibit persons
“going about,” unlicensed, and at their own
discretion, and selling fish, vegetables, fruit, or
provisions generally.</p>

<p>The law acknowledges none of the street
“markets.” These congregatings are, indeed,
in antagonism to the municipal laws of London,
which provide that no market, or public place
where provisions are sold, shall be held within
seven miles of the city. The law, though it
permits butchers and other provisionmongers to
hire stalls and standings in the flesh and other
markets, recognised by custom or usage, gives
no such permission as to street-trading.</p>

<p>The right to sell provisions from stands in the
streets of the metropolis, it appears, is merely
permissive. The regulation observed is this:
where the costermongers or other street-dealers
have been in the habit of standing to sell their
goods, they are not to be disturbed by the police
unless on complaint of an adjacent shopkeeper
or other inhabitant. If such a person shows that
the costermonger, whose stand is near his premises,
is by his improper conduct a nuisance,
or that, by his clamour or any peculiarity in his
mode of business, he causes a crowd to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and obstruct the thoroughfare, the policeman’s
duty is to remove him. If the complaint from
the inhabitants against the street-sellers be at
all general the policemen of the beat report it
to the authorities, taking no steps until they
receive instructions.</p>

<p>It is somewhat anomalous, however, that the
law now recognises&mdash;inferentially it is true&mdash;the
right of costermongers to carry about their
goods for sale. Formerly the stands were sometimes
tolerated, but not the itinerancy.</p>

<p>The enactments of the Common-council from
the time of Elizabeth are stringent against
itinerant traders of all descriptions, but stringent
to no purpose of prevention. In 1607, a Common-council
enactment sets forth, that “many
People of badd and lewde Condicon daylie
resorte from the most Parte of this Realme to the
said Cyttie, Suburbes, and Places adjoininge, procuringe
themselves small Habytacons, namely,
one Chamber-Roome for a poore Forreynor and
his Familye, in a small Cottage with some other
as poore as himself in the Cyttie, Suburbes, or
Places adjacente, to the great Increase and
Pestringe of this Cyttie with poore People;
many of them proovinge Shifters, lyvinge by
Cozeninge, Stealinge, and Imbeazellinge of
Mens Gooddes as Opportunitye may serve them,
remoovinge from Place to Place accordinglye;
many Tymes runninge away, forsakinge their
Wives and Children, leavinge them to the
Charge of the said Cyttie, and the Hospitalles
of the same.”</p>

<p>It was towards this class of men who, by
their resort to the capital, recruited the numbers
of the street-sellers and public porters and
others that the jealousy of the Corporation
was directed. The city shop-keepers, three centuries
ago, complained vehemently and continuously
of the injuries inflicted on their trade by
itinerant dealers, complaints which led to bootless
enactments. In Elizabeth’s reign the Court
of Common Council declared that the streets of
the city should be used, as in ancient times, for
the common highway, and not for the traffic of
hucksters, pedlars, and hagglers. But this
traffic increased, and in 1632 another enactment
was accounted necessary. Oyster-wives, herb-wives,
tripe-wives, and all such “unruly people,”
were threatened with the full pains and
penalties of the outraged law if they persevered
in the prosecution of their callings, which are
stigmatised as “a way whereby to live a more
easie life than by labour.” In 1694 the street-sellers
were menaced with the punishments then
deemed suitable for arrant rogues and sturdy
beggars&mdash;whipping; and that remedy to be applied
alike to males and females!</p>

<p>The tenor of these Vagrant Laws not being
generally known, I here transcribe them, as
another proof of the “wisdom” and mercy of
our “ancestors” in “the good old times!”</p>

<p>In the year 1530 the English Parliament
enacted, that, while the impotent poor should
receive licenses from the justices of the peace
to beg within certain limits, all men and <i>women</i>,
“being whole and mighty in body, and able to
labour,” if found vagrant and unable to give an
account as to how they obtained their living,
should be apprehended by the constables, tied
to the tail of a cart <i>naked</i>, and beaten with whips
through the nearest market-town, or hamlet,
“till their bodies be bloody by reason of such
whipping!” Five years afterwards it was added,
that, if the individual had been once already
whipped, he or she should not only be whipped
again, but “also shall have the upper part of
the gristle of his ear clean cut off, so as it may
appear for a perpetual token hereafter that he
hath been a contemner of the good order of the
commonwealth.” And finally, in 1562, it was
directed that any beggar convicted of being a
vagabond should, after being grievously whipped,
be burnt through the gristle of the right ear
“with a hot iron of the compass of an inch
about,” unless some person should agree to
take him as a servant&mdash;of course without wages&mdash;for
a year; then, that if he twice ran away
from such master, he should be adjudged a
felon; and that if he ran away a third time, he
should “suffer pains of death and loss of land
and goods as a felon, without benefit of clergy
or sanctuary.”</p>

<p>The only acts now in force which regulate
the government of the streets, so to speak, are
those best known as Michael Angelo Taylor’s
Act, and the 2 &amp; 3 Vic., best known as the
Police Act.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Removals of Costermongers
from the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Such are the laws concerning street trading:
let us now see the effect of them.</p>

<p>Within these three months, or little more, there
have been many removals of the costermongers
from their customary standings in the streets.
This, as I have stated, is never done, unless the
shopkeepers represent to the police that the costermongers
are an injury and a nuisance to them
in the prosecution of their respective trades.
The costermongers, for the most part, know
nothing of the representation of the shopkeepers,
so that perhaps the first intimation that they
must “quit” comes from the policemen, who
thus incur the full odium of the measure, the
majority of the street people esteeming it a mere
arbitrary act on the part of the members of
the force.</p>

<p>The first removal, recently, took place in
Leather-lane, Holborn, between three and four
months back. It was effected in consequence
of representations from the shopkeepers of the
neighbourhood. But the removal was of a brief
continuance. “Leather-lane,” I was told, “looked
like a desert compared to what it was. People
that had lived there for years hardly knew
their own street; and those that had complained,
might twiddle their thumbs in their
shops for want of something better to do.”</p>

<p>The reason, or one reason, why the shopkeepers’
trade is co-existent with that of the
street-sellers was explained to me in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
by a tradesman perfectly familiar with the subject.
“The poorer women, the wives of mechanics
or small tradesmen, who have to prepare
dinners for their husbands, like, as they call it,
‘to make one errand do.’ If the wife buys fish
or vegetables in the street, as is generally done,
she will, at the same time, buy her piece of
bacon or cheese at the cheesemonger’s, her small
quantity of tea and sugar at the grocer’s, her
fire-wood at the oilman’s, or her pound of beef
or liver at the butcher’s. In all the street-markets
there are plenty of such tradesmen,
supplying necessaries not vended in the streets,
and so one errand is sufficient to provide for the
wants of the family. Such customers&mdash;that is,
such as have been used to buy in the streets&mdash;will
<i>not</i> be driven to buy at the shops. They
can’t be persuaded that they can buy as cheap
at the shops; and besides they are apt to think
shopkeepers are rich and street-sellers poor,
and that they may as well encourage the poor.
So if one street-market is abolished, they’ll go
to another, or buy of the itinerant costermongers,
and they’ll get their bits of groceries and the
like at the shops in the neighbourhood of the
other street-market, even if they have a walk for
it; and thus everybody’s injured by removing
markets, except a few, and they are those at
the nearest markets that’s not disturbed.”</p>

<p>In Leather-lane the shopkeepers speedily
retrieved what many soon came to consider the
false step (as regards their interests) which they
had taken, and in a fortnight or so, they managed,
by further representations to the police
authorities, and by agreement with the street-sellers,
that the street-market people should
return. In little more than a fortnight from
that time, Leather-lane, Holborn, resumed its
wonted busy aspect.</p>

<p>In Lambeth the case at present is different.
The men, women, and children, between two and
three months back, were all driven by the police
from their standings. These removals were made,
I am assured, in consequence of representations
to the police from the parishioners, not of Lambeth,
but of the adjoining parish of Christchurch,
Blackfriars-road, who described the market as
an injury and a hindrance to their business. The
costermongers, etc., were consequently driven
from the spot.</p>

<p>A highly respectable tradesman in “the Cut”
told me, that he and all his brother shopkeepers
had found their receipts diminished a quarter,
or an eighth at least, by the removal;
and as in all populous neighbourhoods profits
were small, this falling off was a very serious
matter to them.</p>

<p>In “the Cut” and its immediate neighbourhood,
are tradesmen who supply street-dealers
with the articles they trade in,&mdash;such as cheap
stationery, laces, children’s shoes, braces, and
toys. They, of course, have been seriously affected
by the removal; but the pinch has fallen sorest
upon the street-sellers themselves. These people
depend a good deal one upon another, as they
make mutual purchases; now, as they have neither
stalls nor means, such a source of profit is
abolished.</p>

<p>“It is hard on such as me,” said a fruit-seller
to me, “to be driven away, for nothing that I’ve
done wrong as I knows of, and not let me make
a living, as I’ve been brought up to. I can’t
get no work at any of the markets. I’ve tried
Billingsgate and the Borough hard, but there is
so many poor men trying for a crust, they’re fit to
knock a new-comer’s head off, though if they did,
it wouldn’t be much matter. I had 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> stock-money,
and I sold the apples and a few pears I
had for 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and that 13<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> I’ve been spinning
out since I lost my pitch. But it’s done
now, and I haven’t had two meals a day for a
week and more&mdash;and them not to call meals&mdash;only
bread and coffee, or bread and a drink of
beer. I tried to get a round of customers, but
all the rounds was full, and I’m a very bad
walker, and a weak man too. My wife’s gone to
try the country&mdash;I don’t know where she is now.
I suppose I shall lose my lodging this week,
and then I must see what ‘the great house’ will
say to me. Perhaps they’ll give me nothing,
but take me in, and that’s hard on a man as
don’t want to be a pauper.”</p>

<p>Another man told me that he now paid 3<i>s.</i>
a week for privilege to stand with two stalls on
a space opposite the entrance into the National
Baths, New Cut; and that he and his wife, who
had stood for eleven years in the neighbourhood,
without a complaint against them, could hardly
get a crust.</p>

<p>One man, with a fruit-stall, assured me that
nine months ago he would not have taken 20<i>l.</i> for
his pitch, and now he was a “regular bankrupt.”
I asked a girl, who stood beside the kerb with
her load in front strapped round her loins, whether
her tray was heavy to carry. “After eight
hours at it,” she answered, “it swaggers me, like
drink.” The person whom I was with brought
to me two girls, who, he informed me, had been
forced to go upon the streets to gain a living.
Their stall on the Saturday night used to have
4<i>l.</i> worth of stock; but trade had grown so bad
since the New Police order, that after living on
their wares, they had taken to prostitution for a
living, rather than go to the “house.” The
ground in front of the shops has been bought up
by the costermongers at any price. Many now
give the tradesmen six shillings a week for a
stand, and one man pays as much as eight for
the right of pitching in front.</p>

<p>The applications for parochial relief, in consequence
of these removals, have been fewer
than was anticipated. In Lambeth parish, however,
about thirty families have been relieved, at
a cost of 50<i>l.</i> Strange to say, a quarter, or rather
more, of the very applicants for relief had been
furnished by the parish with money to start the
trade, their expulsion from which had driven
them to pauperism.</p>

<p>It consequently becomes a question for serious
consideration, whether any particular body of
householders should, for their own interest, convenience,
or pleasure, have it in their power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
deprive so many poor people of their only means
of livelihood, and so either force the rate-payers
to keep them as paupers, or else drive the women,
who object to the imprisonment of the Union, to
prostitution, and the men to theft&mdash;especially
when the very occupation which they are not
allowed to pursue, not only does no injury to
the neighbourhood, but is, on the contrary, the
means of attracting considerable custom to the
shops in the locality, and has, moreover, been
provided for them by the parish authorities as
a means of enabling them to get a living for
themselves.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Tricks of Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>I shall now treat of the tricks of trade practised
by the London costermongers. Of these the
costers speak with as little reserve and as little
shame as a fine gentleman of his peccadilloes.
“I’ve boiled lots of oranges,” chuckled one
man, “and sold them to Irish hawkers, as wasn’t
wide awake, for stunning big uns. The boiling
swells the oranges and so makes ’em look finer
ones, but it spoils them, for it takes out the
juice. People can’t find that out though until
it’s too late. I boiled the oranges only a few
minutes, and three or four dozen at a time.”
Oranges thus prepared will not keep, and any
unfortunate Irishwoman, tricked as were my
informant’s customers, is astonished to find her
stock of oranges turn dark-coloured and worthless
in forty-eight hours. The fruit is “cooked”
in this way for Saturday night and Sunday sale&mdash;times
at which the demand is the briskest.
Some prick the oranges and express the juice,
which they sell to the British wine-makers.</p>

<p>Apples cannot be dealt with like oranges, but
they are mixed. A cheap red-skinned fruit,
known to costers as “gawfs,” is rubbed hard, to
look bright and feel soft, and is mixed with
apples of a superior description. “Gawfs are
sweet and sour at once,” I was told, “and fit for
nothing but mixing.” Some foreign apples, from
Holland and Belgium, were bought very cheap
last March, at no more than 16<i>d.</i> a bushel, and
on a fine morning as many as fifty boys might
be seen rubbing these apples, in Hooper-street,
Lambeth. “I’ve made a crown out of a bushel
of ’em on a fine day,” said one sharp youth.
The larger apples are rubbed sometimes with a
piece of woollen cloth, or on the coat skirt, if
that appendage form part of the dress of the
person applying the friction, but most frequently
they are rolled in the palms of the hand. The
smaller apples are thrown to and fro in a sack,
a lad holding each end. “I wish I knew how
the shopkeepers manages <i>their</i> fruit,” said one
youth to me; “I should like to be up to some
of their moves; they do manage their things so
plummy.”</p>

<p>Cherries are capital for mixing, I was assured
by practical men. They purchase three sieves
of indifferent Dutch, and one sieve of good
English cherries, spread the English fruit over
the inferior quality, and sell them as the best.
Strawberry pottles are often half cabbage leaves,
a few tempting strawberries being displayed on
the top of the pottle. “Topping up,” said a
fruit dealer to me, “is the principal thing, and
we are perfectly justified in it. You ask any
coster that knows the world, and he’ll tell you
that all the salesmen in the markets tops up.
It’s only making the best of it.” Filberts they
bake to make them look brown and ripe.
Prunes they boil to give them a plumper and
finer appearance. The latter trick, however, is
not unusual in the shops.</p>

<p>The more honest costermongers will throw
away fish when it is unfit for consumption,
less scrupulous dealers, however, only throw
away what is utterly unsaleable; but none of
them fling away the dead eels, though their
prejudice against such dead fish prevents their
indulging in eel-pies. The dead eels are mixed
with the living, often in the proportion of 20 lb.
dead to 5 lb. alive, equal quantities of each being
accounted very fair dealing. “And after all,”
said a street fish dealer to me, “I don’t know
why dead eels should be objected to; the aristocrats
don’t object to them. Nearly all fish is
dead before it’s cooked, and why not eels? Why
not eat them when they’re sweet, if they’re ever
so dead, just as you eat fresh herrings? I believe
it’s only among the poor and among our
chaps, that there’s this prejudice. Eels die
quickly if they’re exposed to the sun.”</p>

<p>Herrings are made to look fresh and bright
by candle-light, by the lights being so disposed
“as to give them,” I was told, “a good reflection.
Why I can make them look splendid;
quite a pictur. I can do the same with mackerel,
but not so prime as herrings.”</p>

<p>There are many other tricks of a similar
kind detailed in the course of my narrative.
We should remember, however, that <i>shopkeepers</i>
are not immaculate in this respect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Kind and Quantities of Fish
sold by the London Costermongers.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Having now given the reader a general view of
the numbers, characters, habits, tastes, amusements,
language, opinions, earnings, and vicissitudes
of the London costermongers,&mdash;having described
their usual style of dress, diet, homes,
conveyances, and street-markets,&mdash;having explained
where their donkeys are bought, or
the terms on which they borrow them, their
barrows, their stock-money, and occasionally
their stock itself,&mdash;having shown their ordinary
mode of dealing, either in person or by deputy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
either at half-profits or by means of boys,&mdash;where
they go and how they manage on their
rounds in town and in the country,&mdash;what are
the laws affecting them, as well as the operation
of those laws upon the rest of the community,&mdash;having
done all this by way of giving the reader
a general knowledge of the street-sellers of fish,
fruit, and vegetables,&mdash;I now proceed to treat
more particularly of each of these classes
<i>seriatim</i>. Beginning with the street-fishmongers,
I shall describe, in due order, the season when,
the market where, and the classes of people by
whom, the wet-fish, the dry-fish, and the shell-fish
are severally sold and purchased in the
London streets, together with all other concomitant
circumstances.</p>

<p>The facilities of railway conveyance, by
means of which fish can be sent from the coast
to the capital with much greater rapidity, and
therefore be received much fresher than was
formerly the case, have brought large supplies
to London from places that before contributed
no quantity to the market, and so induced, as I
heard in all quarters at Billingsgate, an extraordinary
lowness of price in this species of diet.
This cheap food, through the agency of the
costermongers, is conveyed to every poor man’s
door, both in the thickly-crowded streets where
the poor reside&mdash;a family at least in a room&mdash;in
the vicinity of Drury-lane and of Whitechapel,
in Westminster, Bethnal-green, and St.
Giles’s, and through the long miles of the
suburbs. For all low-priced fish the poor are the
costermongers’ best customers, and a fish diet
seems becoming almost as common among the
ill-paid classes of London, as is a potato diet
among the peasants of Ireland. Indeed, now,
the fish season of the poor never, or rarely, knows
an interruption. If fresh herrings are not in the
market, there are sprats; and if not sprats, there
are soles, or whitings, or mackarel, or plaice.</p>

<p>The rooms of the very neediest of our needy
metropolitan population, always smell of fish;
most frequently of herrings. So much so,
indeed, that to those who, like myself, have
been in the habit of visiting their dwellings, the
smell of herrings, even in comfortable homes,
savours from association, so strongly of squalor
and wretchedness, as to be often most oppressive.
The volatile oil of the fish seems to
hang about the walls and beams of the rooms
for ever. Those who have experienced the smell
of fish only in a well-ordered kitchen, can form
no adequate notion of this stench, in perhaps a
dilapidated and ill-drained house, and in a
rarely-cleaned room; and I have many a time
heard both husband and wife&mdash;one couple especially,
who were “sweating” for a gorgeous
clothes’ emporium&mdash;say that they had not time
to be clean.</p>

<p>The costermonger supplies the poor with
every kind of fish, for he deals, usually, in
every kind when it is cheap. Some confine
their dealings to such things as shrimps, or
periwinkles, but the adhering to one particular
article is the exception and not the rule; while
shrimps, lobsters, &amp;c., are rarely bought by the
very poor. Of the entire quantity of fish sent
to Billingsgate-market, the costermongers, stationary
and itinerant, may be said to sell one-third,
taking one kind with another.</p>

<p>The fish sent to London is known to Billingsgate
salesmen as “red” and “white” fish. The
red fish is, as regards the metropolitan mart,
confined to the salmon. The other descriptions
are known as “white.” The costermongers
classify the fish they vend as “wet”
and “dry.” All fresh fish is “wet;” all
cured or salted fish, “dry.” The fish which
is sold “pickled,” is known by that appellation,
but its street sale is insignificant. The principal
fish-staple, so to speak of the street-fishmonger,
is soles, which are in supply all, or nearly all,
the year. The next are herrings, mackarel,
whitings, Dutch eels, and plaice. The trade in
plaice and sprats is almost entirely in the
hands of the costermongers; their sale of
shrimps is nearer a half than a third of the
entire quantity sent to Billingsgate; but their
purchase of cod, or of the best lobsters, or crabs,
is far below a third. The costermonger rarely
buys turbot, or brill, or even salmon, unless
he can retail it at 6<i>d.</i> the pound. When it
is at that price, a street salmon-seller told me
that the eagerness to buy it was extreme. He
had known persons, who appeared to him to
be very poor, buy a pound of salmon, “just for
a treat once in a way.” His best, or rather
readiest customers&mdash;for at 6<i>d.</i> a pound all
classes of the community may be said to be his
purchasers&mdash;were the shopkeepers of the busier
parts, and the occupants of the smaller private
houses of the suburbs. During the past year
salmon was scarce and dear, and the costermongers
bought, comparatively, none of it. In
a tolerably cheap season they do not sell more
than from a fifteenth to a twentieth of the quantity
received at Billingsgate.</p>

<p>In order to be able to arrive at the quantity
or weight of the several kinds of fish sold by
the costermongers in the streets of London, it is
necessary that we should know the entire
amount sent to Billingsgate-market, for it is
only by estimating the proportion which the
street-sale bears to the whole, that we can
attain even an approximation to the truth.
The following Table gives the results of certain
information collected by myself for the first
time, I believe, in this country. The facts,
as well as the estimated proportions of each
kind of fish sold by the costermongers, have
been furnished me by the most eminent of the
Billingsgate salesmen&mdash;gentlemen to whom I
am under many obligations for their kindness,
consideration, and assistance, at all times and
seasons.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Costermongers’ Fish Season.</span></h3>

<p>The season for the street-fishmongers begins
about October and ends in May.</p>

<p>In October, or a month or two earlier, may-be,
they generally deal in fresh herrings, the supply
of which lasts up to about the middle or end of
November. This is about the best season. The
herrings are sold to the poor, upon an average,
at twelve a groat, or from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> the hundred.
After or during November, the sprat and plaice
season begins. The regular street-fishmonger,
however, seldom deals in sprats. He “works”
these only when there is no other fish to be got.
He generally considers this trade beneath him,
and more fit for women than men. Those costers
who do sell them dispose of them now by weight
at the rate of 1<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> the pound&mdash;a bushel averaging
from 40 to 50 pounds. The plaice season
continues to the first or second week in May. During
May the casualty season is on, and there is
little fish certain from that time till salmon
comes in, and this is about the end of the month.
The salmon season lasts till about the middle of
July. The selling of salmon is a bad trade in
the poor districts, but a very good one in the
better streets or the suburbs. At this work the
street-fishmonger will sometimes earn on a fine
day from 5<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> The losses, however, are
very great in this article if the weather prove
bad. If kept at all “over” it loses its colour,
and turns to a pale red, which is seen immediately
the knife goes into the fish. While I was
obtaining this information some months back, a
man went past the window of the house in which
I was seated, with a barrow drawn by a donkey.
He was crying, “Fresh cod, oh! 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound,
cod alive, oh!” My informant called me to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
window, saying, “Now, here is what we call
rough cod.” He told me it was three days old.
He thought it was eatable <i>then</i>, he said. The
eyes were dull and heavy and sunken, and the
limp tails of the fish dangled over the ends of the
barrow. He said it was a hanging market that
day&mdash;that is to say, things had been dear, and
the costers couldn’t pay the price for them. He
should fancy, he told me, the man had paid for
the fish from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> each, which was at the
rate of 1<i>d.</i> per pound. He was calling them at
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> He would not take less than this until he
had “got his own money in;” and then, probably,
if he had one or two of the fish left, he would
put up with 1<i>d.</i> per pound. The weight he was
“working” was 12 oz. to the pound. My informant
assured me he knew this, because he had
borrowed <i>his</i> 12 oz. pound weight that morning.
This, with the draught of 2 oz. in the weighing-machine,
and the ounce gained by placing the
fish at the end of the pan, would bring the actual
weight given to 9 oz. per pound, and probably,
he said the man had even a lighter pound weight
in his barrow ready for a “scaly” customer.</p>

<p>After the street-fishmonger has done his
morning’s work, he sometimes goes out with
his tub of pickled salmon on a barrow or stall,
and sells it in saucers at 1<i>d.</i> each, or by the
piece. This he calls as “fine Newcastle salmon.”
There is generally a great sale for this at the
races; and if country-people begin with a pennyworth
they end with a shillingsworth&mdash;a pennyworth,
the costers say, makes a fool of the mouth.
If they have any on hand, and a little stale, at
the end of the week, they sell it at the public-houses
to the “Lushingtons,” and to them, with
plenty of vinegar, it goes down sweet. It is generally
bought for 7<i>s.</i> a kit, a little bit “pricked;”
but, if good, the price is from 12<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> “We’re
in no ways particular to that,” said one candid
coster to me. “We don’t have the eating on it
ourselves, and people a’n’t always got their taste,
especially when they have been drinking, and we
sell a great deal to parties in that way. We
think it no sin to cheat ’em of 1<i>d.</i> while the publicans
takes 1<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>Towards the middle of June the street-fishmonger
looks for mackerel, and he is generally
employed in selling this fish up to the
end of July. After July the Billingsgate season
is said to be finished. From this time to the
middle of October, when the herrings return,
he is mostly engaged selling dried haddocks and
red herrings, and other “cas’alty fish that may
come across him.” Many of the street-fishmongers
object to deal in periwinkles, or stewed
mussels, or boiled whelks, because, being accustomed
to take their money in sixpences at a time,
they do not like, they say, to traffic in halfpennyworths.
The dealers in these articles are generally
looked upon as an inferior class.</p>

<p>There are, during the day, two periods for the
sale of street-fish&mdash;the one (the morning trade)
beginning about ten, and lasting till one in the
day&mdash;and the other (the night trade) lasting from
six in the evening up to ten at night. What fish
is left in the forenoon is generally disposed of
cheap at night. That sold at the latter time is
generally used by the working-class for supper,
or kept by them with a little salt in a cool place
for the next day’s dinner, if it will last as long.
Several articles are sold by the street-fishmonger
chiefly by night. These are oysters, lobsters,
pickled salmon, stewed mussels, and the like.
The reason why the latter articles sell better
by night is, my informant says, “Because
people are lofty-minded, and don’t like to be
seen eating on ’em in the street in the day-time.”
Shrimps and winkles are the staple commodities
of the afternoon trade, which lasts from three to
half-past five in the evening. These articles are
generally bought by the working-classes for their
tea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Billingsgate.</span></h3>

<p>To see this market in its busiest costermonger
time, the visitor should be there about seven
o’clock on a Friday morning. The market opens
at four, but for the first two or three hours,
it is attended solely by the regular fishmongers
and “bummarees” who have the pick of the
best there. As soon as these are gone, the
costers’ sale begins.</p>

<p>Many of the costers that usually deal in
vegetables, buy a little fish on the Friday. It
is the fast day of the Irish, and the mechanics’
wives run short of money at the end of the
week, and so make up their dinners with fish;
for this reason the attendance of costers’ barrows
at Billingsgate on a Friday morning is
always very great. As soon as you reach the
Monument you see a line of them, with one or
two tall fishmonger’s carts breaking the uniformity,
and the din of the cries and commotion
of the distant market, begins to break on the ear
like the buzzing of a hornet’s nest. The whole
neighbourhood is covered with the hand-barrows,
some laden with baskets, others with sacks. Yet
as you walk along, a fresh line of costers’ barrows
are creeping in or being backed into almost impossible
openings; until at every turning nothing
but donkeys and rails are to be seen. The morning
air is filled with a kind of seaweedy odour,
reminding one of the sea-shore; and on entering
the market, the smell of fish, of whelks, red
herrings, sprats, and a hundred others, is almost
overpowering.</p>

<p>The wooden barn-looking square where the
fish is sold, is soon after six o’clock crowded with
shiny cord jackets and greasy caps. Everybody
comes to Billingsgate in his worst clothes,
and no one knows the length of time a coat can
be worn until they have been to a fish sale.
Through the bright opening at the end are
seen the tangled rigging of the oyster-boats
and the red worsted caps of the sailors. Over
the hum of voices is heard the shouts of the
salesmen, who, with their white aprons, peering
above the heads of the mob, stand on their
tables, roaring out their prices.</p>

<p>All are bawling together&mdash;salesmen and hucksters
of provisions, capes, hardware, and newspapers&mdash;till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the place is a perfect Babel of competition.
“Ha-a-ansome cod! best in the
market! All alive! alive! alive O!” “Ye-o-o!
Ye-o-o! here’s your fine Yarmouth bloaters!
Who’s the buyer?” “Here you are, governor,
splendid whiting! some of the right sort!”
“Turbot! turbot! all alive! turbot!” “Glass of
nice peppermint! this cold morning a ha’penny
a glass!” “Here you are at your own price!
Fine soles, O!” “Oy! oy! oy! Now’s your
time! fine grizzling sprats! all large and no
small!” “Hullo! hullo here! beautiful lobsters!
good and cheap! fine cock crabs all alive
O!” “Five brill and one turbot&mdash;have that
lot for a pound! Come and look at ’em, governor;
you wont see a better sample in the
market.” “Here, this way! this way for splendid
skate! skate O! skate O!” “Had&mdash;had&mdash;had&mdash;had&mdash;haddick!
all fresh and good!”
“Currant and meat puddings! a ha’penny
each!” “Now, you mussel-buyers, come
along! come along! come along! now’s your
time for fine fat mussels!” “Here’s food for
the belly, and clothes for the back, but I sell
food for the mind” (shouts the newsvender).
“Here’s smelt O!” “Here ye are, fine Finney
haddick!” “Hot soup! nice peas-soup! a-all
hot! hot!” “Ahoy! ahoy here! live plaice!
all alive O!” “Now or never! whelk! whelk!
whelk!” “Who’ll buy brill O! brill O!”
“Capes! water-proof capes! sure to keep the
wet out! a shilling a piece!” “Eels O! eels O!
Alive! alive O!” “Fine flounders, a shilling
a lot! Who’ll have this prime lot of flounders?”
“Shrimps! shrimps! fine shrimps!”
“Wink! wink! wink!” “Hi! hi-i! here you
are, just eight eels left, only eight!” “O ho!
O ho! this way&mdash;this way&mdash;this way! Fish
alive! alive! alive O!”</p>

<p>In the darkness of the shed, the white bellies
of the turbots, strung up bow-fashion, shine like
mother-of-pearl, while, the lobsters, lying upon
them, look intensely scarlet, from the contrast.
Brown baskets piled up on one another, and
with the herring-scales glittering like spangles
all over them, block up the narrow paths.
Men in coarse canvas jackets, and bending under
huge hampers, push past, shouting “Move on!
move on, there!” and women, with the long limp
tails of cod-fish dangling from their aprons, elbow
their way through the crowd. Round the auction-tables
stand groups of men turning over
the piles of soles, and throwing them down till
they slide about in their slime; some are smelling
them, while others are counting the lots.
“There, that lot of soles are worth your money,”
cries the salesman to one of the crowd as he
moves on leisurely; “none better in the market.
You shall have ’em for a pound and half-a-crown.”
“Oh!” shouts another salesman, “it’s
no use to bother him&mdash;he’s no go.” Presently
a tall porter, with a black oyster-bag, staggers
past, trembling under the weight of his load,
his back and shoulders wet with the drippings
from the sack. “Shove on one side!” he mutters
from between his clenched teeth, as he forces
his way through the mob. Here is a tray of
reddish-brown shrimps piled up high, and the
owner busy sifting his little fish into another
stand, while a doubtful customer stands in front,
tasting the flavour of the stock and consulting
with his companion in speculation. Little
girls carrying matting-bags, that they have
brought from Spitalfields, come up, and ask you
in a begging voice to buy their baskets; and
women with bundles of twigs for stringing herrings,
cry out, “Half-penny a bunch!” from all
sides. Then there are blue-black piles of small
live lobsters, moving about their bound-up
claws and long “feelers,” one of them occasionally
being taken up by a looker-on, and
dashed down again, like a stone. Everywhere
every one is asking, “What’s the price,
master?” while shouts of laughter from round
the stalls of the salesmen, bantering each other,
burst out, occasionally, over the murmuring
noise of the crowd. The transparent smelts
on the marble-slabs, and the bright herrings,
with the lump of transparent ice magnifying
their eyes like a lens, are seldom looked at
until the market is over, though the hampers
and piles of huge maids, dropping slime from
the counter, are eagerly examined and bartered
for.</p>

<p>One side of the market is set apart for
whelks. There they stand in sackfulls, with
the yellow shells piled up at the mouth, and
one or two of the fish, curling out like corkscrews,
placed as a sample. The coster slips
one of these from its shell, examines it, pushes
it back again, and then passes away, to look
well round the market. In one part the stones
are covered with herring-barrels, packed closely
with dried fish, and yellow heaps of stiff haddock
rise up on all sides. Here a man walks
up with his knot on his shoulder, waiting for a
job to carry fish to the trucks. Boys in ragged
clothes, who have slept during the night under
a railway-arch, clamour for employment; while
the heads of those returning from the oyster-boats,
rise slowly up the stone sides of the
wharf.</p>

<p>The costermongers have nicknamed the long
row of oyster boats moored close alongside the
wharf “Oyster-street.” On looking down the
line of tangled ropes and masts, it seems as
though the little boats would sink with the crowds
of men and women thronged together on their
decks. It is as busy a scene as one can well
behold. Each boat has its black sign-board,
and salesman in his white apron walking up
and down “his shop,” and on each deck is a
bright pewter pot and tin-covered plate, the
remains of the salesman’s breakfast. “Who’s for
Baker’s?” “Who’s for Archer’s?” “Who’ll have
Alston’s?” shout the oyster-merchants, and the
red cap of the man in the hold bobs up and
down as he rattles the shells about with his
spade. These holds are filled with oysters&mdash;a
gray mass of sand and shell&mdash;on which is a bushel
measure well piled up in the centre, while some
of them have a blue muddy heap of mussels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
divided off from the “natives.” The sailors in
their striped guernseys sit on the boat sides
smoking their morning’s pipe, allowing themselves
to be tempted by the Jew boys with cloth
caps, old shoes, and silk handkerchiefs. Lads
with bundles of whips skip from one boat to
another, and, seedy-looking mechanics, with
handfuls of tin fancy goods, hover about the
salesmen, who are the principal supporters of
this trade. The place has somewhat the
appearance of a little Holywell-street; for the
old clothes’ trade is entirely in the hands of
the Jew boys, and coats, caps, hats, umbrellas,
and old shoes, are shouted out in a rich nasal
twang on all sides.</p>

<p>Passing by a man and his wife who were
breakfasting on the stone coping, I went to the
shore where the watermen ply for passengers to
the eel boats. Here I found a crowd of punts,
half filled with flounders, and small closely-packed
baskets of them ranged along the seats.
The lads, who act as jacks-in-the-water, were
busy feeling in the mud for the fish that had
fallen over board, little caring for the water that
dashed over their red swollen feet. Presently a
boat, piled up with baskets, shot in, grazing the
bottom, and men and women, blue with the cold
morning air, stepped out.</p>

<p>The Dutch built eel-boats, with their bulging
polished oak sides, were half-hidden in the river
mist. They were surrounded by skiffs, that ply
from the Surrey and Middlesex shores, and
wait whilst the fares buy their fish. The holds
of these eel-boats are fitted up with long tanks of
muddy water, and the heads of the eels are seen
breathing on the surface&mdash;a thick brown bubble
rising slowly, and floating to the sides. Wooden
sabots and large porcelain pipes are ranged
round the ledges, and men in tall fur caps with
high cheek bones, and rings in their ears, walk
the decks. At the stern of one boat was moored
a coffin-shaped barge pierced with holes, and
hanging in the water were baskets, shaped like
olive jars&mdash;both to keep the stock of fish alive
and fresh. In the centre of the boat stood the
scales,&mdash;a tall heavy apparatus, one side fitted up
with the conical net-bag to hold the eels, and
the other with the weights, and pieces of stone
to make up for the extra draught of the water
hanging about the fish. When a skiff load of
purchasers arrives, the master Dutchman takes
his hands from his pockets, lays down his pipe,
and seizing a sort of long-handled landing-net
scoops from the tank a lot of eels. The purchasers
examine them, and try to beat down the
price. “You calls them eels do you?” said a man
with his bag ready opened. “Yeas,” answered
the Dutchman without any show of indignation.
“Certainly, there is a few among them,” continued
the customer; and after a little more of this
kind of chaffering the bargain is struck.</p>

<p>The visitors to the eel-boats were of all
grades; one was a neatly-dressed girl to whom
the costers showed the utmost gallantry, calling
her “my dear,” and helping her up the shining
sides of the boat; and many of the men had on
their blue serge apron, but these were only
where the prices were high. The greatest crowd
of customers is in the heavy barge alongside
of the Dutch craft. Here a stout sailor in his
red woollen shirt, and canvass petticoat, is surrounded
by the most miserable and poorest of
fish purchasers&mdash;the men with their crushed
hats, tattered coats, and unshorn chins, and the
women with their pads on their bonnets, and
brown ragged gowns blowing in the breeze. One,
in an old table-cover shawl, was beating her
palms together before the unmoved Dutchman,
fighting for an abatement, and showing her
stock of halfpence. Others were seated round
the barge, sorting their lots in their shallows,
and sanding the fish till they were quite yellow.
Others, again, were crowding round the scales
narrowly watching the balance, and then begging
for a few dead eels to make up any doubtful
weight.</p>

<p>As you walk back from the shore to the
market, you see small groups of men and
women dividing the lot of fish they have bought
together. At one basket, a coster, as you pass,
calls to you, and says, “Here, master, just put
these three halfpence on these three cod, and
obleege a party.” The coins are placed, and
each one takes the fish his coin is on; and so
there is no dispute.</p>

<p>At length nearly all the busy marketing has
finished, and the costers hurry to breakfast. At
one house, known as “Rodway’s Coffee-house,”
a man can have a meal for 1<i>d.</i>&mdash;a mug of hot
coffee and two slices of bread and butter, while for
two-pence what is elegantly termed “a tightner,”
that is to say, a most plentiful repast, may
be obtained. Here was a large room, with tables
all round, and so extremely silent, that the smacking
of lips and sipping of coffee were alone heard.
Upwards of 1,500 men breakfast here in the
course of the morning, many of them taking as
many as three such meals. On the counter was
a pile of white mugs, and the bright tin cans
stood beside the blazing fire, whilst Rodway
himself sat at a kind of dresser, cutting up and
buttering the bread, with marvellous rapidity.
It was a clean, orderly, and excellent establishment,
kept by a man, I was told, who had risen
from a saloop stall.</p>

<p>Opposite to the Coal Exchange were ranged
the stalls and barrows with the street eatables,
and the crowds round each showed the effects of
the sharp morning air. One&mdash;a Jew’s&mdash;had hot-pies
with lids that rose as the gravy was poured
in from an oil can; another carried a stone jar of
peppermint-water, at &frac12;<i>d.</i> a glass; and the pea-soup
stand was hemmed in by boys and men
blowing the steam from their cups. Beside
these were Jews with cloth caps and knives, and
square yellow cakes; one old man, in a corner,
stood examining a thread-bare scarf that
a cravatless coster had handed to him. Coffee-stalls
were in great plenty; and men left their
barrows to run up and have “an oyster,” or
“an ’ot heel.” One man here makes his living
by selling sheets of old newspapers, at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for the costers to dress their trays with. Though
seemingly rather out of place, there was a Mosaic
jewellery stand; old umbrellas, too, were far from
scarce; and one had brought a horse-hair stool
for sale.</p>

<p>Everybody was soon busy laying out their
stock. The wrinkled dull-eyed cod was freshened
up, the red-headed gurnet placed in rows, the
eels prevented from writhing over the basket
sides by cabbage-leaves, and the soles paired off
like gloves. Then the little trucks began to
leave, crawling, as it were, between the legs of the
horses in the vans crowding Thames-street, and
plunging in between huge waggons, but still appearing
safely on the other side; and the 4,000
costers who visit Billingsgate on the Friday
morning were shortly scattered throughout the
metropolis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Forestalling of Markets and
the Billingsgate Bummarees.</span></h3>

<p>“Forestalling,” writes Adam Smith, “is the
buying or contracting for any cattle, provisions,
or merchandize, on its way to the market (or at
market), or dissuading persons from buying their
goods there, or persuading them to raise the
price, or spreading any false rumour with intent
to enhance the value of any article. In the
remoter periods of our history several statutes
were passed, prohibiting forestalling under severe
penalties; but as more enlarged views upon
such subjects began to prevail, their impolicy
became obvious, and they were consequently
repealed in 1772. But forestalling is still
punishable by fine and imprisonment; though
it be doubtful whether any jury would now
convict an individual accused of such practices.”</p>

<p>In Billingsgate the “forestallers” or middlemen
are known as “bummarees,” who, as
regards means, are a far superior class to the
“hagglers” (the forestallers of the “green”
markets). The bummaree is the jobber or speculator
on the fish-exchange. Perhaps on every
busy morning 100 men buy a quantity of fish,
which they account likely to be remunerative,
and retail it, or dispose of it in lots to the fishmongers
or costermongers. Few if any of these
dealers, however, are merely bummarees. A
salesman, if he have disposed of the fish consigned
to himself, will turn bummaree if any bargain
tempt him. Or a fishmonger may purchase
twice the quantity he requires for his own
trade, in order to procure a cheaper stock, and
“bummaree” what he does not require. These
speculations in fish are far more hazardous than
those in fruit or vegetables, for later in the day
a large consignment by railway may reach Billingsgate,
and, being thrown upon the market,
may reduce the price one half. In the vegetable
and fruit markets there is but one arrival.
The costermongers are among the best customers
of the bummarees.</p>

<p>I asked several parties as to the origin of
the word “bummaree,” and how long it had
been in use. “Why, bless your soul, sir,”
said one Billingsgate labourer, “there always
was bummarees, and there always will be; just
as Jack there is a ‘rough,’ and I’m a blessed
‘bobber.’” One man assured me it was a French
name; another that it was Dutch. A fishmonger,
to whom I was indebted for information,
told me he thought that the bummaree
was originally a bum-boat man, who purchased
of the wind-bound smacks at Gravesend or the
Nore, and sent the fish up rapidly to the market
by land.</p>

<p>I may add, as an instance of the probable
gains of the forestallers, in the olden time, that
a tradesman whose family had been long connected
with Billingsgate, showed me by his predecessors’
books and memoranda, that in the
depth of winter, when the Thames was perhaps
choked with ice, and no supply of fish “got up”
to London, any, that might, by management,
reach Billingsgate used to command exorbitant
prices. To speak only of the present century:
March 11th, 1802, a cod fish (8 lbs.) was bought
by Messrs. Phillips and Robertson, fishmongers,
Bond-street, for 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> February, 1809, a salmon
(19 lbs.) was bought by Mr. Phillips at a guinea
a pound, 19<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> for the fish! March 24th,
1824, three lobsters were sold for a guinea each.</p>

<p>The “haggler,” I may here observe, is the
bummaree or forestaller or middleman of the green
markets; as far as the costermonger’s trade is
concerned, he deals in fruit and vegetables. Of
these trafficers there are fully 200 in Covent-garden-market;
from 60 to 70 in Farringdon;
from 40 to 50 in the Borough; from 50 to 60
in Spitalfields; and none in Portman-market;
such being the only wholesale green-markets
for the purposes of the costermongers. The
haggler is a middleman who makes his purchases
of the growers when the day is somewhat
advanced, and the whole produce conveyed
to the market has not been disposed of.
The grower will then, rather than be detained
in town, sell the whole lot remaining in his
cart or wagon to a haggler, who re-sells it to
the costers, or to any other customer, from a
stand which he hires by the day. The costermongers
who are the most provident, and
either have means or club their resources for a
large purchase, often buy early in the morning,
and so have the advantage of anticipating their
fellows in the street-trade, with the day before
them. Those who buy later are the customers
of the hagglers, and are street-sellers, whose
means do not command an extensive purchase,
or who do not care to venture upon one unless
it be very cheap. These men speak very bitterly
of the hagglers, calling them “cracked-up shop-keepers”
and “scurfs,” and declaring that but
for them the growers must remain, and sell off
their produce cheap to the costermongers.</p>

<p>A species of forestalling is now not uncommon,
and is on the increase among the costermongers
themselves. There are four men,
having the command of money, who attend
the markets and buy either fish or vegetables
largely. One man especially buys almost daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as much fruit and vegetables as will supply
thirty street-dealers. He adds 3<i>d.</i> a bushel
to the wholesale market price of apples; 6<i>d.</i>
to that of pears; 9<i>d.</i> to plums; and 1<i>s.</i> to
cherries. A purchaser can thus get a smaller
quantity than he can always buy at market,
and avails himself of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Moreover, a good many of the more intelligent
street-dealers now club together&mdash;six of them,
for instance&mdash;contributing 15<i>s.</i> each, and a quantity
of fish is thus bought by one of their body (a
smaller contribution suffices to buy vegetables).
Perhaps, on an equal partition, each man thus
gets for his 15<i>s.</i> as much as might have cost him
20<i>s.</i>, had he bought “single-handed.” This
mode of purchase is also on the increase.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Wet” Fish-sellers in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Concerning the sale of “wet” or fresh fish, I
had the following account from a trustworthy
man, of considerable experience and superior
education:</p>

<p>“I have sold ‘wet fish’ in the streets for more
than fourteen years,” he said; “before that I
was a gentleman, and was brought up a gentleman,
if I’m a beggar now. I bought fish largely
in the north of England once, and now I must
sell it in the streets of London. Never mind
talking about that, sir; there’s some things
won’t bear talking about. There’s a wonderful
difference in the streets since I knew them first;
I could make a pound then, where I can hardly
make a crown now. People had more money,
and less meanness then. I consider that the railways
have injured me, and all wet fish-sellers, to
a great extent. Fish now, you see, sir, comes in
at all hours, so that nobody can calculate on the
quantity that will be received&mdash;nobody. That’s
the mischief of it; we are afraid to buy, and miss
many a chance of turning a penny. In my time,
since railways were in, I’ve seen cod-fish sold at
a guinea in the morning that were a shilling at
noon; for either the wind and the tide had
served, or else the railway fishing-places were
more than commonly supplied, and there was a
glut to London. There’s no trade requires
greater judgment than mine&mdash;none whatever.
Before the railways&mdash;and I never could see the
good of them&mdash;the fish came in by the tide, and
we knew how to buy, for there would be no more
till next tide. Now, we don’t know. I go to
Billingsgate to buy my fish, and am very well
known to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (mentioning
the names of some well-known salesmen). The
Jews are my ruin there now. When I go to
Billingsgate, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; will say, or rather, I
will say to him, ‘How much for this pad of
soles?’ He will answer, ‘Fourteen shillings.’
‘Fourteen shillings!’ I say, ‘I’ll give you seven
shillings,&mdash;that’s the proper amount;’ then
the Jew boys&mdash;none of them twenty that are
there&mdash;ranged about will begin; and one says,
when I bid 7<i>s.</i>, ‘I’ll give 8<i>s</i>;’ ‘nine,’ says
another, close on my left; ‘ten,’ shouts another,
on my right, and so they go offering on; at last
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; says to one of them, as grave as a
judge, ‘Yours, sir, at 13<i>s</i>,’ but it’s all gammon.
The 13<i>s.</i> buyer isn’t a buyer at all, and isn’t
required to pay a farthing, and never touches
the goods. It’s all done to keep up the price to
poor fishmen, and so to poor buyers that are
our customers in the streets. Money makes
money, and it don’t matter how. Those Jew
boys&mdash;I dare say they’re the same sort as once
sold oranges about the streets&mdash;are paid, I know
1<i>s.</i> for spending three or four hours that way in
the cold and wet. My trade has been injured,
too, by the great increase of Irish costermongers;
for an Irishman will starve out an
Englishman any day; besides if a tailor can’t
live by his trade, he’ll take to fish, or fruit
and cabbages. The month of May is a fine
season for plaice, which is bought very largely
by my customers. Plaice are sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i> and
1<i>d.</i> a piece. It is a difficult fish to manage, and
in poor neighbourhoods an important one to
manage well. The old hands make a profit out
of it; new hands a loss. There’s not much
cod or other wet fish sold to the poor, while plaice
is in. My customers are poor men’s wives,&mdash;mechanics,
I fancy. They want fish at most
unreasonable prices. If I could go and pull them
off a line flung off Waterloo-bridge, and no other
expense, I couldn’t supply them as cheap as they
expect them. Very cheap fish-sellers lose their
customers, through the Billingsgate bummarees,
for they have pipes, and blow up the cod-fish,
most of all, and puff up their bellies till they
are twice the size, but when it comes to table,
there’s hardly to say any fish at all. The Billingsgate
authorities would soon stop it, if they
knew all I know. They won’t allow any roguery,
or any trick, if they only come to hear of it.
These bummarees have caused many respectable
people to avoid street-buying, and so fair traders
like me are injured. I’ve nothing to complain of
about the police. Oft enough, if I could be allowed
ten minutes longer on a Saturday night,
I could get through all my stock without loss.
About a quarter to twelve I begin to halloo away
as hard as I can, and there’s plenty of customers
that lay out never a farthing till that time, and
then they can’t be served fast enough, so they
get their fish cheaper than I do. If any halloos
out that way sooner, we must all do the same.
Anything rather than keep fish over a warm
Sunday. I have kept mine in ice; I haven’t
opportunity now, but it’ll keep in a cool place
this time of year. I think there’s as many
sellers as buyers in the streets, and there’s scores
of them don’t give just weight or measure. I
wish there was good moral rules in force, and
everybody gave proper weight. I often talk to
street-dealers about it. I’ve given them many a
lecture; but they say they only do what plenty
of shopkeepers do, and just get fined and go on
again, without being a pin the worse thought of.
They are abusive sometimes, too; I mean the
street-sellers are, because they are ignorant. I
have no children, thank God, and my wife helps
me in my business. Take the year through, I
clear from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> every week. That’s not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
much to support two people. Some weeks I earn
only 4<i>s.</i>,&mdash;such as in wet March weather. In
others I earn 18<i>s.</i> or 1<i>l.</i> November, December,
and January are good months for me. I wouldn’t
mind if they lasted all the year round. I’m
often very badly off indeed&mdash;very badly; and
the misery of being hard up, sir, is not when
you’re making a struggle to get out of your
trouble; no, nor to raise a meal off herrings that
you’ve given away once, but when your wife and
you’s sitting by a grate without a fire, and putting
the candle out to save it, a planning how to
raise money. ‘Can we borrow there?’ ‘Can
we manage to sell if we can borrow?’ ‘Shall
we get from very bad to the parish?’ Then,
perhaps, there’s a day lost, and without a bite in
our mouths trying to borrow. Let alone a little
drop to give a body courage, which perhaps is
the only good use of spirit after all. That’s the
pinch, sir. When the rain you hear outside puts
you in mind of drownding!”</p>

<p>Subjoined is the amount (in round numbers)
of wet fish annually disposed of in the metropolis
by the street-sellers:</p>

</table></div>

<p>From the above Table we perceive that the fish,
of which the greatest quantity is eaten by the
poor, is herrings; of this, compared with plaice
there is upwards of thirty times the number
consumed. After plaice rank mackerel, and of
these the consumption is about one-half less in
number than plaice, while the number of soles
vended in the streets, is again half of that of
mackerel. Then come whiting, which are
about two-thirds the number of the soles, while
the consumption to the poor of haddock, cod,
eels, and salmon, is comparatively insignificant.
Of sprats, which are estimated by weight, only
one-fifth of the number of pounds are consumed
compared with the weight of mackerel. The
pounds’ weight of herrings sold in the streets, in
the course of a year, is upwards of seven times
that of plaice, and fourteen times that of
mackerel. Altogether more than 260,000,000
pounds, or 116,000 tons weight of wet fish are
yearly purchased in the streets of London, for
the consumption of the humbler classes. Of
this aggregate amount, no less than five-sixths
consists of herrings; which, indeed, constitute
the great slop diet of the metropolis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Sprat-selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Sprats&mdash;one of the cheapest and most grateful
luxuries of the poor&mdash;are generally introduced
about the 9th of November. Indeed “Lord
Mayor’s day” is sometimes called “sprat day.”
They continue in about ten weeks. They are
sold at Billingsgate by the “toss,” or “chuck,”
which is about half a bushel, and weighs from
40lbs. to 50lbs. The price varies from 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>
Sprats are, this season, pronounced remarkably
fine. “Look at my lot sir,” said a street-seller
to me; “they’re a heap of new silver,” and the
bright shiny appearance of the glittering little
fish made the comparison not inappropriate.
In very few, if in any, instances does a
costermonger confine himself to the sale of
sprats, unless his means limit him to that one
branch of the business. A more prosperous
street-fishmonger will sometimes detach the
sprats from his stall, and his wife, or one of his
children will take charge of them. Only a few
sprat-sellers are itinerant, the fish being usually
sold by stationary street-sellers at “pitches.”
One who worked his sprats through the streets,
or sold them from a stall as he thought best,
gave me the following account. He was dressed
in a newish fustian-jacket, buttoned close up his
chest, but showing a portion of a clean cotton
shirt at the neck, with a bright-coloured coarse
handkerchief round it; the rest of his dress was
covered by a white apron. His hair, as far as I
could see it under his cloth cap, was carefully
brushed, and (it appeared) as carefully oiled.
At the first glance I set him down as having
been a gentleman’s servant. He had a somewhat
deferential, though far from cringing
manner with him, and seemed to be about
twenty-five or twenty-six&mdash;he thought he was
older, he said, but did not know his age exactly.</p>

<p>“Ah! sir,” he began, in a tone according with
his look, “sprats <i>is</i> a blessing to the poor.
Fresh herrings is a blessing too, and sprats is
young herrings, and is a blessing in ’portion”
[for so he pronounced what seemed to be a
favourite word with him “proportion”]. “It’s
only four years&mdash;yes, four, I’m sure of that&mdash;since
I walked the streets starving, in the depth
of winter, and looked at the sprats, and said, I
wish I could fill my belly off you. Sir, I hope
it was no great sin, but I could hardly keep my
hands from stealing some and eating them raw.
If they make me sick, thought I, the police’ll
take care of me, and that’ll be something.
While these thoughts was a passing through my
mind, I met a man who was a gentleman’s
coachman; I knew him a little formerly, and so
I stopped him and told him who I was, and that
I hadn’t had a meal for two days. ‘Well, by
G&mdash;,’ said the coachman, ‘you look like it,
why I shouldn’t have known you. Here’s a
shilling.’ And then he went on a little way, and
then stopped, and turned back and thrust 3&frac12;<i>d.</i>
more into my hand, and bolted off. I’ve never
seen him since. But I’m grateful to him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
same ’portion (proportion) as if I had. After I’d
had a penn’orth of bread and a penn’orth of
cheese, and half-a-pint of beer, I felt a new man,
and I went to the party as I’d longed to steal
the sprats from, and told him what I’d thought
of. I can’t say what made me tell him, but
it turned out for good. I don’t know much
about religion, though I can read a little, but
may be that had something to do with it.”
The rest of the man’s narrative was&mdash;briefly
told&mdash;as follows. He was the only child of
a gentleman’s coachman. His father had deserted
his mother and him, and gone abroad, he
believed, with some family. His mother, however,
took care of him until her death, which
happened “when he was a little turned thirteen,
he had heard, but could not remember the
year.” After that he was “a helper and a
jobber in different stables,” and “anybody’s
boy,” for a few years, until he got a footman’s,
or rather footboy’s place, which he kept above
a year. After that he was in service, in and out
of different situations, until the time he specified,
when he had been out of place for nearly
five weeks, and was starving. His master had
got in difficulties, and had gone abroad; so he
was left without a character. “Well, sir,” he
continued, “the man as I wanted to steal the
sprats from, says to me, says he, ‘Poor fellow;
I know what a hempty belly is myself&mdash;come
and have a pint.’ And over that there pint, he
told me, if I could rise 10<i>s.</i> there might be a
chance for me in the streets, and he’d show me
how to do. He died not very long after that,
poor man. Well, after a little bit, I managed
to borrow 10<i>s.</i> of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (I thought of him
all of a sudden). He was butler in a family
that I had lived in, and had a charitable character,
though he was reckoned very proud.
But I plucked up a spirit, and told him how
I was off, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll try you,’
and he lent me 10<i>s.</i>, which I paid him back,
little by little, in six or eight weeks; and
so I started in the costermonger line, with the
advice of my friend, and I’ve made from 5<i>s.</i> to
10<i>s.</i>, sometimes more, a week, at it ever since.
The police don’t trouble me much. They is civil
to me in ’portion (proportion) as I am civil to
them. I never mixed with the costers but when
I’ve met them at market. I stay at a lodging-house,
but it’s very decent and clean, and I have
a bed to myself, at 1<i>s.</i> a week, for I’m a regular
man. I’m on sprats now, you see, sir, and you’d
wonder, sometimes, to see how keen people looks
to them when they’re new. They’re a blessing
to the poor, in ’portion (proportion) of course.
Not twenty minutes before you spoke to me,
there was two poor women came up&mdash;they was
sickly-looking, but I don’t know what they was&mdash;perhaps
shirt-makers&mdash;and they says to me,
says they, ‘Show us what a penny plateful is.’
‘Sart’nly, ladies,’ says I. Then they whispered
together, and at last one says, says she, ‘We’ll
have two platefuls.’ I told you they was a
blessing to the poor, sir&mdash;’specially to such as
them, as lives all the year round on bread and
tea. But it’s not only the poor as buys; others
in ’portion (proportion). When they’re new
they’re a treat to everybody. I’ve sold them
to poor working-men, who’ve said, ‘I’ll take
a treat home to the old ’oman and the kids;
they dotes on sprats.’ Gentlemen’s servants
is very fond of them, and mechanics comes
down&mdash;such as shoemakers in their leather
aprons, and sings out, ‘Here, old sprats, give
us two penn’orth.’ They’re <i>such</i> a relish. I sell
more to men than to women, perhaps, but
there’s little difference. They’re best stewed,
sir, I think&mdash;if you’re fond of sprats&mdash;with
vinegar and a pick of allspice; that’s my opinion,
and, only yesterday, an old cook said I
was right. I makes 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day,
and sometimes rather more, on my sprats, and
sticks to them as much as I can. I sell about
my ‘toss’ a day, seldom less. Of course I can
make as many penn’orths of it as I please,
but there’s no custom without one gives middling
penn’orths. If a toss costs me 3<i>s.</i>, I
may make sixty penn’orths of it sometimes&mdash;sometimes
seventy or more&mdash;and sometimes
less than sixty. There’s many turns over as
much as me and more than that. I’m thinking
that I’ll work the country with a lot;
they’ll keep to a second day, when they’re
fresh to start, ’specially if its frosty weather,
too, and then they’re better than ever&mdash;yes,
and a greater treat&mdash;scalding hot from the fire,
they’re the cheapest and best of all suppers in
the winter time. I hardly know which way I’ll
go. If I can get anythink to do among horses
in the country, I’ll never come back. I’ve no
tie to London.”</p>

<p>To show how small a sum of money will enable
the struggling striving poor to obtain a living,
I may here mention that, in the course of my
inquiries among the mudlarks, I casually gave
a poor shoeless urchin, who was spoken of by
one of the City Missionaries as being a well-disposed
youth, 1<i>s.</i> out of the funds that had
been entrusted to me to dispense. Trifling as
the amount appears, it was the means of
keeping his mother, sister, and himself through
the winter. It was invested in sprats, and
turned over and over again.</p>

<p>I am informed, by the best authorities, that
near upon 1000 “tosses” of sprats are sold
daily in London streets, while the season lasts.
These, sold retail in pennyworths, at very
nearly 5<i>s.</i> the toss, give about 150<i>l.</i> a day, or
say 1,000<i>l.</i> a week spent on sprats by the poorer
classes of the metropolis; so that, calculating
the sprat season to last ten weeks, about 10,000<i>l.</i>
would be taken by the costermongers during
that time from the sale of this fish alone.</p>

<p>Another return, furnished me by an eminent
salesman at Billingsgate, estimates the gross
quantity of sprats sold by the London costers
in the course of the season at three millions of
pounds weight, and this disposed of at the rate
of 1<i>d.</i> per pound, gives upwards of 12,000<i>l.</i> for
the sum of money spent upon this one kind
of fish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of Shell-Fish Sellers in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>I had the following account from an experienced
man. He lived with his mother, his
wife, and four children, in one of the streets
near Gray’s-inn-lane. The street was inhabited
altogether by people of his class, the
women looking sharply out when a stranger
visited the place. On my first visit to this
man’s room, his wife, who is near her confinement,
was at dinner with her children. The
time was &frac14; to 12. The meal was tea, and
bread with butter very thinly spread over it.
On the wife’s bread was a small piece of
pickled pork, covering about one-eighth of the
slice of a quartern loaf cut through. In one
corner of the room, which is on the ground-floor,
was a scantily-covered bed. A few
dingy-looking rags were hanging up to dry in
the middle of the room, which was littered with
baskets and boxes, mixed up with old furniture,
so that it was a difficulty to stir. The room
(although the paper, covering the broken panes
in the window, was torn and full of holes) was
most oppressively close and hot, and there
was a fetid smell, difficult to sustain, though
it was less noticeable on a subsequent call.
I have often had occasion to remark that the
poor, especially those who are much subjected
to cold in the open air, will sacrifice much
for heat. The adjoining room, which had no
door, seemed littered like the one where the
family were. The walls of the room I was in
were discoloured and weather-stained. The only
attempt at ornament was over the mantel-shelf,
the wall here being papered with red and
other gay-coloured papers, that once had been
upholsterer’s patterns.</p>

<p>On my second visit, the husband was at
dinner with the family, on good boiled beef and
potatoes. He was a small-featured man, with a
head of very curly and long black hair, and
both in mien, manners, and dress, resembled
the mechanic far more than the costermonger.
He <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been twenty years and more, perhaps
twenty-four, selling shell-fish in the streets.
I was a boot-closer when I was young, and
have made my 20<i>s.</i> and 30<i>s.</i>, and sometimes 40<i>s.</i>,
and then sometimes not 10<i>s.</i> a week; but I had
an attack of rheumatic-fever, and lost the use of
my hands for my trade. The streets hadn’t
any great name, as far as I knew, then, but as
I couldn’t work, it was just a choice between
street-selling and starving, so I didn’t prefer the
last. It was reckoned degrading to go into the
streets&mdash;but I couldn’t help that. I was astonished
at my success when I first began, and
got into the business&mdash;that is into the understanding
of it&mdash;after a week, or two, or three.
Why, I made 3<i>l.</i> the first week I knew my
trade, properly; yes, I cleared 3<i>l.</i>! I made,
not long after, 5<i>l.</i> a week&mdash;but not often. I was
giddy and extravagant. Indeed, I was a fool,
and spent my money like a fool. I could have
brought up a family then like a gentleman&mdash;I
send them to school as it is&mdash;but I hadn’t a
wife and family then, or it might have been
better; it’s a great check on a man, is a family.
I began with shell-fish, and sell it still; very
seldom anything else. There’s more demand
for shells, no doubt, because its far cheaper,
but then there’s so many more sellers. I don’t
know why exactly. I suppose it’s because poor
people go into the streets when they can’t live
other ways, and some do it because they think
it’s an idle life; but it ain’t. Where I took 35<i>s.</i>
in a day at my stall&mdash;and well on to half of it
profit&mdash;I now take 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i>, or perhaps 7<i>s.</i>, in
the day and less profit on that less money.
I don’t clear 3<i>s.</i> a day now, take the year
through. I don’t keep accounts, but I’m
certain enough that I average about 15<i>s.</i> a
week the year through, and my wife has to help
me to make that. She’ll mind the stall, while I
take a round sometimes. I sell all kinds of
shell-fish, but my great dependence is on
winkles. I don’t do much in lobsters. Very
few speculate in them. The price varies
very greatly. What’s 10<i>s.</i> a score one day
may be 25<i>s.</i> the next. I sometimes get a score
for 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i>, but it’s a poor trade, for 6<i>d.</i> is the
top of the tree, with me, for a price to a seller.
I never get more. I sell them to mechanics
and tradesmen. I do more in pound crabs.
There’s a great call for haporths and pennorths
of lobster or crab, by children; that’s their
claws. I bile them all myself, and buy them
alive. I can bile twenty in half an hour, and
do it over a grate in a back-yard. Lobsters
don’t fight or struggle much in the hot
water, if they’re properly packed. It’s very
few that knows how to bile a lobster as he
should be biled. I wish I knew any way of
killing lobsters before biling them. I can’t
kill them without smashing them to bits, and
that won’t do at all. I kill my crabs before I
bile them. I stick them in the throat with a
knife and they’re dead in an instant. Some
sticks them with a skewer, but they kick a good
while with the skewer in them. It’s a shame
to torture anything when it can be helped. If
I didn’t kill the crabs they’d shed every leg
in the hot water; they’d come out as bare of
claws as this plate. I’ve known it oft enough,
as it is; though I kill them uncommon quick, a
crab will be quicker and shed every leg&mdash;throw
them off in the moment I kill them, but that
doesn’t happen once in fifty times. Oysters
are capital this season, I mean as to quality,
but they’re not a good sale. I made 3<i>l.</i> a
week in oysters, not reckoning anything else,
eighteen or twenty years back. It was easy to
make money then; like putting down one
sovereign and taking two up. I sold oysters
then oft enough at 1<i>d.</i> a piece. Now I sell
far finer at three a penny and five for 2<i>d.</i> People
can’t spend money in shell-fish when they
haven’t got any. They say that fortune knocks
once at every man’s door. I wish I’d opened
my door when he knocked at it.”</p>

<p>This man’s wife told me afterwards, that last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
winter, after an attack of rheumatism, all their
stock-money was exhausted, and her husband
sat day by day at home almost out of his mind;
for nothing could tempt him to apply to the
parish, and “he would never have mentioned
his sufferings to me,” she said; “he had too
much pride.” The loan of a few shillings from
a poor costermonger enabled the man to go to
market again, or he and his family would now
have been in the Union.</p>

<p>As to the quantity of shell-fish sold in the
streets of London, the returns before-cited give
the following results:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of Shrimp Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Shrimp selling, as I have stated, is one of the
trades to which the street-dealer often confines
himself throughout the year. The sale is
about equally divided between the two sexes,
but the men do the most business, walking
some of them fifteen to twenty miles a day
in a “round” of “ten miles there and ten
back.”</p>

<p>The shrimps vended in the streets are the
Yarmouth prawn shrimps, sold at Billingsgate
at from 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> a gallon, while the best
shrimps (chiefly from Lee, in Essex,) vary in
price from 10<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a gallon; 2<i>s.</i> being
a common price. The shrimps are usually
mixed by the street-dealers, and they are cried,
from stalls or on rounds, “a penny half-pint, fine
fresh s’rimps.” (I heard them called nothing but
“s’rimps” by the street-dealers.) The half-pint,
however, is in reality but half that quantity.
“It’s the same measure as it was thirty years
back,” I was told, in a tone as if its antiquity
removed all imputation of unfair dealing.
Some young men “do well on s’rimps,”
sometimes taking 5<i>s.</i> in an hour on a Saturday
evening, “when people get their money, and
wants a relish.” The females in the shrimp
line are the wives, widows, or daughters of
costermongers. They are computed to average
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day profit in fine, and from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>
in bad weather; and, in snowy, or very severe
weather, sometimes nothing at all.</p>

<p>One shrimp-seller, a middle-aged woman,
wrapped up in a hybrid sort of cloak, that
was half a man’s and half a woman’s garment,
gave me the following account. There
was little vulgarity in either her language or
manner.</p>

<p>“I was in the s’rimp trade since I was a girl.
I don’t know how long. I don’t know how old
I am. I never knew; but I’ve two children,
one’s six and t’other’s near eight, both girls;
I’ve kept count of that as well as I can. My
husband sells fish in the street; so did father,
but he’s dead. We buried him without the help
of the parish, as many gets&mdash;that’s something
to say. I’ve known the trade every way. It
never was any good in public-houses. They
want such great ha’p’orths there. They’ll put
up with what isn’t very fresh, to be sure, sometimes;
and good enough for them too, I say,
as spoils their taste with drink.” [This was
said very bitterly.] “If it wasn’t for my husband’s
drinking for a day together now and then
we’d do better. He’s neither to have nor to hold
when he’s the worse for liquor; and it’s the
worse with him, for he’s a quiet man when he’s
his own man. Perhaps I make 9<i>d.</i> a day, perhaps
1<i>s.</i> or more. Sometimes my husband takes
my stand, and I go a round. Sometimes, if he
gets through his fish, he goes my round. I give
good measure, and my pint’s the regular s’rimp
pint.” [It was the <i>half</i>-pint I have described.]
“The trade’s not so good as it was. People hasn’t
the money, they tells me so. It’s bread before
s’rimps, says they. I’ve heard them say it very
cross, if I’ve wanted hard to sell. Some days
I can sell nothing. My children stays with my
sister, when me and my old man’s out. They
don’t go to school, but Jane (the sister) learns
them to sew. She makes drawers for the slopsellers,
but has very little work, and gets very
little for the little she does; she would learn
them to read if she knew how. She’s married
to a pavior, that’s away all day. It’s a hard life
mine, sir. The winter’s a coming, and I’m now
sometimes ’numbed with sitting at my stall in
the cold. My feet feels like lumps of ice in
the winter; and they’re beginning now, as if
they weren’t my own. Standing’s far harder
work than going a round. I sell the best s’rimps.
My customers is judges. If I’ve any s’rimps
over on a night, as I often have one or two
nights a week, I sells them for half-price to
an Irishwoman, and she takes them to the
beer-shops, and the coffee-shops. She washes
them to look fresh. I don’t mind telling that,
because people should buy of regular people.
It’s very few people know how to pick a s’rimp
properly. You should take it by the head and
the tail and jam them up, and then the shell
separates, and the s’rimp comes out beautifully.
That’s the proper way.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the sale on the rounds may be the
same as that at the stalls, or 10 or 20 per cent.
more or less, according to the weather, as shrimps
can be sold by the itinerant dealers better than
by the stall-keepers in wet weather, when people
prefer buying at their doors. But in hot
weather the stall trade is the best, “for people
often fancy that the s’rimps is sent out to sell
’cause they’ll not keep no longer. It’s only
among customers as knows you, you can do
any good on a round then.”</p>

<p>The costermongers sell annually, it appears,
about 770,000 pints of shrimps. At
2<i>d.</i> a pint (a very low calculation) the street
sale of shrimps amount to upwards of 6,400<i>l.</i>
yearly.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of Oyster Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The trade in oysters is unquestionably one of
the oldest with which the London&mdash;or rather
the English&mdash;markets are connected; for oysters
from Britain were a luxury in ancient Rome.</p>

<p>Oysters are now sold out of the smacks at
Billingsgate, and a few at Hungerford. The
more expensive kind such as the real Milton,
are never bought by the costermongers, but they
buy oysters of a “good middling quality.” At
the commencement of the season these oysters
are 14<i>s.</i> a “bushel,” but the measure contains
from a bushel and a half to two bushels, as it is
more or less heaped up. The general price,
however, is 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, but they <i>have</i> been 16<i>s.</i>
and 18<i>s.</i> The “big trade” was unknown until
1848, when the very large shelly oysters, the fish
inside being very small, were introduced from
the Sussex coast. They were sold in Thames-street
and by the Borough-market. Their sale
was at first enormous. The costermongers distinguished
them by the name of “scuttle-mouths.”
One coster informant told me that on the Saturdays
he not unfrequently, with the help of a boy
and a girl, cleared 10<i>s.</i> by selling these oysters
in the streets, disposing of four bags. He thus
sold, reckoning twenty-one dozen to the bag,
2,016 oysters; and as the price was two for a
penny, he took just 4<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> by the sale of oysters
in the streets in one night. With the scuttle-mouths
the costermonger takes no trouble: he
throws them into a yard, and dashes a few pails
of water over them, and then places them on his
barrow, or conveys them to his stall. Some of
the better class of costermongers, however, lay
down their oysters carefully, giving them oatmeal
“to fatten on.”</p>

<p>In April last, some of the street-sellers of this
article established, for the first time, “oyster-rounds.”
These were carried on by costermongers
whose business was over at twelve in
the day, or a little later; they bought a bushel
of scuttle-mouths (never the others), and, in
the afternoon, went a round with them to poor
neighbourhoods, until about six, when they
took a stand in some frequented street. Going
these oyster-rounds is hard work, I am told,
and a boy is generally taken to assist. Monday
afternoon is the best time for this trade, when
10<i>s.</i> is sometimes taken, and 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> profit
made. On other evenings only from 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>
is taken&mdash;very rarely the larger sum&mdash;as the
later the day in the week the smaller is the
receipt, owing to the wages of the working
classes getting gradually exhausted.</p>

<p>The women who sell oysters in the street, and
whose dealings are limited, buy either of the
costermongers or at the coal-sheds. But nearly
all the men buy at Billingsgate, where as small
a quantity as a peck can be had.</p>

<p>An old woman, who had “seen better days,”
but had been reduced to keep an oyster-stall,
gave me the following account of her customers.
She showed much shrewdness in her conversation,
but having known better days, she declined
to enter upon any conversation concerning her
former <span class="lock">life:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“As to my customers, sir,” she said, “why,
indeed, they’re all sorts. It’s not a very few
times that gentlemen (I call them so because
they’re mostly so civil) will stop&mdash;just as it’s
getting darkish, perhaps,&mdash;and look about them,
and then come to me and say very quick:
‘Two penn’orth for a whet.’ Ah! some of ’em
will look, may be, like poor parsons down upon
their luck, and swallow their oysters as if they
was taking poison in a hurry. They’ll not touch
the bread or butter once in twenty times, but
they’ll be free with the pepper and vinegar, or,
mayhap, they’ll say quick and short, ‘A crust
off that.’ I many a time think <i>that</i> two penn’orth
is a poor gentleman’s dinner. It’s the
same often&mdash;but only half as often, or not half&mdash;with
a poor lady, with a veil that once was
black, over a bonnet to match, and shivering
through her shawl. She’ll have the same. About
two penn’orth is the mark still; it’s mostly two
penn’orth. My son says, it’s because that’s the
price of a glass of gin, and some persons buy
oysters instead&mdash;but that’s only his joke, sir.
It’s not the vulgar poor that’s our chief customers.
There’s many of them won’t touch
oysters, and I’ve heard some of them say: ‘The
sight on ’em makes me sick; it’s like eating
snails.’ The poor girls that walk the streets
often buy; some are brazen and vulgar, and
often the finest dressed are the vulgarest; at
least, I think so; and of those that come to
oyster stalls, I’m sure it’s the case. Some are
shy to such as me, who may, perhaps, call their
own mothers to their minds, though it aint
many of them that is so. One of them always
says that she must keep at least a penny for gin
after her oysters. One young woman ran away
from my stall once after swallowing one oyster
out of six that she’d paid for. I don’t know
why. Ah! there’s many things a person like
me sees that one may say, ‘I don’t know why’
to; that there is. My heartiest customers, that
I serve with the most pleasure, are working
people, on a Saturday night. One couple&mdash;I
think the wife always goes to meet her husband
on a Saturday night&mdash;has two, or three, or four
penn’orth, as happens, and it’s pleasant to
hear them say, ‘Won’t you have another,
John?’ or, ‘Do have one or two more, Mary
Anne.’ I’ve served them that way two or three
years. They’ve no children, I’m pretty sure,
for if I say, ‘Take a few home to the little
ones,’ the wife tosses her head, and says, half
vexed and half laughing, ‘<i>Such</i> nonsense.’ I
send out a good many oysters, opened, for
people’s suppers, and sometimes for supper
parties&mdash;at least, I suppose so, for there’s five
or six dozen often ordered. The maid-servants
come for them then, and I give them two or three
for themselves, and say, jokingly-like, ‘It’s no
use offering you any, perhaps, because you’ll have
plenty that’s left.’ They’ve mostly one answer:
‘Don’t we wish we may get ’em?’ The <i>very</i>
poor never buy of me, as I told you. A penny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
buys a loaf, you see, or a ha’porth of bread and
a ha’porth of cheese, or a half-pint of beer, with
a farthing out. My customers are mostly working
people and tradespeople. Ah! sir, I wish
the parson of the parish, or any parson, sat with
me a fortnight; he’d see what life is then.
‘It’s different,’ a learned man used to say to
me&mdash;that’s long ago&mdash;‘from what’s noticed from
the pew or the pulpit.’ I’ve missed the gentleman
as used to say that, now many years&mdash;I
don’t know how many. I never knew his name.
He was drunk now and then, and used to tell
me he was an author. I felt for him. A dozen
oysters wasn’t much for him. We see a deal of
the world, sir&mdash;yes, a deal. Some, mostly working
people, take quantities of pepper with their
oysters in cold weather, and say it’s to warm
them, and no doubt it does; but frosty weather
is very bad oyster weather. The oysters gape and
die, and then they are not so much as manure.
They are very fine this year. I clear 1<i>s.</i> a day,
I think, during the season&mdash;at least 1<i>s.</i>, taking
the fine with the wet days, and the week days
with the Sundays, though I’m not out then;
but, you see, I’m known about here.”</p>

<p>The number of oysters sold by the costermongers
amounts to 124,000,000 a year. These,
at four a penny, would realise the large sum of
129,650<i>l.</i> We may therefore safely assume that
125,000<i>l.</i> is spent yearly in oysters in the streets
of London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Periwinkle Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>There are some street people who, nearly all
the year through, sell nothing but periwinkles,
and go regular rounds, where they are well
known. The “wink” men, as these periwinkle
sellers are called, generally live in the lowest
parts, and many in lodging-houses. They are
forced to live in low localities, they say, because
of the smell of the fish, which is objected to.
The city district is ordinarily the best for winkle-sellers,
for there are not so many cheap shops
there as in other parts. The summer is the best
season, and the sellers then make, upon the
average, 12<i>s.</i> a week clear profit; in the winter,
they get upon the average, 5<i>s.</i> a week clear, by
selling mussels and whelks&mdash;for, as winkles last
only from March till October, they are then
obliged to do what they can in the whelk and
mussel way. “I buy my winks,” said one, “at
Billingsgate, at 3<i>s.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> the wash. A wash
is about a bushel. There’s some at 2<i>s.</i>, and
some sometimes as low as 1<i>s.</i> the wash, but they
wouldn’t do for me, as I serve very respectable
people. If we choose we can boil our winkles
at Billingsgate by paying 4<i>d.</i> a week for boiling,
and &frac12;<i>d.</i> for salt, to salt them after they are boiled.
Tradesmen’s families buy them for a relish to
their tea. It’s reckoned a nice present from a
young man to his sweetheart, is winks. Servant
girls are pretty good customers, and want them
cheaper when they say it’s for themselves; but
I have only one price.”</p>

<p>One man told me he could make as much as
12<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>

<p>He made no speeches, but sung&mdash;“Winketty-winketty-wink-wink-wink&mdash;wink-wink&mdash;wicketty-wicketty-wink&mdash;fine
fresh winketty-winks
wink wink.” He was often so sore in the stomach
and hoarse with hallooing that he could hardly
speak. He had no child, only himself and
wife to keep out of his earnings. His room
was 2<i>s.</i> a week rent. He managed to get a bit
of meat every day, he said, “somehow or
’nother.”</p>

<p>Another, more communicative and far more
intelligent man, said to me concerning the
character of his customers: “They’re people
I think that like to daddle” (dawdle, I presume)
“over their teas or such like; or when a young
woman’s young man takes tea with her mother
and her, then they’ve winks; and then there’s
joking, and helping to pick winks, between
Thomas and Betsy, while the mother’s busy
with her tea, or is wiping her specs, ’cause she
<i>can’t</i> see. Why, sir, I’ve known it! I was
a Thomas that way myself when I was a
tradesman. I was a patten-maker once, but
pattens is no go now, and hasn’t been for fifteen
year or more. Old people, I think, that lives
by themselves, and has perhaps an annuity or
the like of that, and nothing to do pertickler,
loves winks, for they likes a pleasant way of
making time long over a meal. They’re the
people as reads a newspaper, when it’s a week
old, all through. The other buyers, I think, are
tradespeople or working-people what wants a
relish. But winks is a bad trade now, and so
is many that depends on relishes.”</p>

<p>One man who “works” the New Cut, has
the “best wink business of all.” He sells
only a little dry fish with his winks, never wet
fish, and has “got his name up,” for the
superiority of that shell-fish&mdash;a superiority
which he is careful to ensure. He pays 8<i>s.</i>
a week for a stand by a grocer’s window. On
an ordinary afternoon he sells from 7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>
worth of periwinkles. On a Monday afternoon
he often takes 20<i>s.</i>; and on the Sunday
afternoon 3<i>l.</i> and 4<i>l.</i> He has two coster lads
to help him, and sometimes on a Sunday from
twenty to thirty customers about him. He
wraps each parcel sold in a neat brown paper
bag, which, I am assured, is of itself, an inducement
to buy of him. The “unfortunate”
women who live in the streets contiguous to the
Waterloo, Blackfriars, and Borough-roads, are
among his best customers, on Sundays especially.
He is rather a public character, getting
up dances and the like. “<i>He</i> aint bothered&mdash;not
he&mdash;with ha’p’orths or penn’orths of a Sunday,”
said a person who had assisted him. “It’s
the top of the tree with his customers; 3<i>d.</i> or
6<i>d.</i> at a go.” The receipts are one-half profit.
I heard from several that he was “the best man
for winks a-going.”</p>

<p>The quantity of periwinkles disposed of by the
London street-sellers is 3,600,000 pints, which,
at 1<i>d.</i> per pint, gives the large sum of 15,000<i>l.</i>
expended annually in this street luxury. It
should be remembered, that a very large con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>sumption
of periwinkles takes place in public-houses
and suburban tea-gardens.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Dry” Fish Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The dealing in “dry” or salt fish is never
carried on as a totally distinct trade in the streets,
but some make it a principal part of their business;
and many wet fish-dealers whose “wet
fish” is disposed of by noon, sell dry fish in the
afternoon. The dry fish, proper, consists of dried
mackerel, salt cod&mdash;dried or barrelled&mdash;smoked
or dried haddocks (often called “finnie haddies”),
dried or pickled salmon (but salmon is only salted
or pickled for the streets when it can be sold
cheap), and salt herrings.</p>

<p>A keen-looking, tidily-dressed man, who was
at one time a dry fish-seller principally, gave
me the following account. For the last two
months he has confined himself to another
branch of the business, and seemed to feel a
sort of pleasure in telling of the “dodges” he
once resorted to:</p>

<p>“There’s Scotch haddies that never knew anything
about Scotland,” he said, “for I’ve made
lots of them myself by Tower-street, just a
jump or two from the Lambeth station-house.
I used to make them on Sundays. I was a wet
fish-seller then, and when I couldn’t get through
my haddocks or my whitings of a Saturday night,
I wasn’t a-going to give them away to folks
that wouldn’t take the trouble to lift me out of
a gutter if I fell there, so I presarved them.
I’ve made haddies of whitings, and good ones
too, and Joe made them of codlings besides.
I had a bit of a back-yard to two rooms, one
over the other, that I had then, and on a
Sunday I set some wet wood a fire, and put it
under a great tub. My children used to gut
and wash the fish, and I hung them on hooks
all round the sides of the tub, and made a
bit of a chimney in a corner of the top of the
tub, and that way I gave them a jolly good
smoking. My wife had a dry fish-stall and
sold them, and used to sing out ‘Real Scotch
haddies,’ and tell people how they was from
Aberdeen; I’ve often been fit to laugh, she
did it so clever. I had a way of giving them a
yellow colour like the real Scotch, but that’s a
secret. After they was well smoked they was
hung up to dry all round the rooms we lived in,
and we often had stunning fires that answered
as well to boil crabs and lobsters when they was
cheap enough for the streets. I’ve boiled a
mate’s crabs and lobsters for 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>; it was two
boilings and more, and 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> was reckoned the
price of half a quarter of a hundred of coals and
the use of the pan. There’s more ways than
one of making 6<i>d.</i>, if a man has eyes in his
head and keeps them open. Haddocks that
wouldn’t fetch 1<i>d.</i> a piece, nor any money at all
of a Saturday night, I’ve sold&mdash;at least she has”
(indicating his wife by a motion of his thumb)&mdash;“at
2<i>d.</i>, and 3<i>d.</i>, and 4<i>d.</i> I’ve bought fish of
costers that was over on a Saturday night, to
make Scotch haddies of them. I’ve tried
experience” (experiments) “too. Ivy, burnt
under them, gave them, I thought, a nice
sort of flavour, rather peppery, for I used
always to taste them; but I hate living
on fish. Ivy with brown berries on it, as
it has about this time o’ year, I liked best.
Holly wasn’t no good. A black-currant bush
was, but it’s too dear; and indeed it couldn’t
be had. I mostly spread wetted fire-wood, as
green as could be got, or damp sticks of any
kind, over shavings, and kept feeding the fire.
Sometimes I burnt sawdust. Somehow, the
dry fish trade fell off. People does get so prying
and so knowing, there’s no doing nothing
now for no time, so I dropped the dry fish trade.
There’s few up to smoking them proper; they
smoke ’em black, as if they was hung up in a
chimbley.”</p>

<p>Another costermonger gave me the following
account:</p>

<p>“I’ve salted herrings, but the commonest way
of salting is by the Jews about Whitechapel.
They make real Yarmouth bloaters and all sorts
of fish. When I salted herrings, I bought them
out of the boats at Billingsgate by the hundred,
which is 120 fish. We give them a bit of a clean&mdash;hardly
anything&mdash;then chuck them into a tub
of salt, and keep scattering salt over them, and
let them lie a few minutes, or sometimes half an
hour, and then hang them up to dry. They
eat well enough, if they’re eaten in time, for
they won’t keep. I’ve known three day’s old
herrings salted, just because there was no sale
for them. One Jew sends out six boys crying
‘real Yarmouth bloaters.’ People buy them
in preference, they look so nice and clean
and fresh-coloured. It’s quite a new trade
among the Jews. They didn’t do much that
way until two years back. I sometimes wish
I was a Jew, because they help one another,
and start one another with money, and so they
thrive where Christians are ruined. I smoked
mackerel, too, by thousands; that’s a new trade,
and is done the same way as haddocks. Mackerel
that won’t bring 1<i>d.</i> a piece fresh, bring 2<i>d.</i>
smoked; they are very nice indeed. I make
about 10<i>s.</i> or 11<i>s.</i> a week by dry fish in the
winter months, and about as much by wet,&mdash;but
I have a tidy connection. Perhaps I make
17<i>s.</i> or 18<i>s.</i> a week all the year round.”</p>

<p>The aggregate quantity of dry fish sold by
the London costermongers throughout the year
is as follows&mdash;the results being deduced from
the table before given:</p>

<p>Adding together the above totals, we have
the following result as to the gross money
value of the fish purchased yearly in the London
streets:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>£</th></tr>
<tr><td>Wet fish</td><td class="right">1,177,200</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Hence we find that there is nearly a million
and a half of money annually spent by the
poorer classes of the metropolis in fish; a sum
so prodigious as almost to discredit every statement
of want, even if the amount said to be so
expended be believed. The returns from which
the above account is made out have been obtained,
however, from such unquestionable sources&mdash;not
from one salesman alone, but checked and
corrected by many gentlemen who can have no
conceivable motive for exaggeration either one
way or the other&mdash;that, sceptical as our utter
ignorance of the subject must necessarily make
us, still if we will but examine for ourselves, we
shall find there is no gainsaying the facts.</p>

<p>Moreover as to the enormity of the amount
dispelling all ideas of privation among the industrious
portion of the community, we shall
also find on examination that assuming the
working-men of the metropolis to be 500,000 in
number (the Occupation Abstract of 1841, gives
773,560 individuals following <i>some</i> employment
in London, but these include merchants, employers,
shopkeepers, Government-officers and
others), and that they, with their wives and children,
make up one million individuals, it follows
that the sum per head, expended in fish by the
poorer classes every week, is a fraction more than
6&frac34;<i>d.</i>, or, in other words not quite one penny a
day.</p>

<p>If the diet of a people be a criterion, as has
been asserted, of their character, it may be feared
that the present extensive fish-diet of the working-people
of London, is as indicative of degeneracy
of character, as Cobbett insisted must
result from the consumption of tea, and “the
cursed root,” the potato. “The flesh of fish,”
says Pereira on Diet, “is less satisfying than the
flesh of either quadrupeds or birds. As it contains
a larger proportion of water (about 80 per
cent.), it is obviously less nourishing.” Haller
tells us he found himself weakened by a fish-diet;
and he states that Roman Catholics are
generally debilitated during Lent. Pechlin also
affirms that a mechanic, nourished merely by
fish, has less muscular power than one who lives
on the flesh of warm-blooded animals. Jockeys,
who <i>waste themselves</i> in order to reduce their
weight, live principally on fish.</p>

<p>The classes of fish above given, are, when
considered in a “dietetical point of view,” of
two distinct kinds; viz., those which form the
staple commodity of the dinners and suppers of
the poor, and those which are mere relishes or
stimuli to failing, rather than stays to, eager
appetites. Under the former head, I include
red-herrings, bloaters, and smoked haddocks;
such things are not merely provocatives to eat,
among the poor, as they are at the breakfast-table
of many an over-fed or intemperate man.
With the less affluent these salted fish are not a
“relish,” but a meal.</p>

<p>The shell-fish, however, can only be considered
as luxuries. The 150,000<i>l.</i> thus annually
expended in the streets, represents the sum
laid out in mere relishes or stimuli to sluggish
appetites. A very large proportion of this amount,
I am inclined to believe, is spent by persons
whose stomachs have been disordered by drink.
A considerable part of the trade in the minor
articles, as winks, shrimps, &amp;c., is carried on in
public-houses, while a favourite pitch for an
oyster-stall is outside a tavern-door. If, then,
so large an amount is laid out in an endeavour
to restore the appetite after drinking, how much
money must be squandered in destroying it by
the same means?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.</h2>



<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Kinds and Quantity of Fruit
and Vegetables sold in the Streets.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There are two kinds of fruit sold in the streets&mdash;“green
fruit” and “dry fruit.”</p>

<p>In commerce, all fruit which is edible as it is
taken from the tree or the ground, is known
as “green.” A subdivision of this green fruit
is into “fresh” or “tender” fruit, which includes
currants, gooseberries, strawberries, and,
indeed, all fruits that demand immediate consumption,
in contradistinction to such productions
as nuts which may be kept without injury
for a season. All fruit which is “cured” is
known as “dry” fruit. In summer the costers
vend “green fruit,” and in the winter months, or
in the early spring, when the dearness or insufficiency
of the supply of green fruit renders it
unsuited for their traffic, they resort, but not
extensively, to “dry fruit.” It is principally,
however, when an abundant season, or the impossibility
of keeping the dry fruit much longer,
has tended to reduce the price of it, that the
costlier articles are to be found on the costermonger’s
barrow.</p>

<p>Fruit is, for the most part, displayed on barrows,
by the street-dealers in it. Some who
supply the better sort of houses&mdash;more especially
those in the suburbs&mdash;carry such things
as apples and plums, in clean round wicker-baskets,
holding pecks or half-pecks.</p>

<p>The commoner “green” fruits of home produce
are bought by the costermonger in the markets.
The foreign green fruit, as pine-apples,
melons, grapes, chestnuts, coker-nuts, Brazil-nuts,
hazel-nuts, and oranges, are purchased by
them at the public sales of the brokers, and of
the Jews in Duke’s-place. The more intelligent
and thrifty of the costers buy at the public sales
on the principle of association, as I have elsewhere
described. Some costermongers expend as much
as 20<i>l.</i> at a time in such green fruit, or dry fruit,
as is not immediately perishable, at a public sale,
or at a fruit-warehouse, and supply the other
costers.</p>

<p>The regular costermongers seldom deal in
oranges and chestnuts. If they sell walnuts, they
reserve these, they say, for their Sunday afternoon’s
pastime. The people who carry oranges,
chestnuts, or walnuts, or Spanish nuts about the
town, are not considered as costermongers, but
are generally, though not always, classed, by
the regular men, with the watercress-women,
the sprat-women, the winkle-dealers, and such
others, whom they consider beneath them. The
orange season is called by the costermonger the
“Irishman’s harvest.” Indeed, the street trade
in oranges and nuts is almost entirely in the
hands of the Irish and their children; and of
the children of costermongers. The costers
themselves would rather starve&mdash;and do starve
now and then&mdash;than condescend to it. The
trade in coker-nuts is carried on greatly by
the Jews on Sundays, and by young men
and boys who are not on other days employed
as street-sellers.</p>

<p>The usual kinds of fruit the regular costers
deal in are strawberries, raspberries (plain and
stalked), cherries, apricots, plums, green-gages,
currants, apples, pears, damsons, green and ripe
gooseberries, and pine-apples. They also deal
in vegetables, such as turnips, greens, brocoli,
carrots, onions, celery, rhubarb, new potatoes,
peas, beans (French and scarlet, broad and Windsor),
asparagus, vegetable marrow, seakale, spinach,
lettuces, small salads, radishes, etc. Their
fruit and vegetables they usually buy at Covent-garden,
Spitalfields, or the Borough markets.
Occasionally they buy some at Farringdon, but
this they reckon to be very little better than a
“haggler’s market,”&mdash;a “haggler” being, as I
before explained, the middle-man who attends
in the fruit and vegetable-markets, and buys of
the salesman to sell again to the retail dealer or
costermonger.</p>

<p>Concerning the quantity of fruit and vegetables
sold in the streets, by the London costermongers.
This, as I said, when treating
of the street-trade in fish, can only be
arrived at by ascertaining the entire quantity
sold wholesale at the London markets, and then
learning from the best authorities the proportion
retailed in the public thoroughfares. Fully
to elucidate this matter, both as to the extent of
the metropolitan supply of vegetables and fruit,
(“foreign” as well as “home-grown,” and
“green” as well as “dry”) and the relative
quantity of each, vended through the agency of
the costermongers, I caused inquiries to be
instituted at all the principal markets and
brokers (for not even the vaguest return on the
subject had, till then, been prepared), and
received from all the gentlemen connected
therewith, every assistance and information, as
I have here great pleasure in acknowledging.</p>

<p>To carry out my present inquiry, I need not
give returns of the articles <i>not</i> sold by the costermongers,
nor is it necessary for me to cite
any but those dealt in by them generally. Their
exceptional sales, such as of mushrooms, cucumbers,
&amp;c., are not included here.</p>

<p>The following Table shows the ordinary
annual supply of <i>home grown fruit</i> (nearly all
produced within a radius of twelve miles from
the Bank) to each of the London “green”
markets.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Fruit and Vegetable Season of
the Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>The strawberry season begins about June,
and continues till about the middle of July.
From the middle to the end of July the costers
“work” raspberries. During July cherries are
“in” as well as raspberries; but many costers
prefer working raspberries, because “they’re a
quicker sixpence.” After the cherries, they go
to work upon plums, which they have about the
end of August. Apples and pears come in after
the plums in the month of September, and the
apples last them all through the winter till the
month of May. The pears last only till Christmas.
Currants they work about the latter end
of July, or beginning of August.</p>

<p>Concerning the costermonger’s vegetable season,
it may be said that he “works” greens
during the winter months, up to about March;
from that time they are getting “leathery,” the
leaves become foxy, I was told, and they eat
tough when boiled. The costers generally do not
like dealing either in greens or turnips, “they
are such heavy luggage,” they say. They would
sooner “work” green peas and new potatoes.</p>

<p>The costermonger, however, does the best at
fruit; but this he cannot work&mdash;with the exception
of apples&mdash;for more than four months
in the year. They lose but little from the fruit
spoiling. “If it doesn’t fetch a good price, it
must fetch a bad one,” they say; but they are
never at a great loss by it. They find the “ladies”
their hardest or “scaliest” customers. Whatever
price they ask, they declare the “ladies” will
try to save the market or “gin” penny out of
it, so that they may have “a glass of something
short” before they go home.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Covent Garden Market.</span></h3>

<p>On a Saturday&mdash;the coster’s business day&mdash;it is
computed that as many as 2,000 donkey-barrows,
and upwards of 3,000 women with shallows and
head-baskets visit this market during the forenoon.
About six o’clock in the morning is the
best time for viewing the wonderful restlessness
of the place, for then not only is the “Garden”
itself all bustle and activity, but the buyers and
sellers stream to and from it in all directions,
filling every street in the vicinity. From Long
Acre to the Strand on the one side, and from
Bow-street to Bedford-street on the other, the
ground has been seized upon by the market-goers.
As you glance down any one of the neighbouring
streets, the long rows of carts and donkey-barrows
seem interminable in the distance.
They are of all kinds, from the greengrocer’s
taxed cart to the coster’s barrow&mdash;from the
showy excursion-van to the rude square donkey-cart
and bricklayer’s truck. In every street
they are ranged down the middle and by the
kerb-stones. Along each approach to the
market, too, nothing is to be seen, on all sides,
but vegetables; the pavement is covered with
heaps of them waiting to be carted; the flagstones
are stained green with the leaves trodden
under foot; sieves and sacks full of apples and
potatoes, and bundles of brocoli and rhubarb,
are left unwatched upon almost every door-step;
the steps of Covent Garden Theatre are
covered with fruit and vegetables; the road is
blocked up with mountains of cabbages and
turnips; and men and women push past with
their arms bowed out by the cauliflowers under
them, or the red tips of carrots pointing from
their crammed aprons, or else their faces are red
with the weight of the loaded head-basket.</p>

<p>The donkey-barrows, from their number and
singularity, force you to stop and notice them.
Every kind of ingenuity has been exercised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
construct harness for the costers’ steeds; where
a buckle is wanting, tape or string make the
fastening secure; traces are made of rope and
old chain, and an old sack or cotton handkerchief
is folded up as a saddle-pad. Some few
of the barrows make a magnificent exception,
and are gay with bright brass; while one of the
donkeys may be seen dressed in a suit of old
plated carriage-harness, decorated with coronets
in all directions. At some one of the coster conveyances
stands the proprietor, arranging his
goods, the dozing animal starting up from its
sleep each time a heavy basket is hoisted on the
tray. Others, with their green and white and red
load neatly arranged, are ready for starting, but
the coster is finishing his breakfast at the coffee-stall.
On one barrow there may occasionally be
seen a solitary sieve of apples, with the horse of
some neighbouring cart helping himself to the
pippins while the owner is away. The men that
take charge of the trucks, whilst the costers visit
the market, walk about, with their arms full of
whips and sticks. At one corner a donkey has
slipped down, and lies on the stones covered
with the cabbages and apples that have fallen
from the cart.</p>

<p>The market itself presents a beautiful scene.
In the clear morning air of an autumn day the
whole of the vast square is distinctly seen from
one end to the other. The sky is red and golden
with the newly-risen sun, and the rays falling
on the fresh and vivid colours of the fruit and
vegetables, brightens up the picture as with a
coat of varnish. There is no shouting, as at
other markets, but a low murmuring hum is
heard, like the sound of the sea at a distance,
and through each entrance to the market the
crowd sweeps by. Under the dark Piazza little
bright dots of gas-lights are seen burning in
the shops; and in the paved square the people
pass and cross each other in all directions, hampers
clash together, and excepting the carters
from the country, every one is on the move.
Sometimes a huge column of baskets is seen in
the air, and walks away in a marvellously steady
manner, or a monster railway van, laden with
sieves of fruit, and with the driver perched up
on his high seat, jolts heavily over the stones.
Cabbages are piled up into stacks as it were.
Carts are heaped high with turnips, and bunches
of carrots like huge red fingers, are seen in all
directions. Flower-girls, with large bundles of
violets under their arms, run past, leaving a
trail of perfume behind them. Wagons, with
their shafts sticking up in the air, are ranged
before the salesmen’s shops, the high green load
railed in with hurdles, and every here and there
bunches of turnips are seen flying in the air
over the heads of the people. Groups of apple-women,
with straw pads on their crushed bonnets,
and coarse shawls crossing their bosoms,
sit on their porter’s knots, chatting in Irish, and
smoking short pipes; every passer-by is hailed
with the cry of, “Want a baskit, yer honor?”
The porter, trembling under the piled-up
hamper, trots along the street, with his teeth
clenched and shirt wet with the weight, and
staggering at every step he takes.</p>

<p>Inside, the market all is bustle and confusion.
The people walk along with their eyes fixed on
the goods, and frowning with thought. Men in
all costumes, from the coster in his corduroy suit
to the greengrocer in his blue apron, sweep past.
A countryman, in an old straw hat and dusty
boots, occasionally draws down the anger of a
woman for walking about with his hands in
the pockets of his smock-frock, and is asked,
“if that is the way to behave on a market-day?”
Even the granite pillars cannot stop
the crowd, for it separates and rushes past them,
like the tide by a bridge pier. At every turn
there is a fresh odour to sniff at; either the
bitter aromatic perfume of the herbalists’ shops
breaks upon you, or the scent of oranges, then
of apples, and then of onions is caught for an
instant as you move along. The brocoli tied
up in square packets, the white heads tinged
slightly red, as it were, with the sunshine,&mdash;the
sieves of crimson love-apples, polished
like china,&mdash;the bundles of white glossy leeks,
their roots dangling like fringe,&mdash;the celery,
with its pinky stalks and bright green tops,&mdash;the
dark purple pickling-cabbages,&mdash;the scarlet
carrots,&mdash;the white knobs of turnips,&mdash;the bright
yellow balls of oranges, and the rich brown
coats of the chesnuts&mdash;attract the eye on every
side. Then there are the apple-merchants, with
their fruit of all colours, from the pale yellow
green to the bright crimson, and the baskets
ranged in rows on the pavement before the
little shops. Round these the customers stand
examining the stock, then whispering together
over their bargain, and counting their money.
“Give you four shillings for this here lot,
master,” says a coster, speaking for his three
companions. “Four and six is my price,”
answers the salesman. “Say four, and it’s a
bargain,” continues the man. “I said my price,”
returns the dealer; “go and look round, and
see if you can get ’em cheaper; if not, come back.
I only wants what’s fair.” The men, taking the
salesman’s advice, move on. The walnut merchant,
with the group of women before his shop,
peeling the fruit, their fingers stained deep brown,
is busy with the Irish purchasers. The onion
stores, too, are surrounded by Hibernians, feeling
and pressing the gold-coloured roots, whose
dry skins crackle as they are handled. Cases of
lemons in their white paper jackets, and blue
grapes, just seen above the sawdust are ranged
about, and in some places the ground is slippery
as ice from the refuse leaves and walnut
husks scattered over the pavement.</p>

<p>Against the railings of St. Paul’s Church are
hung baskets and slippers for sale, and near
the public-house is a party of countrymen preparing
their bunches of pretty coloured grass&mdash;brown
and glittering, as if it had been bronzed.
Between the spikes of the railing are piled up
square cakes of green turf for larks; and at the
pump, boys, who probably have passed the previous
night in the baskets about the market, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
washing, and the water dripping from their hair
that hangs in points over the face. The kerb-stone
is blocked up by a crowd of admiring
lads, gathered round the bird-catcher’s green
stand, and gazing at the larks beating their
breasts against their cages. The owner, whose
boots are red with the soil of the brick-field,
shouts, as he looks carelessly around, “A cock
linnet for tuppence,” and then hits at the youths
who are poking through the bars at the fluttering
birds.</p>

<p>Under the Piazza the costers purchase their
flowers (in pots) which they exchange in the
streets for old clothes. Here is ranged a small
garden of flower-pots, the musk and mignonette
smelling sweetly, and the scarlet geraniums,
with a perfect glow of coloured air about the
flowers, standing out in rich contrast with the
dark green leaves of the evergreens behind them.
“There’s myrtles, and larels, and boxes,” says
one of the men selling them, “and there’s a
harbora witus, and lauristiners, and that bushy
shrub with pink spots is heath.” Men and
women, selling different articles, walk about
under the cover of the colonnade. One has seed-cake,
another small-tooth and other combs,
others old caps, or pig’s feet, and one hawker
of knives, razors, and short hatchets, may occasionally
be seen driving a bargain with a countryman,
who stands passing his thumb over the
blade to test its keenness. Between the pillars
are the coffee-stalls, with their large tin cans
and piles of bread and butter, and protected
from the wind by paper screens and sheets
thrown over clothes-horses; inside these little
parlours, as it were, sit the coffee-drinkers
on chairs and benches, some with a bunch of
cabbages on their laps, blowing the steam from
their saucers, others, with their mouths full,
munching away at their slices, as if not a
moment could be lost. One or two porters are
there besides, seated on their baskets, breakfasting
with their knots on their heads.</p>

<p>As you walk away from this busy scene, you
meet in every street barrows and costers hurrying
home. The pump in the market is now
surrounded by a cluster of chattering wenches
quarrelling over whose turn it is to water their
drooping violets, and on the steps of Covent
Garden Theatre are seated the shoeless girls,
tying up the halfpenny and penny bundles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Green” Fruit Selling in the
Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The fruit selling of the streets of London is
of a distinct character from that of vegetable or
fish selling, inasmuch as fruit is for the most
part a luxury, and the others are principally
necessaries.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the consumption of
fruit supplies a fair criterion of the condition
of the working classes, but the costermongers, as
a body of traders, are little observant, so that it
is not easy to derive from them much information
respecting the classes who are their customers,
or as to how their custom is influenced
by the circumstances of the times. One man,
however, told me that during the last panic he
sold hardly anything beyond mere necessaries.
Other street-sellers to whom I spoke could not
comprehend what a panic meant.</p>

<p>The most intelligent costers whom I conversed
with agreed that they now sold less
fruit than ever to working people, but perhaps
more than ever to the dwellers in the smaller
houses in the suburbs, and to shopkeepers who
were not in a large way of business. One man
sold baking apples, but not above a peck on an
average weekly, to women whom he knew to be
the wives of working men, for he had heard them
say, “Dear me, I didn’t think it had been so late,
there’s hardly time to get the dumplings baked
before my husband leaves work for his dinner.”
The course of my inquiries has shown me&mdash;and
many employers whom I have conversed with
are of a similar opinion&mdash;that the well-conducted
and skilful artisan, who, in spite of slop competition,
continues to enjoy a fair rate of wages,
usually makes a prudent choice of a wife, who
perhaps has been a servant in a respectable
family. Such a wife is probably “used to
cooking,” and will oft enough make a pie or
pudding to eke out the cold meat of the Monday’s
dinner, or “for a treat for the children.”
With the mass of the working people, however,
it is otherwise. The wife perhaps has been
reared to incessant toil with her needle, and
does not know how to make even a dumpling.
Even if she possess as much knowledge, she
may have to labour as well as her husband, and
if their joint earnings enable them to have “the
added pudding,” there is still the trouble of
making it; and, after a weary week’s work, rest
is often a greater enjoyment than a gratification
of the palate. Thus something easily
prepared, and carried off to the oven, is preferred.
The slop-workers of all trades never,
I believe, taste either fruit pie or pudding, unless
a penny one be bought at a shop or in the
street; and even among mechanics who are used
to better diet, the pies and puddings, when wages
are reduced, or work grows slack, are the first
things that are dispensed with. “When the
money doesn’t come in, sir,” one working-man
said to me, “we mustn’t think of puddings, but
of <i>bread</i>.”</p>

<p>A costermonger, more observant than the
rest, told me that there were some classes to
whom he had rarely sold fruit, and whom he had
seldom seen buy any. Among these he mentioned
sweeps, scavengers, dustmen, nightmen, gas-pipe-layers,
and sewer-men, who preferred
to any fruit, “something to bite in the mouth,
such as a penn’orth of gin.” My informant
believed that this abstinence from fruit was
common to all persons engaged in such offensive
trades as fiddle-string making, gut-dressing
for whip-makers or sausage-makers, knackers,
&amp;c. He was confident of it, as far as his
own experience extended. It is, moreover, less
common for the women of the town, of the poorer
sort, to expend pence in fruit than in such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as whelks, shrimps, or winks, to say nothing of
gin. Persons, whose stomachs may be one week
jaded to excess, and the next be deprived of a
sufficiency of proper food, seek for stimulants,
or, as they term it, “relishes.”</p>

<p>The fruit-sellers, meaning thereby those who
deal principally in fruit in the season, are the
more intelligent costermongers. The calculation
as to what a bushel of apples, for instance,
will make in half or quarter pecks, puzzles the
more ignorant, and they buy “second-hand,” or
of a middle-man, and consequently dearer. The
Irish street-sellers do not meddle much with
fruit, excepting a few of the very best class
of them, and they “do well in it,” I was
told, “they have such tongue.”</p>

<p>The improvement in the quality of the fruit
and vegetables now in our markets, and consequently
in the necessaries and luxuries of the
poorer classes, is very great. Prizes and medals
have been deservedly awarded to the skilled and
persevering gardeners who have increased the
size and heightened the flavour of the pine-apple
or the strawberry&mdash;who have given a thinner
rind to the peach, or a fuller gush of juice to
the apricot,&mdash;or who have enhanced alike the
bloom, the weight, and the size of the fruit of
the vine, whether as regards the classic “bunch,”
or the individual grape. Still these are benefits
confined mainly to the rich. But there is another
class of growers who have rendered greater services
and whose services have been comparatively
unnoticed. I allude to those gardeners
who have improved or introduced our <i>every
day</i> vegetables or fruit, such as now form the
cheapest and most grateful and healthy enjoyments
of the humbler portion of the community.
I may instance the introduction of rhubarb,
which was comparatively unknown until Mr.
Myatt, now of Deptford, cultivated it thirty
years ago. He then, for the first time, carried
seven bundles of rhubarb into the Borough
market. Of these he could sell only three,
and he took four back with him. Mr. Myatt
could not recollect the price he received for
the first rhubarb he ever sold in public, but he
told me that the stalks were only about half the
substance of those he now produces. People
laughed at him for offering “physic pies,” but
he persevered, and I have shown what the sale
of rhubarb now is.</p>

<p>Moreover, the importation of foreign “pines”
may be cited as another instance of the increased
luxuries of the poor. The trade in this commodity
was unknown until the year 1842. At
that period Mr. James Wood and Messrs. Claypole
and Son, of Liverpool, imported them
from the Bahamas, a portion being conveyed
to Messrs. Keeling and Hunt, of London. Since
that period the trade has gradually increased
until, instead of 1000 pines being sent to Liverpool,
and a portion of them conveyed to London,
as at first, 200,000 pines are now imported
to London alone. The fruit is brought over in
“trees,” stowed in numbers from ten to thirty
thousand, in galleries constructed fore and aft in
the vessel, which is so extravagantly fragrant,
that it has to be ventilated to abate the odour.
But for this importation, and but for the trade
having become a part of the costermonger’s
avocation, hundreds and thousands in London
would never have tasted a pine-apple. The
quality of the fruit has, I am informed, been
greatly improved since its first introduction;
the best description of “pines” which Covent-garden
can supply having been sent out to graft,
to increase the size and flavour of the Bahaman
products, and this chiefly for the regalement of
the palates of the humbler classes of London.
The supply from the Bahamas is considered inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Pine-apples, when they were first introduced,
were a rich harvest to the costermonger. They
made more money “working” these than any
other article. The pines cost them about 4<i>d.</i>
each, one with the other, good and bad together,
and were sold by the costermonger at from 1<i>s.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The public were not aware then that
the pines they sold were “salt-water touched,”
and the people bought them as fast as they
could be sold, not only by the whole one, but
at 1<i>d.</i> a slice,&mdash;for those who could not afford
to give 1<i>s.</i> for the novelty, had a slice as a
taste for 1<i>d.</i> The costermongers used then
to have flags flying at the head of their barrows,
and gentlefolk would stop them in the
streets; indeed, the sale for pines was chiefly
among “the gentry.” The poorer people&mdash;sweeps,
dustmen, cabmen&mdash;occasionally had
pennyworths, “just for the fun of the thing;”
but gentlepeople, I was told, used to buy a whole
one to take home, so that all the family might
have a taste. One costermonger assured me
that he had taken 22<i>s.</i> a day during the rage for
pines, when they first came up.</p>

<p>I have before stated that when the season is
in its height the costermonger prefers the vending
of fruit to the traffic in either fish or vegetables;
those, however, who have regular rounds
and “a connection,” must supply their customers
with vegetables, if not fish, as well as fruit, but
the costers prefer to devote themselves principally
to fruit. I am unable, therefore, to draw
a comparison between what a coster realises in
fruit, and what in fish, as the two seasons are
not contemporary. The fruit sale is, however,
as I have shown in p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, the costermonger’s
harvest.</p>

<p>All the costermongers with whom I conversed
represented that the greater cheapness and
abundance of fruit had been anything but a
benefit to them, nor did the majority seem to
know whether fruit was scarcer or more plentiful
one year than another, unless in remarkable
instances. Of the way in which the introduction
of foreign fruit had influenced their trade, they
knew nothing. If questioned on the subject, the
usual reply was, that things got worse, and
people didn’t buy so much fruit as they did
half-a-dozen years back, and so less was sold.
That these men hold such opinions must be
accounted for mainly by the increase in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
numbers, of which I have before spoken, and
from their general ignorance.</p>

<p>The fruit of which there is the readiest sale
in the streets is one usually considered among
the least useful&mdash;cherries. Probably, the greater
eagerness on the part of the poorer classes to
purchase this fruit arises from its being the first
of the fresh “green” kind which our gardens
supply for street-sale after the winter and the
early spring. An intelligent costermonger suggested
other reasons. “Poor people,” he said,
“like a <i>quantity</i> of any fruit, and no fruit is
cheaper than cherries at 1<i>d.</i> a pound, at which I
have sold some hundreds of pounds’ weight.
I’m satisfied, sir, that if a cherry could be grown
that weighed a pound, and was of a finer flavour
than ever was known before, poor people would
rather have a number of little ones, even if they
was less weight and inferior quality. Then boys
buy, I think, more cherries than other fruit;
because, after they have eaten ’em, they can
play at cherry-stones.”</p>

<p>From all I can learn, the halfpenny-worth
of fruit purchased most eagerly by a poor man,
or by a child to whom the possession of a
halfpenny is a rarity, is cherries. I asked a
man “with a good connection,” according to
his own account, as to who were his customers
for cherries. He enumerated ladies and gentlemen;
working-people; wagoners and carters
(who “slipped them quietly into their pockets,”
he said); parlour-livers (so he called the occupants
of parlours); maid-servants; and soldiers.
“Soldiers,” I was told, “are very fond
of something for a change from their feed, which
is about as regular as a prison’s.”</p>

<p>The currant, and the fruit of the same useful
genus, the gooseberry, are sold largely by the
costermongers. The price of the currants is 1<i>d.</i>
or 2<i>d.</i> the half-pint, 1<i>d.</i> being the more usual
charge. Of red currants there is the greatest
supply, but the black “go off better.” The
humbler classes buy a half-pint of the latter for a
dumpling, and “they’re reckoned,” said my informant,
“capital for a sore throat, either in jam
or a pudding.” Gooseberries are also retailed
by the half-pint, and are cheaper than currants&mdash;perhaps
&frac12;<i>d.</i> the half-pint is the average
street-price. The working-classes do not use
ripe gooseberries, as they do ripe currants, for
dumplings, but they are sold in greater quantities
and may be said to constitute, when first
introduced, as other productions do afterwards,
the working-people’s Sunday dessert. “Only
you go on board a cheap steamer to Greenwich,
on a fine summer Sunday,” observed a street-seller
to me, “and you’ll see lots of young
women with gooseberries in their handkerchiefs
in their laps. Servant-maids is very good customers
for such things as gooseberries, for they
always has a penny to spare.” The costers sell
green gooseberries for dumplings, and sometimes
to the extent of a fourth of the ripe fruit.
The price of green gooseberries is generally &frac12;<i>d.</i>
a pint dearer than the ripe.</p>

<p>When strawberries descend to such a price
as places them at the costermonger’s command,
the whole fraternity is busily at work, and as
the sale can easily be carried on by women and
children, the coster’s family take part in the
sale, offering at the corners of streets the fragrant
pottle, with the crimson fruit just showing
beneath the green leaves at the top. Of all
cries, too, perhaps that of “hoboys” is the
most agreeable. Strawberries, however, according
to all accounts, are consumed least of all
fruits by the poor. “They like something more
solid,” I was told, “something to bite at, and
a penny pottle of strawberries is only like a
taste; what’s more, too, the really good fruit
never finds its way into penny pottles.” The
coster’s best customers are dwellers in the
suburbs, who purchase strawberries on a Sunday
especially, for dessert, for they think that
they get them fresher in that way than by
reserving them from the Saturday night, and
many are tempted by seeing or hearing them
cried in the streets. There is also a good Sunday
sale about the steam-wharfs, to people
going “on the river,” especially when young
women and children are members of a party,
and likewise in the “clerk districts,” as Camden-town
and Camberwell. Very few pottles,
comparatively, are sold in public-houses; “they
don’t go well down with the beer at all,” I was
told. The city people are good customers for
street strawberries, conveying them home. Good
strawberries are 2<i>d.</i> a pottle in the streets when
the season is at its height. Inferior are 1<i>d.</i>
These are the most frequent prices. In raspberries
the coster does little, selling them only
to such customers as use them for the sake of
jam or for pastry. The price is from 6<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the pottle, 9<i>d.</i> being the average.</p>

<p>The great staple of the street trade in green
fruit is apples. These are first sold by the
travelling costers, by the measure, for pies, &amp;c.,
and to the classes I have described as the
makers of pies. The apples, however, are soon
vended in penny or halfpenny-worths, and then
they are bought by the poor who have a spare
penny for the regalement of their children or
themselves, and they are eaten without any
preparation. Pears are sold to the same classes
as are apples. The average price of apples, as
sold by the costermonger, is 4<i>s.</i> a bushel, and
six a penny. The sale in halfpenny and pennyworths
is very great. Indeed the costermongers
sell about half the apples brought to the markets,
and I was told that for one pennyworth of
apples bought in a shop forty were bought in
the street. Pears are 9<i>d.</i> a bushel, generally,
dearer than apples, but, numerically, they run
more to the bushel.</p>

<p>The costers purchase the French apples at
the wharf, close to London-bridge, on the
Southwark side. They give 10<i>s.</i>, 12<i>s.</i>, 18<i>s.</i>,
or 20<i>s.</i> for a case containing four bushels.
They generally get from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> profit on a
bushel of English, but on the French apples
they make a clear profit of from 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a
bushel, and would make more, but the fruit some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>times
“turns out damaged.” This extra profit is
owing to the French giving better measure, their
four bushels being about five market bushels, as
there is much straw packed up with the English
apples, and none with the French.</p>

<p>Plums and damsons are less purchased by the
humbler classes than apples, or than any other
larger sized fruit which is supplied abundantly.
“If I’ve worked plums or damsons,” said an
experienced costermonger, “and have told any
woman pricing them: ‘They don’t look so ripe,
but they’re all the better for a pie,’ she’s answered,
‘O, a plum pie’s too fine for us, and
what’s more, it takes too much sugar.’” They
are sold principally for desserts, and in penny-worths,
at 1<i>d.</i> the half-pint for good, and &frac12; <i>d.</i>
for inferior. Green-gages are 50 per cent.
higher. Some costers sell a cheap lot of plums
to the eating-house keepers, and sell them
more readily than they sell apples to the same
parties.</p>

<p>West Indian pine-apples are, as regards the
street sale, disposed of more in the city than
elsewhere. They are bought by clerks and
warehousemen, who carry them to their suburban
homes. The slices at &frac12;<i>d.</i> and 1<i>d.</i> are
bought principally by boys. The average price
of a “good street pine” is 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Peaches are an occasional sale with the costermongers’,

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Orange and Nut Market.</span></h3>

<p>In Houndsditch there is a market supported
principally by costermongers, who there purchase
their oranges, lemons, and nuts. This
market is entirely in the hands of the Jews; and
although a few tradesmen may attend it to
buy grapes, still it derives its chief custom from
the street-dealers who say they can make far
better bargains with the Israelites, (as they never
refuse an offer,) than they can with the Covent-garden
salesmen, who generally cling to their
prices. This market is known by the name of
“Duke’s-place,” although its proper title is
St. James’s-place. The nearest road to it is
through Duke’s-street, and the two titles have
been so confounded that at length the mistake
has grown into a custom.</p>

<p>Duke’s-place&mdash;as the costers call it&mdash;is a
large square yard, with the iron gates of a
synagogue in one corner, a dead wall forming
one entire side of the court, and a gas-lamp on
a circular pavement in the centre. The place
looks as if it were devoted to money-making&mdash;for
it is quiet and dirty. Not a gilt letter is to
be seen over a doorway; there is no display of
gaudy colour, or sheets of plate-glass, such as
we see in a crowded thoroughfare when a customer
is to be caught by show. As if the
merchants knew their trade was certain, they
are content to let the London smoke do their
painter’s work. On looking at the shops
in this quarter, the idea forces itself upon one
that they are in the last stage of dilapidation.
Never did property in Chancery look more
ruinous. Each dwelling seems as though a fire
had raged in it, for not a shop in the market
has a window to it; and, beyond the few sacks
of nuts exposed for sale, they are empty, the
walls within being blackened with dirt, and the
paint without blistered in the sun, while the
door-posts are worn round with the shoulders
of the customers, and black as if charred. A
few sickly hens wander about, turning over the
heaps of dried leaves that the oranges have
been sent over in, or roost the time away on the
shafts and wheels of the nearest truck. Excepting
on certain days, there is little or no
business stirring, so that many of the shops
have one or two shutters up, as if a death had
taken place, and the yard is quiet as an inn of
court. At a little distance the warehouses,
with their low ceilings, open fronts, and black
sides, seem like dark holes or coal-stores; and,
but for the mahogany backs of chairs showing
at the first floors, you would scarcely believe
the houses to be inhabited, much more to be
elegantly furnished as they are. One of the
drawing-rooms that I entered here was warm
and red with morocco leather, Spanish mahogany,
and curtains and Turkey carpets; while
the ormolu chandelier and the gilt frames of the
looking-glass and pictures twinkled at every
point in the fire-light.</p>

<p>The householders in Duke’s-place are all of
the Jewish persuasion, and among the costers a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
saying has sprung up about it. When a man
has been out of work for some time, he is said to
be “Cursed, like a pig in Duke’s-place.”</p>

<p>Almost every shop has a Scripture name over
it, and even the public-houses are of the Hebrew
faith, their signs appealing to the followers of
those trades which most abound with Jews.
There is the “Jeweller’s Arms,” patronised
greatly of a Sunday morning, when the Israelite
jewellers attend to exchange their trinkets and
barter amongst themselves. Very often the
counter before “the bar” here may be seen covered
with golden ornaments, and sparkling with
precious stones, amounting in value to thousands
of pounds. The landlord of this house of call
is licensed to <i>manufacture</i> tobacco and cigars.
There is also the “Fishmongers’ Arms,” the
resort of the vendors of fried soles; here, in the
evening, a concert takes place, the performers
and audience being Jews. The landlord of this
house too is licensed to manufacture tobacco
and cigars. Entering one of these houses I
found a bill announcing a “Bible to be raffled
for, the property of &mdash;&mdash;.” And, lastly, there
is “Benjamin’s Coffee-house,” open to old
clothesmen; and here, again, the proprietor is
a licensed tobacco-manufacturer. These facts
are mentioned to show the untiring energy of
the Jew when anything is to be gained, and to
give an instance of the curious manner in which
this people support each other.</p>

<p>Some of the nut and orange shops in
Duke’s-place it would be impossible to describe.
At one sat an old woman, with jet-black
hair and a wrinkled face, nursing an
infant, and watching over a few matted baskets
of nuts ranged on a kind of carpenter’s bench
placed upon the pavement. The interior of the
house was as empty as if it had been to let,
excepting a few bits of harness hanging against
the wall, and an old salt-box nailed near the
gas-lamp, in which sat a hen, “hatching,” as I
was told. At another was an excessively stout
Israelite mother, with crisp negro’s hair and
long gold earrings, rolling her child on the
table used for sorting the nuts. Here the black
walls had been chalked over with scores, and
every corner was filled up with sacks and orange-cases.
Before one warehouse a family of six,
from the father to the infant, were busy washing
walnuts in a huge tub with a trap in the side,
and around them were ranged measures of the
wet fruit. The Jewish women are known to
make the fondest parents; and in Duke’s-place
there certainly was no lack of fondlings. Inside
almost every parlour a child was either being
nursed or romped with, and some little things
were being tossed nearly to the ceiling, and
caught, screaming with enjoyment, in the jewelled
hands of the delighted mother. At other
shops might be seen a circle of three or four
women&mdash;some old as if grandmothers, grouped
admiringly round a hook-nosed infant, tickling
it and poking their fingers at it in a frenzy of
affection.</p>

<p>The counters of these shops are generally
placed in the open streets like stalls, and the
shop itself is used as a store to keep the stock in.
On these counters are ranged the large matting
baskets, some piled up with dark-brown polished
chestnuts&mdash;shining like a racer’s neck&mdash;others
filled with wedge-shaped Brazil-nuts, and rough
hairy cocoa-nuts. There are heaps, too, of
newly-washed walnuts, a few showing their
white crumpled kernels as a sample of their
excellence. Before every doorway are long pot-bellied
boxes of oranges, with the yellow fruit
just peeping between the laths on top, and
lemons&mdash;yet green&mdash;are ranged about in their
paper jackets to ripen in the air.</p>

<p>In front of one store the paving-stones were
soft with the sawdust emptied from the grape-cases,
and the floor of the shop itself was
whitened with the dry powder. Here stood a
man in a long tasselled smoking-cap, puffing
with his bellows at the blue bunches on a tray,
and about him were the boxes with the paper
lids thrown back, and the round sea-green
berries just rising above the sawdust as if
floating in it. Close by, was a group of dark-eyed
women bending over an orange-case, picking
out the rotten from the good fruit, while a
sallow-complexioned girl was busy with her
knife scooping out the damaged parts, until,
what with sawdust and orange-peel, the air
smelt like the pit of a circus.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen in this strange place
that did not, in some way or another, appertain
to Jewish customs. A woman, with a heavy
gold chain round her neck, went past, carrying
an old green velvet bonnet covered with feathers,
and a fur tippet, that she had either recently
purchased or was about to sell. Another woman,
whose features showed her to be a Gentile, was
hurrying toward the slop-shop in the Minories
with a richly quilted satin-lined coat done up in
her shawl, and the market-basket by her side,
as if the money due for the work were to be
spent directly for housekeeping.</p>

<p>At the corner of Duke’s-street was a stall
kept by a Jew, who sold things that are eaten
only by the Hebrews. Here in a yellow pie-dish
were pieces of stewed apples floating in a
thick puce-coloured sauce.</p>

<p>One man that I spoke to told me that he
considered his Sunday morning’s work a very
bad one if he did not sell his five or six hundred
bushels of nuts of different kinds. He had
taken 150<i>l.</i> that day of the street-sellers, and
usually sold his 100<i>l.</i> worth of goods in a morning.
Many others did the same as himself. Here
I met with every attention, and was furnished
with some valuable statistical information concerning
the street-trade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Orange and Lemon Selling in the
Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Of foreign fruits, the oranges and nuts supply
by far the greater staple for the street trade,
and, therefore, demand a brief, but still a fuller,
notice than other articles.</p>

<p>Oranges were first sold in the streets at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
close of Elizabeth’s reign. So rapidly had the
trade increased, that four years after her death,
or in 1607, Ben Jonson classes “orange-wives,”
for noisiness, with “fish-wives.” These women
at first carried the oranges in baskets on their
heads; barrows were afterwards used; and now
trays are usually slung to the shoulders.</p>

<p>Oranges are brought to this country in cases
or boxes, containing from 500 to 900 oranges.
From official tables, it appears that between
250,000,000 and 300,000,000 of oranges and
lemons are now yearly shipped to England.
They are sold wholesale, principally at public
sales, in lots of eight boxes, the price at such
sales varying greatly, according to the supply
and the quality. The supply continues to arrive
from October to August.</p>

<p>Oranges are bought by the retailers in Duke’s-place
and in Covent-Garden; but the costermongers
nearly all resort to Duke’s-place, and
the shopkeepers to Covent-Garden. They are
sold in baskets of 200 or 300; they are also disposed
of by the hundred, a half-hundred being
the smallest quantity sold in Duke’s-place.
These hundreds, however, number 110, containing
10 double “hands,” a single hand being 5
oranges. The price in December was 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 4<i>s.</i> the hundred. They are rarely
lower than 4<i>s.</i> about Christmas, as there is then
a better demand for them. The damaged oranges
are known as “specks,” and the purchaser runs
the risk of specks forming a portion of the contents
of a basket, as he is not allowed to empty
it for the examination of the fruit: but some
salesmen agree to change the specks. A month
after Christmas, oranges are generally cheaper,
and become dearer again about May, when there
is a great demand for the supply of the fairs and
races.</p>

<p>Oranges are sold by all classes connected with
the fruit, flower, or vegetable trade of the streets.
The majority of the street-sellers are, however,
women and children, and the great part of these
are Irish. It has been computed that, when
oranges are “at their best” (generally about
Easter), there are 4,000 persons, including stall-keepers,
selling oranges in the metropolis and
its suburbs; while there are generally 3,000 out
of this number “working” oranges&mdash;that is,
hawking them from street to street: of these, 300
attend at the doors of the theatres, saloons, &amp;c.
Many of those “working” the theatres confine
their trade to oranges, while the other dealers
rarely do so, but unite with them the sale of nuts
of some kind. Those who sell only oranges, or
only nuts, are mostly children, and of the poorest
class. The smallness of the sum required
to provide a stock of oranges (a half-hundred
being 15<i>d.</i> or 18<i>d.</i>), enables the poor, who cannot
raise “stock-money” sufficient to purchase anything
else, to trade upon a few oranges.</p>

<p>The regular costers rarely buy oranges until
the spring, except, perhaps, for Sunday afternoon
sale&mdash;though this, as I said before, they
mostly object to. In the spring, however, they
stock their barrows with oranges. One man told
me that, four or five years back, he had sold in a
day 2,000 oranges that he picked up as a bargain.
They did not cost him half a farthing each; he
said he “cleared 2<i>l.</i> by the spec.” At the same
period he could earn 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> on a Sunday
afternoon by the sale of oranges in the street;
but now he could not earn 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A poor Irishwoman, neither squalid in appearance
nor ragged in dress, though looking
pinched and wretched, gave me the subjoined
account; when I saw her, resting with her
basket of oranges near Coldbath-fields prison,
she told me she almost wished she was inside
of it, but for the “childer.” Her history was
one common to her <span class="lock">class&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was brought over here, sir, when I was a
girl, but my father and mother died two or three
years after. I was in service then, and very
good service I continued in as a maid-of-all-work,
and very kind people I met; yes, indeed,
though I was Irish and a Catholic, and they was
English Protistants. I saved a little money
there, and got married. My husband’s a labourer;
and when he’s in full worruk he can
earn 12<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> a week, for he’s a good hand
and a harrud-worruking man, and we do middlin’
thin. He’s out of worruk now, and I’m
forced to thry and sill a few oranges to keep a
bit of life in us, and my husband minds the
childer. Bad as I do, I can do 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> a day
profit betther than him, poor man! for he’s tall
and big, and people thinks, if he goes round
with a few oranges, it’s just from idleniss; and
the Lorrud above knows he’ll always worruk
whin he can. He goes sometimes whin I’m
harrud tired. One of us must stay with the
childer, for the youngist is not three and the
ildest not five. We don’t live, we starruve. We
git a few ’taties, and sometimes a plaice. To-day
I’ve not taken 3<i>d.</i> as yit, sir, and it’s past
three. Oh, no, indeed and indeed, thin, I dont
make 9<i>d.</i> a day. We live accordingly, for there’s
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a week for rint. I have very little harrut
to go into the public-houses to sill oranges, for
they begins flying out about the Pope and Cardinal
Wiseman, as if I had anything to do with
it. And that’s another reason why I like my
husband to stay at home, and me to go out, because
he’s a hasty man, and might get into
throuble. I don’t know what will become of us,
if times don’t turn.”</p>

<p>On calling upon this poor woman on the following
day, I found her and her children absent.
The husband had got employment at some distance,
and she had gone to see if she could not
obtain a room 3<i>d.</i> a week cheaper, and lodge
near the place of work.</p>

<p>According to the Board of Trade returns,
there are nearly two hundred millions of
oranges annually imported into this country.
About one-third of these are sold wholesale in
London, and one-fourth of the latter quantity disposed
of retail in the streets. The returns I have
procured, touching the London sale, prove that
no less than 15,500,000 are sold yearly by the
street-sellers. The retail price of these may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
said to be, upon an average, 5<i>s.</i> per 110, and
this would give us about 35,000<i>l.</i> for the gross
sum of money laid out every year, in the streets,
in the matter of oranges alone.</p>

<p>The street lemon-trade is now insignificant,
lemons having become a more important article
of commerce since the law required foreign-bound
ships to be provided with lemon-juice.
The street-sale is chiefly in the hands of
the Jews and the Irish. It does not, however,
call for special notice here.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Nut Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The sellers of foreign hazel nuts are principally
women and children, but the stall-keepers, and
oftentimes the costermongers, sell them with
other “goods.” The consumption of them is
immense, the annual export from Tarragona
being little short of 8,000 tons. They are to be
found in every poor shop in London, as well as
in the large towns; they are generally to be
seen on every street-stall, in every country village,
at every fair, and on every race-ground.
The supply is from Gijon and Tarragona. The
Gijon nuts are the “Spanish,” or “fresh” nuts.
They are sold at public sales, in barrels of three
bushels each, the price being from 35<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i>
The nuts from Tarragona, whence comes the
great supply, are known as “Barcelonas,” and
they are kiln-dried before they are shipped.
Hence the Barcelonas will “keep,” and the
Spanish will not. The Spanish are coloured
with the fumes of sulphur, by the Jews in
Duke’s-place.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that nuts supply
employment to a number of girls in Spain, and
then yield the means of a scanty subsistence to
a number of girls (with or without parents) in
England.</p>

<p>The prattle and the laughter (according to
Inglis) of the Spanish girls who sort, find no
parallel however among the London girls who
sell the nuts. The appearance of the latter is
often wretched. In the winter months they may
be seen as if stupified with cold, and with the
listlessness, not to say apathy, of those whose
diet is poor in quantity and insufficient in
amount.</p>

<p>Very few costermongers buy nuts (as hazel
nuts are always called) at the public sales&mdash;only
those whose dealings are of a wholesale character,
and they are anything but regular attendants
at the sales. The street-sellers derive nearly
the whole of their supply from Duke’s-place.
The principal times of business are Friday
afternoons and Sunday mornings. Those who
have “capital” buy on the Friday, when they
say they can make 10<i>s.</i> go as far as 12<i>s.</i> on the
Sunday. The “Barcelonas” are from 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> to
6<i>d.</i> a quart to the street-sellers. The cob-nuts,
which are the large size, used by the pastry-cooks
for mottos, &amp;c., are 2<i>d.</i> and 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> the quart,
but they are generally destitute of a kernel.
A quart contains from 100 to 180 nuts, according
to the size. The costermongers buy
somewhat largely when nuts are 3<i>d.</i> the quart;
they then, and not unfrequently, stock their
barrows with nuts entirely, but 2<i>s.</i> a day is
reckoned excellent earnings at this trade. “It’s
the worst living of all, sir,” I was told, “on
nuts.” The sale in the streets is at the fruit-stalls,
in the public-houses, on board the
steamers, and at the theatre doors. They are
sold by the same class as the oranges, and a
stock may be procured for a smaller sum even
than is required for oranges. By the outlay of
1<i>s.</i> many an Irishwoman can send out her two
or three children with nuts, reserving some for
herself. Seven-eighths of the nuts imported
are sold, I am assured, in the open air.</p>

<p>Some of the costermongers who are to be
found in Battersea-fields, and who attend the
fairs and races, get through 5<i>s.</i> worth of nuts in
a day, but only exceptionally. These men have
a sort of portable shooting-gallery. The customer
fires a kind of rifle, loaded with a dart,
and according to the number marked on the
centre, or on the encircling rings of a board
which forms the head of the stall, and which
may be struck by the dart, is the number of
nuts payable by the stall-keeper for the halfpenny
“fire.”</p>

<p>The Brazil nuts, which are now sold largely
in the streets at twelve to sixteen a penny, were
not known in this country as an article of commerce
before 1824. They are sold by the peck&mdash;2<i>s.</i>
being the ordinary price&mdash;in Duke’s-place.</p>

<p>Coker-nuts&mdash;as they are now generally called,
and indeed “entered” as such at the Custom-house,
and so written by Mr. Mc Culloch, to
distinguish them from cocoa, or the berries
of the cacâo, used for chocolate, etc.&mdash;are
brought from the West Indies, both British
and Spanish, and Brazil. They are used as
dunnage in the sugar ships, being interposed
between the hogsheads, to steady them and
prevent their being flung about. The coker-nut
was introduced into England in 1690. They
are sold at public sales and otherwise, and bring
from 10<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i> per 100. Coker-nuts are now
used at fairs to “top” the sticks.</p>

<p>The costermongers rarely speculate in coker-nuts
now, as the boys will not buy them unless
cut, and it is almost impossible to tell how the
coker-nut will “open.” The interior is sold in
halfpenny-worths and penny-worths. These
nuts are often “worked with a drum.” There
may be now forty coker-nut men in the street
trade, but not one in ten confines himself to the
article.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the dry or ripe walnuts
sold in the streets is from Bordeaux. They are
sold at public sales, in barrels of three bushels
each, realising 21<i>s.</i> to 25<i>s.</i> a barrel. They are
retailed at from eight to twenty a penny, and
are sold by all classes of street-traders.</p>

<p>A little girl, who looked stunted and wretched,
and who did not know her age (which might be
eleven), told me she was sent out by her mother
with six halfpenny-worth of nuts, and she must
carry back 6<i>d.</i> or she would be beat. She
had no father, and could neither read nor write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Her mother was an Englishwoman, <i>she believed</i>,
and sold oranges. She had heard of God; he
was “Our Father who art in heaven.” She’d
heard that said. She did not know the Lord’s
Prayer; had never heard of it; did not know
who the Lord was; perhaps the Lord Mayor,
but she had never been before him. She went
into public-houses with her nuts, but did not
know whether she was ever insulted or not; she
did not know what insulted was, but she was
never badly used. She often went into tap-rooms
with her nuts, just to warm herself. A
man once gave her some hot beer, which made
her ill. Her mother was kind enough to her,
and never beat her but for not taking home 6<i>d.</i>
She had a younger brother that did as she did.
She had bread and potatoes to eat, and sometimes
tea, and sometimes herrings. Her mother
didn’t get tipsy (at first she did not know what
was meant by tipsy) <i>above</i> once a week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Roasted Chestnuts and Apples.</span></h3>

<p>How long the street-trade in roasted chestnuts
has been carried on I find no means of ascertaining
precisely, but it is unquestionably one
of the oldest of the public traffics. Before
potato-cans were introduced, the sale of roasted
chestnuts was far greater than it is now.</p>

<p>It is difficult to compute the number of
roasted chestnut-sellers at present in the streets.
It is probable that they outnumber 1,000, for
I noticed that on a cold day almost every street
fruit-seller, man or woman, had roasted chestnuts
for sale.</p>

<p>Sometimes the chestnuts are roasted in the
streets, in a huge iron apparatus, made expressly
for the purpose, and capable of cooking
perhaps a bushel at a time&mdash;but these are to be
found solely at the street-markets.</p>

<p>The ordinary street apparatus for roasting
chestnuts is simple. A round pan, with a few
holes punched in it, costing 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> in a
marine-store shop, has burning charcoal within
it, and is surmounted by a second pan, or kind
of lid, containing chestnuts, which are thus kept
hot. During my inquiry, chestnuts were dear.
“People don’t care,” I was told, “whether
chestnuts is three and six, as they are now, or
one and six a peck, as I hope they will be
afore long; they wants the same pennyworths.”</p>

<p>Chestnuts are generally bought wholesale in
Duke’s-place, on the Sunday mornings, for
street sale; but some street-dealers buy them of
those costermongers, whose means enable them
“to lay in” a quantity. The retail customers
are, for the most part, boys and girls, or a few
labourers or street people. The usual price is
sixteen a penny.</p>

<p>Roasted apples used to be vended in the
streets, and often along with roasted chestnuts,
but it is a trade which has now almost entirely
disappeared, and its disappearance is attributed
to the prevalence of potato cans.</p>

<p>I had the following account from a woman,
apparently between sixty and seventy, though
she said she was only about fifty. What she
was in her youth, she said, she neither knew
nor cared. At any rate she was unwilling to
converse about it. I found her statement as to
chestnuts <span class="lock">corroborated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The trade’s nothing to what it was, sir,” she
said. “Why when the hackney coaches was in
the streets, I’ve often sold 2<i>s.</i> worth of a night
at a time, for a relish, to the hackneymen that
was waiting their turn over their beer. Six and
eight a penny was enough then; now people
must have sixteen; though I pays 3<i>s.</i> a peck,
and to get them at that’s a favour. I could
make my good 12<i>s.</i> a week on roasted chestnuts
and apples, and as much on other things in
them days, but I’m half-starved now. There’ll
never be such times again. People didn’t want
to cut one another’s throats in the street business
then. O, I don’t know anything about how
long ago, or what year&mdash;years is nothing to me&mdash;but
I only know that it was so. I got a
penny a piece then for my roasted apples, and
a halfpenny for sugar to them. I <i>could</i> live
then. Roasted apples was reckoned good for
the tooth-ache in them days, but, people
change so, they aren’t now. I don’t know
what I make now in chestnuts and apples,
which is all I sells&mdash;perhaps 5<i>s.</i> a week. My
rent’s 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a week. I lives on a bit of fish,
or whatever I can get, and that’s all about it.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Dry” Fruit Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The sellers of “dry fruit” cannot be described
as a class, for, with the exception of one old
couple, none that I know of confine themselves
to its sale, but resort to it merely when the
season prevents their dealing in “green fruit”
or vegetables. I have already specified what in
commerce is distinguished as “dry fruit,” but
its classification among the costers is somewhat
narrowed.</p>

<p>The dry-fruit sellers derive their supplies
partly from Duke’s-place, partly from Pudding-lane,
but perhaps principally from the costers
concerning whom I have spoken, who buy wholesale
at the markets and elsewhere, and who will
“clear out a grocer,” or buy such figs, &amp;c. as a
leading tradesman will not allow to be sent, or
offered, to his regular customers, although, perhaps,
some of the articles are tolerably good. Or
else the dry-fruit men buy a damaged lot of a
broker or grocer, and pick out all that is eatable,
or rather saleable.</p>

<p>The sale of dry fruit is unpopular among the
costermongers. Despite their utmost pains, they
cannot give to figs, or raisins, or currants, which
may be old and stale, anything of the bloom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
plumpness of good fruit, and the price of good
fruit is too high for them. Moreover, if the
fruit be a “damaged lot,” it is almost always
discoloured, and the blemish cannot be removed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give the average price of
dry fruit to the costermonger. The quality
and the “harvest” affect the price materially
in the regular trade.</p>

<p>The rule which I am informed the costermonger,
who sometimes “works” a barrow of
dried fruit, observes, is this: he will aim at cent.
per cent., and, to accomplish it, “slang” weights
are not unfrequently used. The stale fruit is
sold by the grocers, and the damaged fruit by
the warehouses to the costers, at from a half, but
much more frequently a fourth to a twentieth of
its prime cost. The principal street-purchasers
are boys.</p>

<p>A dry-fruit seller gave me the following
account:&mdash;By “half profits” he meant cent. per
cent., or, in other words, that the money he received
for his stock was half of it cost price and
half profit.</p>

<p>“I sell dry fruit, sir, in February and
March, because I must be doing something,
and green fruit’s not my money then. It’s
a poor trade. I’ve sold figs at 1<i>d.</i> a pound,&mdash;no,
sir, not slang the time I mean&mdash;and I
could hardly make 1<i>s.</i> a day at it, though
it was half profits. Our customers look at
them quite particler. ‘Let’s see the other
side of them figs,’ the boys’ll say, and then
they’ll out with&mdash;‘I say, master, d’you see any
green about me?’ Dates I can hardly get off
at all, no!&mdash;not if they was as cheap as potatoes,
or cheaper. I’ve been asked by women if dates
was good in dumplings? I’ve sometimes said
‘yes,’ though I knew nothing at all about them.
They’re foreign. I can’t say where they’re
grown. Almonds and raisins goes off best with
us. I don’t sell them by weight, but makes
them up in ha’penny or penny lots. There’s
two things, you see, and one helps off the other.
Raisins is dry grapes, I’ve heard. I’ve sold
grapes before they was dried, at 1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> the
pound. I didn’t do no good in any of ’em;
1<i>s.</i> a day on ’em was the topper, for all the half
profits. I’ll not touch ’em again if I aint
forced.”</p>

<p>There are a few costers who sell tolerable
dry fruit, but not to any extent.</p>

<p>The old couple I have alluded to stand all
the year round at the corner of a street running
into a great city thoroughfare. They are supplied
with their fruit, I am told, through the
friendliness of a grocer who charges no profit,
and sometimes makes a sacrifice for their benefit.
As I was told that this old couple would not
like inquiries to be made of them, I at once
desisted.</p>

<p>There are sometimes twenty costermongers
selling nothing but dry fruit, but more frequently
only ten, and sometimes only five;
while, perhaps, from 300 to 400 sell a few
figs, &amp;c., with other things, such as late apples,
the dry fruit being then used “just as a fill
up.”</p>

<p>According to the returns before given, the
gross quantity of dry fruit disposed of yearly in
the streets of London may be stated as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Vegetables.</span></h3>

<p>The seller of fruit in the streets confines his
traffic far more closely to fruit, than does the
vegetable-dealer to vegetables. Within these
three or four years many street-traders sell only
fruit the year through; but the purveyor of
vegetables now usually sells fish with his cabbages,
turnips, cauliflowers, or other garden
stuff. The fish that he carries out on his round
generally consists of soles, mackerel, or fresh
or salt herrings. This combination of the street-green-grocer
and street-fishmonger is called a
“general dealer.”</p>

<p>The general dealers are usually accompanied
by boys (as I have elsewhere shown), and sometimes
by their wives. If a woman be a general
dealer, she is mostly to be found at a stall or
standing, and not “going a round.”</p>

<p>The general dealer “works” everything
through the season. He generally begins the
year with sprats or plaice: then he deals in
soles until the month of May. After this he
takes to mackerel, haddocks, or red herrings.
Next he trades in strawberries or raspberries.
From these he will turn to green and ripe gooseberries;
thence he will go to cherries; from
cherries he will change to red or white currants;
from them to plums or green-gages, and
from them again to apples and pears, and damsons.
After these he mostly “works” a few
vegetables, and continues with them until the
fish season begins again. Some general dealers
occasionally trade in sweetmeats, but this is not
usual, and is looked down upon by the “trade.”</p>

<p>“I am a general dealer,” said one of the
better class; “my missis is in the same line as
myself, and sells everything that I do (barring
green stuff.) She follows me always in what
I sell. She has a stall, and sits at the corner of
the street. I have got three children. The
eldest is ten, and goes out with me to call my
goods for me. I have had inflammation in the
lungs, and when I call my goods for a little
while my voice leaves me. My missis is lame.
She fell down a cellar, when a child, and injured
her hip. Last October twelvemonth I was laid
up with cold, which settled on my lungs, and
laid me in my bed for a month. My missis kept
me all that time. She was ‘working’ fresh
herrings; and if it hadn’t been for her we must
all have gone into the workhouse. We are doing
very badly now. I have no work to do. I have
no stock-money to work with, and I object to
pay 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for the loan of 10<i>s.</i> Once
I gave a man 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for ten months for
the loan of 10<i>s.</i>, and that nearly did me up. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have had 8<i>s.</i> of the same party since, and paid
1<i>s.</i> a week for eight weeks for the loan of it.
I consider it most extortionate to have to pay
2<i>d.</i> a day for the loan of 8<i>s.</i>, and won’t do it.
When the season gets a bit better I shall borrow
a shilling of one friend and a shilling of another,
and then muddle on with as much stock-money
as I can scrape together. My missis is at home
now doing nothing. Last week it’s impossible
to say what she took, for we’re obliged to buy
victuals and firing with it as we take it. She
can’t go out charing on account of her hip.
When she is out, and I am out, the children
play about in the streets. Only last Saturday
week she was obligated to take the shoes off her
feet to get the children some victuals. We owe
two weeks’ rent, and the landlord, though I’ve
lived in the house five years, is as sharp as if
I was a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said another vegetable-dealer, who
was a robust-looking young man, very clean in his
person, and dressed in costermonger corduroy,
“I can hardly say what my business is worth to
me, for I’m no scholard. I was brought up to
the business by my mother. I’ve a middling
connection, and perhaps clear 3<i>s.</i> a day, every
fine day, or 15<i>s.</i> or 16<i>s.</i> a week; but out of that
there’s my donkey to keep, which I suppose costs
6<i>d.</i> a day, that’s seven sixpences off. Wet or
fine, she must be fed, in coorse. So must I;
but I’ve only myself to keep at present, and I
hire a lad when I want one. I work my own
trap. Then things is so uncertain. Why, now,
look here, sir. Last Friday, I think it was&mdash;but
that don’t matter, for it often happens&mdash;fresh
herrings was 4<i>s.</i> the 500 in the morning, and
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at night, so many had come in. I buy
at Billingsgate-market, and sometimes of a
large shopkeeper, and at Covent-garden and the
Borough. If I lay out 7<i>s.</i> in a nice lot of cabbages,
I may sell them for 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or if it isn’t
a lucky day with me for 8<i>s.</i>, or less. Sometimes
people won’t buy, as if the cholera was in the
cabbages. Then turnips isn’t such good sale yet,
but they may be soon, for winter’s best for them.
There’s more bilings then than there’s roastings,
I think. People like broth in cold weather. I
buy turnips by the ‘tally.’ A tally’s five dozen
bunches. There’s no confinement of the number
to a bunch; it’s by their size; I’ve known
twelve, and I’ve known twice that. I sell three
parts of the turnips at 1<i>d.</i> a bunch, and the other
part at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> If I get them at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the tally I
do well on turnips. I go the same rounds pretty
regularly every day, or almost every day. I don’t
object to wet weather so much, because women
don’t like to stir out then, and so they’ll buy of
me as I pass. Carrots I do little in; they’re dear,
but they’ll be cheaper in a month or two. They
always are. I don’t work on Sundays. If I
did, I’d get a jacketing. Our chaps would say:
‘Well, you <i>are</i> a scurf. <i>You</i> have a round; give
another man a Sunday chance.’ A gentleman
once said to me, when I was obligated to work on
a Sunday: ‘Why don’t you leave it off, when
you know it ain’t right?’ ‘Well, sir,’ said I,
and he spoke very kind to me, ‘well, sir, I’m
working for my dinner, and if you’ll give me 4<i>s.</i>
or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, I’ll tumble to your notion and drop it,
and I’ll give you these here cowcumbers,’ (I was
working cowcumbers at that time) ‘to do what
you like with, and they cost me half-a-crown.’
In potatoes I don’t do a great deal, and it’s no
great trade. If I did, I should buy at the
warehouses in Tooley-street, where they are
sold in sacks of 1 cwt.; 150 lbs. and 200 lbs.,
at 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> the cwt. I sell mine, tidy
good, at 3 pound 2<i>d.</i>, and a halfpenny a pound,
but as I don’t do much, not a bushel a day, I buy
at market by the bushel at from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> I
never uses slangs. I sold three times as many
potatoes as I do now four years back. I don’t
know why, ’cept it be that the rot set people again
them, and their taste’s gone another way. I sell
a few more greens than I did, but not many.
Spinach I don’t do only a little in it. Celery
I’m seldom able to get rid on. It’s more women’s
work. Ing-uns the same.”</p>

<p>I may add that I found the class, who confined
their business principally to the sale of
vegetables, the dullest of all the costermongers.
Any man may labour to make 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> of cabbages
or turnips, which cost him 1<i>s.</i>, when the
calculation as to the relative proportion of measures,
&amp;c. is beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>Pursuing the same mode of calculation as has
been heretofore adopted, we find that the absolute
quantity of vegetables sold in the London
streets by the costers is as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Aristocratic” Vegetable-Sale.</span></h3>

<p>In designating these dealers I use a word not
uncommon among the costermongers. These
aristocratic sellers, who are not one in twenty,
or perhaps in twenty-five, of the whole body of
costermongers, are generally men of superior
manners and better dressed than their brethren.
The following narrative, given to me by one of
the body, shows the nature of the <span class="lock">trade:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It depends a good deal upon the season and
the price, as to what I begin with in the ‘haristocratic’
way. My rounds are always in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
suburbs. I sell neither in the streets, nor squares
in town. I like it best where there are detached
villas, and best of all where there are kept mistresses.
They are the best of all customers to men
like me. We talk our customers over among
ourselves, and generally know who’s who. One
way by which we know the kept ladies is, they
never sell cast-off clothes, as some ladies do, for
new potatoes or early peas. Now, my worst
customers, as to price, are the ladies&mdash;or gentlemen&mdash;they’re
both of a kidney&mdash;what keeps
fashionable schools. <i>They</i> are the people to
drive a bargain, but then they buy largely.
Some buy entirely of costermongers. There’s
one gent. of a school-keeper buys so much and
knows so well what o’clock it is, that I’m satisfied
he saves many a pound a year by buying of
us ’stead of the greengrocers.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I begin the season in the haristocratic
way, with early lettuces for salads. I
carry my goods in handsome baskets, and sometimes
with a boy, or a boy and a girl, to help
me. I buy my lettuces by the score (of heads)
when first in, at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and sell them at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>
each, which is 1<i>s.</i> profit on a score. I have sold
twenty, and I once sold thirty score, that way
in a day. The profit on the thirty was 2<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>,
but out of that I had to pay three boys, for I
took three with me, and our expenses was 7<i>s.</i>
But you must consider, sir, that this is a precarious
trade. Such goods are delicate, and
spoil if they don’t go off. I give credit sometimes,
if anybody I know says he has no change.
I never lost nothing.</p>

<p>“Then there’s grass (asparagus), and that’s
often good money. I buy all mine at Covent-garden,
where it’s sold in bundles, according to
the earliness of the season, at from 5<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>,
containing from six to ten dozen squibs (heads).
These you have to take home, untie, cut off the
scraggy ends, trim, and scrape, and make them
level. Children help me to do this in the court
where I live. I give them a few ha’pence,
though they’re eager enough to do it for nothing
but the fun. I’ve had 10<i>s.</i> worth made ready
in half an hour.</p>

<p>“Well, now, sir, about grass, there’s not a
coster in London, I’m sure, ever tasted it; and
how it’s eaten puzzles us.” [I explained the
manner in which asparagus was brought to
table.] “That’s the ticket, is it, sir? Well, I
was once at the Surrey, and there was some
macaroni eaten on the stage, and I thought
grass was eaten in the same way, perhaps;
swallowed like one o’clock,” [rather a favourite
comparison among the costers.]</p>

<p>“I have the grass&mdash;it’s always called, when
cried in the streets, ‘Spar-row gra-ass’&mdash;tied up
in bundles of a dozen, twelve to a dozen, or one
over, and for these I never expect less than 6<i>d.</i>
For a three or four dozen lot, in a neat sieve, I
ask 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and never take less than 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> I
once walked thirty-five miles with grass, and
have oft enough been thirty miles. I made 7<i>s.</i>
or 8<i>s.</i> a day by it, and next day or two perhaps
nothing, or may-be had but one customer. I’ve
sold half-crown lots, on a Saturday night, for a
sixpence; and it <i>was</i> sold some time back at
2<i>d.</i> a bundle, in the New Cut, to poor people.
I dare say some as bought it had been maid-servants
and understood it. I’ve raffled 5<i>s.</i>
worth of grass in the parlour of a respectable
country inn of an evening.</p>

<p>“The costers generally buy new potatoes at
4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> the bushel, and cry them at ‘three-pound-tuppence;’
but I’ve given 7<i>s.</i> a bushel,
for choice and early, and sold them at 2<i>d.</i> a
pound. It’s no great trade, for the bushel may
weigh only 50 lb., and at 2<i>d.</i> a pound that’s
only 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The schools don’t buy at all until
they’re 1<i>d.</i> the pound, and don’t buy in any
quantity until they’re 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the 25 lb. One
day a school ’stonished me by giving me 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for 25 lb., which is the general weight of the
half bushel. Perhaps the master had taken a
drop of something short that morning. The
schools are dreadful screws, to be sure.</p>

<p>“Green peas, early ones, I don’t buy when
they first come in, for then they’re very dear, but
when they’re 4<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bushel, and that’s
pretty soon. I can make five pecks of a bushel.
Schools don’t touch peas ’till they’re 2<i>s.</i> a bushel.</p>

<p>“Cowcumbers were an aristocratic sale. Four
or five years ago they were looked upon, when
first in, and with a beautiful bloom upon them,
as the finest possible relish. But the cholera
came in 1849, and everybody&mdash;’specially the
women&mdash;thought the cholera was in cowcumbers,
and I’ve known cases, foreign and English, sent
from the Borough Market for manure.</p>

<p>“I sell a good many mushrooms. I sometimes
can pick up a cheap lot at Covent Garden.
I make them up in neat sieves of three dozen to
eight dozen according to size, and I have sold
them at 4<i>s.</i> the sieve, and made half that on
each sieve I sold. They are down to 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> a sieve very soon.</p>

<p>“Green walnuts for pickling I sell a quantity
of. One day I sold 20<i>s.</i> worth&mdash;half profit&mdash;I
got them so cheap, but that was an exception.
I sold them cheap too. One lady has bought a
bushel and a half at a time. For walnut
catsup the refuse of the walnut is used; it’s
picked up in the court, where I’ve got children
or poor fellows for a few ha’pence or a pint of
beer to help me to peel the walnuts.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Onion Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of onions in the streets is immense.
They are now sold at the markets at an average
of 2<i>s.</i> a bushel. Two years ago they were 1s.,
and they have been 4<i>s.</i> and up to 7<i>s.</i> the bushel.
They are now twisted into “ropes” for street sale.
The ropes are of straw, into which the roots are
platted, and secured firmly enough, so that the
ropes can be hung up; these have superseded
the netted onions, formerly sold by the Jew boys.
The plaiting, or twisting, is done rapidly by the
women, and a straw-bonnet-maker described it
to me as somewhat after the mode of her trade,
only that the top, or projecting portion of the
stem of the onion, was twisted within the straw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
instead of its being plaited close and flat together.
The trade in rope onions is almost entirely
in the hands of the Irish women and girls.
There are now, it is said, from 800 to 1000 persons
engaged in it. Onion selling can be started
on a small amount of capital, from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>,
which is no doubt one inducement for those poor
persons to resort to it. The sixpenny ropes,
bunches, or strings (I heard each word applied),
contain from three to four dozen; the penny
bunches, from six to twenty roots, according to
size; and the intermediate and higher priced
bunches in proportion. Before Christmas, a good
many shilling lots are sold. Among the costermongers
I heard this useful root&mdash;which the
learned in such matters have pronounced to be,
along with the mushroom, the foundation of every
sauce, ancient or modern&mdash;called ing-guns, ing-ans,
injens, injyens, inions, innons, almost everything
but onions.</p>

<p>An Irishwoman, apparently of thirty-five, but
in all probability younger&mdash;she did not know
her age&mdash;gave me the following account. Her
face, with its strongly-marked Irish features, was
almost purpled from constant exposure to the
weather. She was a teetotaller. She was communicative
and garrulous, even beyond the
average of her countrywomen. She was decently
clad, had been in London fifteen years (she
thought) having been brought from Ireland, <i>viâ</i>
Bristol, by her parents (both dead). She herself
was a widow, her husband, “a bricklayer” she
called him (probably a bricklayer’s labourer),
having died of the cholera in 1849. I take up
her statement from that period:</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, sir, he died&mdash;the heavins be his
bed!&mdash;and he was prepared by Father M&mdash;&mdash;.
We had our thrials togither, but sore’s been the
cross and heavy the burthin since it plased God
to call him. Thin, there’s the two childer,
Biddy and Ned. They’ll be tin and they’ll be
eight come their next burreth-days, ’plase the
Lorrud. They can hilp me now, they can. They
sells ing-uns as well. I ropes ’em for ’em. How
is ing-uns roped? Shure, thin&mdash;but it’s not
mocking me your ’onnur is&mdash;shure, thin, a gintleman
like you, that can write like a horrus a-galloping,
and perhaps is as larned as a praste,
glory be to God! <i>must</i> know how to rope ing-uns!
Poor people can do it. Some say it’s a sacrit,
but that’s all a say, or there couldn’t be so many
ropes a-silling. I buy the sthraw at a sthraw-daler’s;
twopinn’orth at a time; that’ll make
six or twilve ropes, according to what they are,
sixpinny or what. It’s as sthraight as it can be
grown, the sthraw, that it is indeed. Och, sir,
we’ve had many’s the black day, me and the
childer, poor things; it’s thim I care about, but&mdash;God’s
name be praised!&mdash;we’ve got on somehow.
Another poor woman&mdash;she’s a widdur too,
hilp her!&mdash;and me has a 2<i>s.</i> room for the two of
us. We’ve our siprate furnithur. She has only
hersilf, but is fond of the childer, as you or your
lady&mdash;bliss her! if you’ve got one&mdash;might be, if
you was with them. I can read a little mysilf,
at laste I could oncte, and I gits them a bit o’
schoolin’ now and thin, whin I can, of an evenin’
mostly. I can’t write a letther; I wish I could.
Shure, thin, sir, I’ll tell you the thruth&mdash;we does
best on ing-uns. Oranges is nixt, and nuts isn’t
near so good. The three of us now makes 1<i>s.</i>
and sometimes 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, and that’s grand
doin’s. We may sill bechuxt us from two to
three dozin ropes a day. I’m quick at roping
the ing-uns. I never noted how many ropes an
hour. I buy them of a thradesman, an honist
gintleman, I know, and I see him at mass ivery
Sunday, and he gives me as many as he can for
1<i>s.</i> or what it is. We has 1<i>d.</i>, plase God, on ivery
6<i>d.</i>; yis, sir, perhaps more sometimes. I’ll not
tell your ’onnur a bit of a lie. And so we now
get a nice bit o’ fish, with a bit of liver on a
Sunday. I sell to the thradesmen, and the lodgers
of them, about here (Tottenham-court-road), and
in many other parruts, for we thravels a dale.
The childer always goes the same round. We
follows one another. I’ve sould in the sthreets
ever since I’ve been in this counthry.”</p>

<p>The greatest sum of money expended by the
poor upon any vegetable (after potatoes) is spent
upon onions&mdash;99,900<i>l.</i> being annually devoted
to the purchase of that article. To those who
know the habits of the poor, this will appear in
no way singular&mdash;a piece of bread and an onion
being to the English labourer what bread and
an apple or a bunch of grapes is to the French
peasant&mdash;often his dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Pot-Herbs and Celery.</span></h3>

<p>I use the old phrase, <i>pot-herbs</i>, for such productions
as sage, thyme, mint, parsley, sweet
marjoram, fennel, (though the last is rarely sold
by the street-people), &amp;c.; but “herbs” is the
usual term. More herbs, such as agrimony,
balm (balsam), wormwood, tansy, &amp;c., used to
be sold in the streets. These were often used for
“teas,” medicinally perhaps, except tansy, which,
being a strong aromatic, was used to flavour
puddings. Wormwood, too, was often bought to
throw amongst woollen fabrics, as a protective
against the attack of moths.</p>

<p>The street herb-trade is now almost entirely
in the hands of Irishwomen, and is generally
carried on during the autumn and winter at
stalls. With it, is most commonly united the
sale of celery. The herbs are sold at the several
markets, usually in shilling lots, but a quarter
of a shilling lot may be purchased. The Irishwoman
pursues a simple method of business.
What has cost her 1<i>s.</i> she divides into 24 lots,
each of 1<i>d.</i>, or she will sell half of a lot for a
halfpenny. An Irishwoman said to me:</p>

<p>“Thrade isn’t good, sir; it falls and it falls.
I don’t sell so many herrubs or so much ciliry
as I did whin mate was higher. Poor people thin,
I’ve often been said it, used to buy bones and
bile them for broth with ciliry and the beautiful
herrubs. Now they buys a bit of mate and ates
it without brothing. It’s good one way and it’s
bad another. Only last Sathurday night my husband&mdash;and
a good husband he’s to me, though
he is a London man, for he knows how to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a bargain&mdash;he bought a bit of mutton, afore the
stroke of twilve, in Newgit-markit, at 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>
the pound. I don’t know what parrut it was. I
don’t understand that, but he does, and tills me
how to cook it. He has worruk at the docks, but
not very rigular. I think I sill most parrusley.
Whin frish herrings is chape, some biles them
with parrusley, and some fries them with ing-uns.
No, sir; I don’t make sixpence a day; not half-a-crown
a week, I’m shure. Whin herrubs isn’t
in&mdash;and they’re autumn and winther things, and
so is ciliry&mdash;I sills anything; gooseberries and
currints, or anything. If I’d had a family, I
couldn’t have had a shoe to my futt.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gross Value of the Fruit and Vegetables
Sold Annually in the London
Streets.</span></h3>

<p>To complete the present account of the costermonger’s
trade, we must now estimate the money
value of the fruit and vegetables disposed of by
them throughout the year. The money annually
spent in fish by the humbler portion of the metropolitan
population comes to, as we have seen,
very nearly one million five hundred thousand
pounds sterling&mdash;the sum laid out in fruit and
vegetables we shall find is but little more than a
third of this amount.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Number of Street Stalls.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Thus far we have dealt only with the itinerant
dealers in fish, fruit, or vegetables; but there are
still a large class of street-sellers, who obtain a
living by the sale of the same articles at some
fixed locality in the public thoroughfares; and
as these differ from the others in certain points,
they demand a short special notice here. First,
as to the number of stalls in the streets of London,
I caused personal observations to be
made; and in a walk of 46 miles, 632 stalls
were counted, which is at the rate of very
nearly 14 to the mile. This, too, was in bad
weather,&mdash;was not on a Saturday night,&mdash;and
at a season when the fruit-sellers all declare
that “things is dull.” The routes taken in
this inquiry were:&mdash;No. 1, from Vauxhall
to Hatton-garden; No. 2, from Baker-street
to Bermondsey; No. 3, from Blackwall to
Brompton; No. 4, from the Hackney-road
to the Edgeware-road. I give the results.</p>

<p>F. denotes fish-stalls; Fr. fruit-stalls; V.
vegetable-stalls; M. miscellaneous; and T.
presents the total.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous stalls include peas-soup,
pickled whelks, sweetmeats, toys, tin-ware,
elder-wine, and jewellery stands. Of these, the
toy-stalls were found to be the most numerous;
sweetmeats the next; tin-ware the next; while
the elder-wine stalls were least numerous.</p>

<p>Some of the results indicate, curiously enough,
the character of the locality. Thus, in Fleet-street
there were 3, in the Haymarket 5, in
Regent-street 6, and in Piccadilly 14 fruit-stalls,
and no fish-stalls&mdash;these streets not
being resorted to by the poor, to whom fruit
is a luxury, but fish a necessity. In the
Strand were 17 fruit and 2 fish-stalls; and in
Drury-lane were 8 stalls of fish to 6 of fruit.
On the other hand, there were in Ratcliffe-highway,
38 fish and 23 fruit-stalls; in Rosemary-lane,
13 fish and 8 fruit-stalls; in Shoreditch,
28 fish and 13 fruit-stalls; and in Bethnal-green
Road (the poorest district of all), 14 of
the fish, and but 3 of the fruit stalls. In some
places, the numbers were equal, or nearly so;
as in the Minories, for instance, the City-road,
the New-road, Goodge-street, Tottenham-court
Road, and the Camberwell-road; while in
Smithfield were 5, and in Cow-cross 2 fish-stalls,
and no fruit-stalls at all. In this enumeration
the street-markets of Leather-lane,
the New Cut, the Brill, &amp;c., are not included.</p>

<p>The result of this survey of the principal
London thoroughfares is that in the <i>mid-route</i>
(viz., from Brompton, along Piccadilly, the
Strand, Fleet-street, and so <i>viâ</i> the Commercial-road
to Blackwall), there are twice as many
stalls as in the great <i>northern thoroughfare</i> (that
is to say, from the Edgeware-road, along the
New-road, to the Hackney-road); the latter
route, however, has more than one-third as many
stalls as route No. 2, and that again more than
double the number of route No. 1. Hence it
appears that the more frequented the thoroughfare,
the greater the quantity of street-stalls.</p>

<p>The number of miles of streets contained
within the inner police district of the metropolis,
are estimated by the authorities at 2,000 (including
the city), and assuming that there are on
an average only four stalls to the mile throughout
London, we have thus a grand total of 8,000 fish,
fruit, vegetable, and other stalls dispersed
throughout the capital.</p>

<p>Concerning the character of the stalls at the
street-markets, the following observations have
been made:&mdash;At the New-cut there were, before
the removals, between the hours of eight
and ten on a Saturday evening, ranged along
the kerb-stone on the north side of the road,
beginning at Broad-wall to Marsh-gate (a distance
of nearly half-a-mile), a dense line of
“pitches”&mdash;at 77 of which were vegetables for
sale, at 40 fruit, 25 fish, 22 boots and shoes, 14
eatables, consisting of cakes and pies, hot eels,
baked potatoes, and boiled whelks; 10 dealt in
nightcaps, lace, ladies’ collars, artificial flowers,
silk and straw bonnets; 10 in tinware&mdash;such as
saucepans, tea-kettles, and Dutch-ovens; 9 in
crockery and glass, 7 in brooms and brushes, 5
in poultry and rabbits, 6 in paper, books, songs,
and almanacs; and about 60 in sundries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Character of the Street-Stalls.</span></h3>

<p>The stalls occupied by costermongers for the
sale of fish, fruit, vegetables, &amp;c., are chiefly
constructed of a double cross-trestle or moveable
frame, or else of two trestles, each with three
legs, upon which is laid a long deal board, or tray.
Some of the stalls consist merely of a few boards
resting upon two baskets, or upon two herring-barrels.
The fish-stalls are mostly covered with
paper&mdash;generally old newspapers or periodicals&mdash;but
some of the street-fishmongers, instead of
using paper to display their fish upon, have introduced
a thin marble slab, which gives the stall
a cleaner, and, what they consider a high attribute,
a “respectable” appearance.</p>

<p>Most of the fruit-stalls are, in the winter
time, fitted up with an apparatus for roasting
apples and chestnuts; this generally consists of
an old saucepan with a fire inside; and the
woman who vends them, huddled up in her old
faded shawl or cloak, often presents a picturesque
appearance, in the early evening, or in a fog,
with the gleam of the fire lighting up her half
somnolent figure. Within the last two or three
years, however, there has been so large a business
carried on in roasted chestnuts, that it has
become a distinct street-trade, and the vendors
have provided themselves with an iron apparatus,
large enough to roast nearly half a bushel at a
time. At the present time, however, the larger
apparatus is less common in the streets, and
more frequent in the shops, than in the previous
winter.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, peculiar kinds of stalls&mdash;such
as the hot eels and hot peas-soup stalls,
having tin oval pots, with a small chafing-dish
containing a charcoal fire underneath each, to
keep the eels or soup hot. The early breakfast
stall has two capacious tin cans filled with tea or
coffee, kept hot by the means before described,
and some are lighted up by two or three large
oil-lamps; the majority of these stalls, in the
winter time, are sheltered from the wind by a
screen made out of an old clothes horse covered
with tarpaulin. The cough-drop stand, with its
distilling apparatus, the tin worm curling nearly
the whole length of the tray, has but lately been
introduced. The nut-stall is fitted up with a
target at the back of it. The ginger-beer stand
may be seen in almost every street, with its
French-polished mahogany frame and bright
polished taps, and its foot-bath-shaped reservoir
of water, to cleanse the glasses. The hot elder
wine stand, with its bright brass urns, is equally
popular.</p>

<p>The sellers of plum-pudding, “cake, a penny
a slice,” sweetmeats, cough-drops, pin-cushions,
jewellery, chimney ornaments, tea and table-spoons,
make use of a table covered over, some
with old newspapers, or a piece of oil-cloth,
upon which are exposed their articles for sale.</p>

<p>Such is the usual character of the street-stalls.
There are, however, “stands” or “cans”
peculiar to certain branches of the street-trade.
The most important of these, such as the baked-potato
can, and the meat-pie stand, I have
before described, p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>.</p>

<p>The other means adopted by the street-sellers
for the exhibition of their various goods at
certain “pitches” or fixed localities are as
follows. Straw bonnets, boys’ caps, women’s
caps, and prints, are generally arranged for sale
in large umbrellas, placed “upside down.”
Haberdashery, with rolls of ribbons, edgings,
and lace, some street-sellers display on a stall;
whilst others have a board at the edge of the
pavement, and expose their wares upon it as
tastefully as they can. Old shoes, patched up
and well blacked, ready for the purchaser’s feet,
and tin ware, are often ranged upon the ground, or,
where the stock is small, a stall or table is used.</p>

<p>Many stationary street-sellers use merely
baskets, or trays, either supported in their hand,
or on their arm, or else they are strapped round
their loins, or suspended round their necks.
These are mostly fruit-women, watercress, blacking,
congreves, sheep’s-trotters, and ham-sandwich sellers.</p>

<p>Many stationary street-sellers stand on or near
the bridges; others near the steam-packet wharfs
or the railway terminuses; a great number of
them take their pitch at the entrance to a court,
or at the corners of streets; and stall-keepers
with oysters stand opposite the doors of public-houses.</p>

<p>It is customary for a street-seller who wants
to “pitch” in a new locality to solicit the leave
of the housekeeper, opposite whose premises he
desires to place his stall. Such leave obtained,
no other course is necessary.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Fruit-stall Keepers.</span></h3>

<p>I had the following statement from a woman
who has “kept a stall” in Marylebone, at the
corner of a street, which she calls “my corner,”
for 38 years. I was referred to her as a curious
type of the class of stall-keepers, and on my
visit, found her daughter at the “pitch.” This
daughter had all the eloquence which is attractive
in a street-seller, and so, I found, had her
mother when she joined us. They are profuse
in blessings; and on a bystander observing,
when he heard the name of these street-sellers,
that a jockey of that name had won the Derby
lately, the daughter exclaimed, “To be sure he
did; he’s my own uncle’s relation, and what a
lot of money came into the family! Bless God
for all things, and bless every body! Walnuts,
sir, walnuts, a penny a dozen! Wouldn’t give
you a bad one for the world, which is a great
thing for a poor ’oman for to offer to do.” The
daughter was dressed in a drab great-coat, which
covered her whole person. When I saw the
mother, she carried a similar great-coat, as she
was on her way to the stall; and she used it as
ladies do their muffs, burying her hands in it.
The mother’s dark-coloured old clothes seemed,
to borrow a description from Sir Walter Scott,
flung on with a pitchfork. These two women
were at first very suspicious, and could not be
made to understand my object in questioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
them; but after a little while, the mother became
not only communicative, but garrulous,
conversing&mdash;with no small impatience at any
interruption&mdash;of the doings of the people in her
neighbourhood. I was accompanied by an intelligent
costermonger, who assured me of his
certitude that the old woman’s statement was
perfectly correct, and I found moreover from
other inquiries that it was so.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” she began, “what is it that you
want of me? Do I owe you anything? There’s
half-pay officers about here for no good; what is
it you want? Hold your tongue, you young fool,”
(to her daughter, who was beginning to speak;)
“what do you know about it?” [On my satisfying
her that I had no desire to injure her, she
continued to say after spitting, a common practice
with her class, on a piece of money, “for
luck,”] “Certainly, sir, that’s very proper and
good. Aye, I’ve seen the world&mdash;the town
world and the country. I don’t know where I
was born; never mind about that&mdash;it’s nothing
to nobody. I don’t know nothing about my
father and mother; but I know that afore I
was eleven I went through the country with
my missis. She was a smuggler. I didn’t
know then what smuggling was&mdash;bless you, sir,
I didn’t; I knew no more nor I know who
made that lamp-post. I didn’t know the
taste of the stuff we smuggled for two years&mdash;didn’t
know it from small beer; I’ve known
it well enough since, God knows. My missis
made a deal of money that time at Deptford
Dockyard. The men wasn’t paid and let
out till twelve of a night&mdash;I hardly mind what
night it was, days was so alike then&mdash;and they
was our customers till one, two, or three in
the morning&mdash;Sunday morning, for anything I
know. I don’t know what my missis gained;
something jolly, there’s not a fear of it. She
was kind enough to me. I don’t know how long
I was with missis. After that I was a hopping,
and made my 15<i>s.</i> regular at it, and a haymaking;
but I’ve had a pitch at my corner for thirty-eight
year&mdash;aye! turned thirty-eight. It’s no
use asking me what I made at first&mdash;I can’t tell;
but I’m sure I made more than twice as much
as my daughter and me makes now, the two of us.
I wish people that thinks we’re idle now were
with me for a day. I’d teach them. I don’t&mdash;that’s
the two of us don’t&mdash;make 15<i>s.</i> a week now,
nor the half of it, when all’s paid. D&mdash;d if I do.
The d&mdash;d boys take care of that.” [Here I
had a statement of the boys’ tradings, similar to
what I have given.] “There’s ‘Canterbury’ has
lots of boys, and they bother me. I can tell,
and always could, how it is with working men.
When mechanics is in good work, their children
has halfpennies to spend with me. If they’re
hard up, there’s no halfpennies. The pennies
go to a loaf or to buy a candle. I might have
saved money once, but had a misfortunate family.
My husband? O, never mind about him. D&mdash;n
him. I’ve been a widow many years. My son&mdash;it’s
nothing how many children I have&mdash;is
married; he had the care of an ingine. But
he lost it from ill health. It was in a feather-house,
and the flue got down his throat, and
coughed him; and so he went into the country,
108 miles off, to his wife’s mother. But his
wife’s mother got her living by wooding, and
other ways, and couldn’t help him or his wife;
so he left, and he’s with me now. He has a job
sometimes with a greengrocer, at 6<i>d.</i> a day and
a bit of grub; a little bit&mdash;very. I must shelter
him. I couldn’t turn him out. If a Turk I
knew was in distress, and I had only half a loaf,
I’d give him half of that, if he was ever such
a Turk&mdash;I would, sir! Out of 6<i>d.</i> a day, my son&mdash;poor
fellow, he’s only twenty-seven!&mdash;wants
a bit of ’baccy and a pint of beer. It ’ud be
unnatural to oppose that, wouldn’t it, sir? He
frets about his wife, that’s staying with her
mother, 108 miles off; and about his little girl;
but I tell him to wait, and he may have more
little girls. God knows, they come when they’re
not wanted a bit. I joke and say all my old
sweethearts is dying away. Old Jemmy went off
sudden. He lent me money sometimes, but
I always paid him. He had a public once, and
had some money when he died. I saw him the
day afore he died. He was in bed, but wasn’t
his own man quite; though he spoke sensible
enough to me. He said, said he, ‘Won’t you
have half a quartern of rum, as we’ve often had
it?’ ‘Certainly, Jemmy,’ says I, ‘I came for
that very thing.’ Poor fellow! his friends are
quarrelling now about what he left. It’s 56<i>l.</i>
they say, and they’ll go to law very likely, and
lose every thing. There’ll be no such quarrelling
when I die, unless it is for the pawn-tickets.
I get a meal now, and got a meal afore; but it
was a better meal then, sir. Then look at my
expenses. I was a customer once. I used to
buy, and plenty such did, blue cloth aprons,
opposite Drury-lane theatre: the very shop’s
there still, but I don’t know what it is now;
I can’t call to mind. I gave 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a yard,
from twenty to thirty years ago, for an apron,
and it took two yards, and I paid 4<i>d.</i> for making
it, and so an apron cost 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;that wasn’t
much thought of in those times. I used to be
different off then. I never go to church; I used
to go when I was a little child at Sevenoaks.
I suppose I was born somewhere thereabouts.
I’ve forgot what the inside of a church is like.
There’s no costermongers ever go to church,
except the rogues of them, that wants to appear
good. I buy my fruit at Covent-garden. Apples
is now 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bushel there. I may make twice
that in selling them; but a bushel may last me
two, three, or four days.”</p>

<p>As I have already, under the street-sale of
fish, given an account of the oyster stall-keeper,
as well as the stationary dealers in sprats, and the
principal varieties of wet fish, there is no necessity
for me to continue this part of my subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now, in a measure, finished with the
metropolitan costermongers. We have seen that
the street-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
constitute a large proportion of the London population;
the men, women, and children numbering
at the least 30,000, and taking as much
as 2,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum. We have seen, moreover,
that these are the principal purveyors of
food to the poor, and that consequently they
are as important a body of people as they are
numerous. Of all classes they <i>should</i> be the
most honest, since the poor, least of all, can
afford to be cheated; and yet it has been shown
that the consciences of the London costermongers,
generally speaking, are as little developed
as their intellects; indeed, the moral and religious
state of these men is a foul disgrace to us,
laughing to scorn our zeal for the “propagation
of the gospel in <i>foreign</i> parts,” and making our
many societies for the civilization of savages
on the other side of the globe appear like a
“delusion, a mockery, and a snare,” when we
have so many people sunk in the lowest depths
of barbarism round about our very homes. It
is well to have Bishops of New Zealand when
we have Christianized all <i>our own</i> heathen; but
with 30,000 individuals, in merely <i>one</i> of our
cities, utterly creedless, mindless, and principleless,
surely it would look more like earnestness
on our parts if we created Bishops of the New-Cut,
and sent “right reverend fathers” to watch
over the “cure of souls” in the Broadway and
the Brill. If our sense of duty will not rouse us
to do this, at least our regard for our own interests
should teach us, that it is not safe to allow
this vast dungheap of ignorance and vice to
seethe and fester, breeding a social pestilence in
the very heart of our land. That the costermongers
belong essentially to the dangerous
classes none can doubt; and those who know a
coster’s hatred of a “crusher,” will not hesitate
to believe that they are, as they themselves confess,
one and all ready, upon the least disturbance,
to seize and disable their policeman.</p>

<p>It would be a marvel indeed if it were otherwise.
Denied the right of getting a living by
the street authorities, after having, perhaps, been
supplied with the means of so doing by the
parish authorities&mdash;the stock which the one had
provided seized and confiscated by the other&mdash;law
seems to them a mere farce, or at best, but
the exercise of an arbitrary and despotic power,
against which they consider themselves justified,
whenever an opportunity presents itself, of
using the same physical force as it brings to
bear against them. That they are ignorant and
vicious as they are, surely is not their fault. If
we were all born with learning and virtue, then
might we, with some show of justice, blame the
costermongers for their want of both; but seeing
that even the most moral and intelligent of us
owe the greater part, if not the whole, of our
wisdom and goodness to the tuition of others,
we must not in the arrogance of our self-conceit
condemn these men because they are not like
ourselves, when it is evident that we should have
been as they are, had not some one done for us
what we refuse to do for them. We leave them
destitute of all perception of beauty, and therefore
without any means of pleasure but through
their appetites, and then we are surprized to
find their evenings are passed either in brutalizing
themselves with beer, or in gloating
over the mimic sensuality of the “penny gaff.”
Without the least intellectual culture is it likely,
moreover, that they should have that perception
of antecedents and consequents which enables us
to see in the shadows of the past the types of
the future&mdash;or that power of projecting the
mind into the space, as it were, of time, which
we in Saxon-English call fore-sight, and in
Anglo-Latin pro-vidence&mdash;a power so godlike
that the latter term is often used by us to express
the Godhead itself? Is it possible, then,
that men who are as much creatures of the
present as the beasts of the field&mdash;instinctless
animals&mdash;should have the least faculty of pre-vision?
or rather is it not natural that, following
the most precarious of all occupations&mdash;one in
which the subsistence depends upon the weather
of this the most variable climate of any&mdash;they
should fail to make the affluence of the fine
days mitigate the starvation of the rainy ones?
or that their appetites, made doubly eager by
the privations suffered in their adversity, should
be indulged in all kinds of excess in their
prosperity&mdash;their lives being thus, as it were,
a series of alternations between starvation and
surfeit?</p>

<p>The fate of children brought up amid the
influence of such scenes&mdash;with parents starving
one week and drunk all the next&mdash;turned loose
into the streets as soon as they are old enough
to run alone&mdash;sent out to sell in public-houses
almost before they know how to put two halfpence
together&mdash;their tastes trained to libidinism
long before puberty at the penny concert, and
their passions inflamed with the unrestrained
intercourse of the twopenny hops&mdash;the fate of
the young, I say, abandoned to the blight of such
associations as these, cannot well be otherwise
than it is. If the child be father to the man,
assuredly it does not require a great effort of
imagination to conceive the manhood that such
a childhood must necessarily engender.</p>

<p>Some months back Mr. Mayhew, with a view
to mitigate what appeared to him to be the
chief evils of a street-seller’s life, founded “The
Friendly Association of London Costermongers,”
the objects of which were as follows:</p>

<p>1. To establish a Benefit and Provident Fund
for insuring to each Member a small weekly
allowance in Sickness or Old Age, as well as
a certain sum to his family at his death, so
that the Costermongers, when incapacitated
from labour, may not be forced to seek parochial
relief, nor, at their decease, be left to be
buried by the parish.</p>

<p>2. To institute a Penny Savings’ Bank and
Winter Fund, where the smallest deposits will
be received and bear interest, so that the Costermongers
may be encouraged to lay by even
the most trivial sums, not only as a provision
for future comfort, but as the means of assisting
their poorer brethren with future loans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>3. To form a Small Loan Fund for supplying
the more needy Costermongers with Stock-Money,
&amp;c., at a fair and legitimate interest,
instead of the exorbitant rates that are now
charged.</p>

<p>4. To promote the use of full weights and
measures by every Member of the Association,
as well as a rigid inspection of the scales, &amp;c.,
of all other Costermongers, so that the honestly
disposed Street-sellers may be protected, and
the public secured against imposition.</p>

<p>5. To protect the Costermongers from interference
when lawfully pursuing their calling,
by placing it in their power to employ counsel
to defend them, if unjustly prosecuted.</p>

<p>6. To provide harmless, if not rational,
amusements at the same cheap rate as the
pernicious entertainments now resorted to by
the Street-sellers.</p>

<p>7. To adopt means for the gratuitous education
of the children of the Costermongers, in
the day time, and the men and women themselves
in the evening.</p>

<p>This institution remains at present comparatively
in abeyance, from the want of funds to
complete the preliminary arrangements. Those,
however, who may feel inclined to contribute
towards its establishment, will please to pay
their subscriptions into Messrs. Twinings’ Bank,
Strand, to the account of Thomas Hughes, Esq.
(of 63, Upper Berkeley-street, Portman-square),
who has kindly consented to act as Treasurer to
the Association.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Public Meeting of Street-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>The Association above described arose out of
a meeting of costermongers and other street-folk,
which was held, at my instance, on the
evening of the 12th of June last, in the National
Hall, Holborn. The meeting was announced as
one of “street-sellers, street-performers, and
street-labourers,” but the costermongers were
the great majority present. The admission was
by ticket, and the tickets, which were of course
gratuitous, were distributed by men familiar with
all the classes invited to attend. These men
found the tickets received by some of the street-people
with great distrust; others could not be
made to understand why any one should trouble
himself on their behoof; others again, cheerfully
promised their attendance. Some accused
the ticket distributors with having been bribed
by the Government or the police, though for
what purpose was not stated. Some abused them
heartily, and some offered to treat them. At
least 1,000 persons were present at the meeting,
of whom 731 presented their tickets; the others
were admitted, because they were known to the
door-keepers, and had either lost their tickets or
had not the opportunity to obtain them. The
persons to whom cards of admission were given
were invited to write their names and callings
on the backs, and the cards so received gave
the following result. Costermongers, 256; fish-sellers,
28; hucksters, 23; lot-sellers, 18; street-labourers,
16; paper-sellers and workers, 13;
toy-sellers, 11; ginger-beer-sellers, 9; hardware-sellers,
9; general-dealers, 7; street-musicians,
5; street-performers, 5; cakes and pastry-sellers,
fried-fish-vendors, and tinkers, each, 4; turf-vendors,
street-exhibitors, strolling-players, cat’s-meat-men,
water-cress-sellers, stay-lace, and
cotton-sellers, each, 3; board-carriers, fruit-sellers,
street-tradesmen, hawkers, street-greengrocers,
shell-fish-vendors, poulterers, mud-larks,
wire-workers, ballad-singers, crock-men,
and booksellers, each, 2; the cards also gave
one each of the following avocations:&mdash;fly-cage-makers,
fly-paper-sellers, grinders, tripe-sellers,
pattern-printers, blind-paper-cutters, lace-collar-sellers,
bird-sellers, bird-trainers, pen-sellers,
lucifer-merchants, watch-sellers, decorators, and
play-bill-sellers. 260 cards were given in
without being indorsed with any name or
calling.</p>

<p>My object in calling this meeting was to
ascertain from the men themselves what were the
grievances to which they considered themselves
subjected; what were the peculiarities and what
the privations of a street-life. Cat-calls, and
every description of discordant sound, prevailed,
before the commencement of the proceedings,
but there was also perfect good-humour. Although
it had been announced that all the
speakers were to address the meeting from the
platform, yet throughout the evening some man
or other would occasionally essay to speak from
the body of the hall. Some of those present
expressed misgivings that the meeting was got
up by the Government, or by Sir R. Peel, and
that policemen, in disguise, were in attendance.
The majority showed an ignorance of the usual
forms observed at public meetings, though some
manifested a thorough understanding of them.
Nor was there much delicacy observed&mdash;but,
perhaps, about as much as in some assemblages
of a different character&mdash;in clamouring
down any prosy speaker. Many present were
without coats (for it was a warm evening),
some were without waistcoats, many were in
tatters, hats and caps were in infinite varieties
of shape and shade, while a few were well and
even genteelly dressed. The well dressed street-sellers
were nearly all young men, and one of
these wore moustachios. After I had explained,
amidst frequent questions and interruptions, the
purpose for which I had summoned the meeting,
and had assured the assembly that, to the
best of my knowledge, no policemen were present,
I invited free discussion.</p>

<p>It was arranged that some one person should
address the meeting as the representative of
each particular occupation. An elderly man
of small stature and lively intelligent features,
stood up to speak on behalf of the “paper-workers,”
“flying-stationers,” and “standing-patterers.”
He said, that “for twenty-four years
he had been a penny-showman, a street-seller,
and a patterer.” He dwelt upon the difference
of a street-life when he was young and at
the present time, the difference being between
meals and no meals; and complained that though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
he had been well educated, had friends in a
respectable way of life, and had never been
accused of any dishonesty, such was the “moral
brand,” of having been connected with a street
life, that it was never got rid of. He more
than once alluded to this “moral brand.”
The question was, he concluded, in what way
were they to obtain an honest livelihood, so
as to keep their wives and children decently,
without being buffeted about like wild beasts
in the open streets? This address was characterised
by propriety in the delivery, and by the
absence of any grammatical inaccuracy, or vulgarity
of tone or expression.</p>

<p>A costermonger, a quiet-looking man, tidily
clad, said he was the son of a country auctioneer,
now dead; and not having been brought up
to any trade, he came to London to try his luck.
His means were done before he could obtain employment;
and he was in a state of starvation.
At last he was obliged to apply to the parish.
The guardians took him into the workhouse,
and offered to pass him home: but as he could
do no good there, he refused to go. Whereupon,
giving him a pound of bread, he was turned
into the streets, and had nowhere to lay his head.
In wandering down the New-cut a costermonger
questioned him, and then took him into his
house and fed him. This man kept him for a
year and a half; he showed him how to get a
living in the street trade; and when he left, gave
him 20<i>s.</i> to start with. With this sum he got
a good living directly; and he could do so now,
were it not for the police, whose conduct, he
stated, was sometimes very tyrannical. He had
been dragged to the station-house, for standing
to serve customers, though he obstructed nobody;
the policeman, however, called it an obstruction,
and he (the speaker) was fined 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; whereupon,
because he had not the half-crown, his
barrow and all it contained were taken from him,
and he had heard nothing of them since. This
almost broke him down. There was no redress
for these things, and he thought they ought to
be looked into.</p>

<p>This man spoke with considerable energy; and
when he had concluded, many costermongers
shouted, at the top of their voices, that they
could substantiate every word of what he had
said.</p>

<p>A young man, of superior appearance, said
he was the son of a gentleman who had held a
commission as Lieutenant in the 20th Foot, and
as Captain in the 34th Infantry, and afterwards
became Sub-director of the Bute Docks; in which
situation he died, leaving no property. He (the
speaker) was a classical scholar; but having no
trade, he was compelled, after his father’s death,
to come to London in search of employment,
thinking that his pen and his school acquirements
would secure it. But in this expectation
he was disappointed,&mdash;though for a short period
he was earning two guineas a week in copying
documents for the House of Commons. That
time was past; and he was a street-patterer
now through sheer necessity. He could say
from experience that the earnings of that class
were no more than from 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a week. He
then declaimed at some length against the interference
of the police with the patterers, considering
it harsh and unnecessary.</p>

<p>After some noisy and not very relevant discussion
concerning the true amount of a street-patterer’s
earnings, a clergyman of the Established
Church, now selling stenographic cards
in the street, addressed the meeting. He observed,
that in every promiscuous assembly
there would always be somebody who might be
called unfortunate. Of this number he was one;
for when, upon the 5th September, 1831, he
preached a funeral sermon before a fashionable
congregation, upon Mr. Huskisson’s death by a
railway accident, he little thought he should
ever be bound over in his own recognizances in
10<i>l.</i> for obstructing the metropolitan thoroughfares.
He was a native of Hackney, but in early
life he went to Scotland, and upon the 24th June,
1832, he obtained the presentation to a small
extra-parochial chapel in that country, upon the
presentation of the Rev. Dr. Bell. His people
embraced Irvingism, and he was obliged to
leave; and in January, 1837, he came to the
metropolis. His history since that period he
need not state. His occupation was well known,
and he could confirm what had been stated with
regard to the police. The Police Act provided,
that all persons selling goods in the streets were
to keep five feet off the pavement, the street not
being a market. He had always kept with his
wares and his cards beyond the prohibited distance
of five feet; and for six years and a half
he had sold his cards without molesting or being
molested. After some severe observations upon
the police, he narrated several events in his
personal history to account for his present condition,
which he attributed to misfortune and
the injustice of society. In the course of these
explanations he gave an illustration of his
classical acquirements, in having detected a
grammatical error in a Latin inscription upon
the plate of a foundation-stone for a new church
in Westminster. He wrote to the incumbent,
pointing out the error, and the incumbent asked
the beadle who he was. “Oh,” said the beadle,
“he is a fellow who gets his living in the
streets.” This was enough. He got no answer
to his letter, though he knew the incumbent and
his four curates, and had attended his church
for seven years. After dwelling on the sufferings
of those whose living was gained in the
streets, he said, that if persons wished really
to know anything of the character or habits of
life of the very poor, of whom he was one, the
knowledge could only be had from a personal
survey of their condition in their own homes.
He ended, by expressing his hope that by better
treatment, and an earnest attention&mdash;moral,
social, and religious&mdash;to their condition, the poor
of the streets might be gathered to the church,
and to God.</p>

length of the way in which he was treated by
the police.</p>

<p>A hale-looking man, a costermonger, of middle
age&mdash;who said he had a wife and four children
dependent upon him&mdash;then spoke. It was a
positive fact, he said, notwithstanding their
poverty, their hardships, and even their degradation
in the eyes of some, that the first markets
in London were mainly supported by
costermongers. What would the Duke of
Bedford’s market in Covent-garden be without
them? This question elicited loud
applause.</p>

<p>Several other persons followed with statements
of a similar character, which were
listened to with interest; but from their general
sameness it is not necessary to repeat them
here. After occupying nearly four hours, the
proceedings were brought to a close by a vote
of thanks, and the “street-sellers, performers,
and labourers,” separated in a most orderly
manner.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-IRISH"></a>OF THE STREET-IRISH.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Irish street-sellers are both a numerous
and peculiar class of people. It therefore behoves
me, for the due completeness of this work,
to say a few words upon their numbers, earnings,
condition, and mode of life.</p>

<p>The number of Irish street-sellers in the metropolis
has increased greatly of late years. One
gentleman, who had every means of being well-informed,
considered that it was not too much
to conclude, that, within these five years, the
numbers of the poor Irish people who gain a
scanty maintenance, or what is rather a substitute
for a maintenance, by trading, or begging,
or by carrying on the two avocations simultaneously
in the streets of London, had been
doubled in number.</p>

<p>I found among the English costermongers a
general dislike of the Irish. In fact, next to
a policeman, a genuine London costermonger
hates an Irishman, considering him an intruder.
Whether there be any traditional or hereditary
ill-feeling between them, originating from a
clannish feeling, I cannot ascertain. The costermongers
whom I questioned had no knowledge
of the feelings or prejudices of their predecessors,
but I am inclined to believe that the
prejudice is modern, and has originated in the
great influx of Irishmen and women, intermixing,
more especially during the last five years,
with the costermonger’s business. An Irish
costermonger, however, is no novelty in the
streets of London. “From the mention of
the costardmonger,” says Mr. Charles Knight,
“in the old dramatists, he appears to have been
frequently an Irishman.”</p>

<p>Of the Irish street-sellers, at present, it is
computed that there are, including men, women,
and children, upwards of 10,000. Assuming the
street-sellers attending the London fish and
green markets to be, with their families, 30,000
in number, and 7 in every 20 of these to be
Irish, we shall have rather more than the total
above given. Of this large body three-fourths
sell only fruit, and more especially nuts and
oranges; indeed, the orange-season is called the
“Irishman’s harvest.” The others deal in fish,
fruit, and vegetables, but these are principally
men. Some of the most wretched of the street-Irish
deal in such trifles as lucifer-matches,
water-cresses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am informed that the great mass of these
people have been connected, in some capacity or
other, with the culture of the land in Ireland.
The mechanics who have sought the metropolis
from the sister kingdom have become mixed with
their respective handicrafts in England, some of
the Irish&mdash;though only a few&mdash;taking rank with
the English skilled labourers. The greater
part of the Irish artizans who have arrived
within the last five years are to be found among
the most degraded of the tailors and shoemakers
who work at the East-end for the slop-masters.</p>

<p>A large class of the Irish who were agricultural
labourers in their country are to be found
among the men working for bricklayers, as well
as among the dock-labourers and excavators, &amp;c.
Wood chopping is an occupation greatly resorted
to by the Irish in London. Many of the Irish,
however, who are not regularly employed in
their respective callings, resort to the streets
when they cannot obtain work otherwise.</p>

<p>The Irish women and girls who sell fruit,
&amp;c., in the streets, depend almost entirely
on that mode of traffic for their subsistence.
They are a class not sufficiently taught to avail
themselves of the ordinary resources of women
in the humbler walk of life. Unskilled at their
needles, working for slop employers, even at
the commonest shirt-making, is impossible to
them. Their ignorance of household work,
moreover (for such description of work is unknown
in their wretched cabins in many parts of
Ireland), incapacitates them in a great measure
for such employments as “charing,” washing,
and ironing, as well as from regular domestic employment.
Thus there seems to remain to them
but one thing to do&mdash;as, indeed, was said to me by
one of themselves&mdash;viz., “to sell for a ha’pinny
the three apples which cost a farruthing.”</p>

<p>Very few of these women (nor, indeed, of the
men, though rather more of them than the women)
can read, and they are mostly all wretchedly
poor; but the women present two characteristics
which distinguish them from the London costerwomen
generally&mdash;they are chaste, and, unlike
the “coster girls,” very seldom form any con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>nection
without the sanction of the marriage
ceremony. They are, moreover, attentive to religious
observances.</p>

<p>The majority of the Irish street-sellers of both
sexes beg, and often very eloquently, as they
carry on their trade; and I was further assured,
that, but for this begging, some of them might
starve outright.</p>

<p>The greater proportion of the Irish street-sellers
are from Leinster and Munster, and a
considerable number come from Connaught.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Causes which have made the
Irish turn Costermongers.</span></h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the prejudices of the English
costers, I am of opinion that the Irishmen
and women who have become costermongers,
belong to a better class than the Irish labourers.
The Irishman may readily adapt himself, in a
strange place, to labour, though not to trade;
but these costers are&mdash;or the majority at least
are&mdash;poor persevering traders enough.</p>

<p>The most intelligent and prosperous of the
street-Irish are those who have “risen”&mdash;for so
I heard it expressed&mdash;“into regular costers.”
The untaught Irishmen’s capabilities, as I have
before remarked, with all his powers of speech
and quickness of apprehension, are far less fitted
for “buying in the cheapest market and selling
in the dearest” than for mere physical employment.
Hence those who take to street-trading
for a living seldom prosper in it, and
three-fourths of the street-Irish confine their
dealings to such articles as are easy of sale, like
apples, nuts, or oranges, for they are rarely
masters of purchasing to advantage, and seem to
know little about tale or measure, beyond the
most familiar quantities. Compared with an
acute costermonger, the mere apple-seller is but
as the labourer to the artizan.</p>

<p>One of the principal causes why the Irish
costermongers have increased so extensively of
late years, is to be found in the fact that the
labouring classes, (and of them chiefly the class
employed in the culture of land,) have been
driven over from “the sister Isle” more thickly
for the last four or five years than formerly.
Several circumstances have conspired to effect
this.&mdash;First, they were driven over by the famine,
when they could not procure, or began to fear
that soon they could not procure, food to eat.
Secondly, they were forced to take refuge in
this country by the evictions, when their landlords
had left them no roof to shelter them in
their own. (The shifts, the devices, the plans,
to which numbers of these poor creatures had
recourse, to raise the means of quitting Ireland
for England&mdash;or for anywhere&mdash;will present a
very remarkable chapter at some future period.)
Thirdly, though the better class of small
farmers who have emigrated from Ireland, in
hopes of “bettering themselves,” have mostly
sought the shores of North America, still some
who have reached this country have at last
settled into street-sellers. And, fourthly, many
who have come over here only for the
harvest have been either induced or compelled
to stay.</p>

<p>Another main cause is, that the Irish, as
labourers, can seldom obtain work all the year
through, and thus the ranks of the Irish street-sellers
are recruited every winter by the slackness
of certain periodic trades in which they
are largely employed&mdash;such as hodmen, dock-work,
excavating, and the like. They are,
therefore, driven by want of employment to the
winter sale of oranges and nuts. These circumstances
have a doubly malefic effect, as
the increase of costers accrues in the winter
months, and there are consequently the most
sellers when there are the fewest buyers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the cessation of work in the construction
of railways, compared with the abundance
of employment which attracted so many
to this country during the railway mania,
has been another fertile cause of there being so
many Irish in the London streets.</p>

<p>The prevalence of Irish women and children
among street-sellers is easily accounted for&mdash;they
are, as I said before, unable to do anything
else to eke out the means of their husbands
or parents. A needle is as useless in their
fingers as a pen.</p>

<p>Bitterly as many of these people suffer in
this country, grievous and often eloquent as are
their statements, I met with <i>none</i> who did not
manifest repugnance at the suggestion of a
return to Ireland. If asked why they objected
to return, the response was usually in the form of
a question: “Shure thin, sir, and what good
could I do there?” Neither can I say that I
heard any of these people express any love for
their country, though they often spoke with
great affection of their friends.</p>

<p>From an Irish costermonger, a middle-aged
man, with a physiognomy best known as “Irish,”
and dressed in corduroy trousers, with a loose
great-coat, far too big for him, buttoned about
him, I had the following statement:</p>

<p>“I had a bit o’ land, yer honor, in County
Limerick. Well, it wasn’t just a farrum, nor
what ye would call a garden here, but my father
lived and died on it&mdash;glory be to God!&mdash;and
brought up me and my sister on it. It was
about an acre, and the taties was well known
to be good. But the sore times came, and the
taties was afflicted, and the wife and me&mdash;I
have no childer&mdash;hadn’t a bite nor a sup, but
wather to live on, and an igg or two. I filt the
famine a-comin’. I saw people a-feedin’ on the
wild green things, and as I had not such a bad
take, I got Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (he was the head master’s
agent) to give me 28<i>s.</i> for possission in quietness,
and I sould some poulthry I had&mdash;their
iggs was a blessin’ to keep the life in us&mdash;I
sould them in Limerick for 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&mdash;the poor
things&mdash;four of them. The furnithur’ I sould to
the nabors, for somehow about 6<i>s.</i> Its the thruth
I’m ay-tellin’ of you, sir, and there’s 2<i>s.</i> owin’
of it still, and will be a perpitual loss. The wife
and me walked to Dublin, though we had betther
have gone by the ‘long say,’ but I didn’t under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>stand
it thin, and we got to Liverpool. Then
sorrow’s the taste of worruk could I git, beyant
oncte 3<i>s.</i> for two days harrud porthering, that
broke my back half in two. I was tould I’d
do betther in London, and so, glory be to God!
I have&mdash;perhaps I have. I knew Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, he
porthers at Covent-garden, and I made him out,
and hilped him in any long distance of a job.
As I’d been used to farrumin’ I thought it good
raison I should be a costermonger, as they call
it here. I can read and write too. And some
good Christian&mdash;the heavens light him to glory
when he’s gone!&mdash;I don’t know who he was&mdash;advanced
me 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;or he gave it me, so to spake,
through Father &mdash;&mdash;,” (a Roman Catholic
priest.) “We earrun what keeps the life in us. I
don’t go to markit, but buy of a fair dealin’ man&mdash;so
I count him&mdash;though he’s harrud sometimes.
I can’t till how many Irishmen is in the thrade.
There’s many has been brought down to it by
the famin’ and the changes. I don’t go much
among the English street-dalers. They talk like
haythens. I never miss mass on a Sunday, and
they don’t know what the blissed mass manes.
I’m almost glad I have no childer, to see how
they’re raired here. Indeed, sir, they’re not
raired at all&mdash;they run wild. They haven’t the
fear of God or the saints. They’d hang a praste&mdash;glory
be to God! they would.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How the Street-Irish displanted the
Street-Jews in the Orange Trade.</span></h3>

<p>The Jews, in the streets, while acting as costermongers,
never “worked a barrow,” nor
dealt in the more ponderous and least profitable
articles of the trade, such as turnips
and cabbages. They however, had, at one
period, the chief possession of a portion of
the trade which the “regular hands” do not
consider proper costermongering, and which is
now chiefly confined to the Irish&mdash;viz.: orange
selling.</p>

<p>The trade was, not many years ago, confined
almost entirely to the Jew boys, who kept aloof
from the vagrant lads of the streets, or mixed
with them only in the cheap theatres and
concert-rooms. A person who had had great
experience at what was, till recently, one of
the greatest “coaching inns,” told me that,
speaking within his own recollection and from
his own observation, he thought the sale
of oranges was not so much in the hands of
the Jew lads until about forty years back.
The orange monopoly, so to speak, was
established by the street-Jews, about 1810, or
three or four years previous to that date, when
recruiting and local soldiering were at their
height, and when a great number of the vagabond
or “roving” population, who in one
capacity or other now throng the streets, were
induced to enlist. The young Jews never entered
the ranks of the army. The streets were thus
in a measure cleared for them, and the itinerant
orange-trade fell almost entirely into their
hands. Some of the young Jews gained, I am
assured, at least 100<i>l.</i> a year in this traffic.
The numbers of country people who hastened to
London on the occasion of the Allied Sovereigns’
visit in 1814&mdash;many wealthy persons
then seeing the capital for the first time&mdash;afforded
an excellent market to these dealers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the perseverance of the Jew orange
boys was not to be overcome; they would follow
a man who even looked encouragingly at their
wares for a mile or two. The great resort of
these Jew dealers&mdash;who eschewed night-work
generally, and left the theatre-doors to old men
and women of all ages&mdash;was at the coaching inns;
for year by year, after the peace of 1815, the improvement
of the roads and the consequent
increase of travellers to London, progressed.</p>

<p>About 1825, as nearly as my informant could
recollect, these keen young traders began to add
the sale of other goods to their oranges, pressing
them upon the notice of those who were
leaving or visiting London by the different
coaches. So much was this the case, that it was
a common remark at that time, that no one
could reach or leave the metropolis, even for
the shortest journey, without being expected to
be in urgent want of oranges and lemons, black-lead
pencils, sticks of sealing-wax, many-bladed
pen-knives, pocket-combs, razors, strops,
braces, and sponges. To pursue the sale of the
last-mentioned articles&mdash;they being found, I
presume, to be more profitable&mdash;some of the
street-Jews began to abandon the sale of
oranges and lemons; and it was upon this,
that the trade was “taken up” by the wives
and children of the Irish bricklayers’ labourers,
and of other Irish work-people then resident in
London. The numbers of Irish in the metropolis
at that time began to increase rapidly;
for twenty years ago, they resorted numerously
to England to gather in the harvest, and those
who had been employed in contiguous counties
during the autumn, made for London in the
winter. “I can’t say they were well off, sir,”
said one man to me, “but they liked bread
and herrings, or bread and tea&mdash;better than
potatoes without bread at home.” From 1836
to 1840, I was informed, the Irish gradually
superseded the Jews in the fruit traffic about
the coaching-houses. One reason for this was,
that they were far more eloquent, begging
pathetically, and with many benedictions on
their listeners. The Jews never begged, I was
told; “they were merely traders.” Another
reason was, that the Irish, men or lads, who
had entered into the fruit trade in the coach-yards,
would not only sell and beg, but were
ready to “lend a hand” to any over-burthened
coach-porter. This the Jews never did, and in
that way the people of the yard came to encourage
the Irish to the prejudice of the
Jews. At present, I understand that, with the
exception of one or two in the city, no Jews
vend oranges in the streets, and that the trade
is almost entirely in the hands of the Irish.</p>

<p>Another reason why the Irish could supersede
and even undersell the Jews and regular costermongers
was this, as I am informed on ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>cellent
authority:&mdash;Father Mathew, a dozen
years back, made temperance societies popular
in Ireland. Many of the itinerant Irish, especially
the younger classes, were “temperance
men.” Thus the Irish could live as sparely as
the Jew, but they did not, like him, squander
any money for the evening’s amusement, at the
concert or the theatre.</p>

<p>I inquired what might be the number of the
Jews plying, so to speak, at the coaching inns,
and was assured that it was less numerous than
was generally imagined. One man computed
it at 300 individuals, all under 21; another at
only 200; perhaps the mean, or 250, might be
about the mark. The number was naturally
considered greater, I was told, because the same
set of street traders were seen over and over
again. The Jews knew when the coaches were
to arrive and when they started, and they would
hurry, after availing themselves of a departure,
from one inn&mdash;the Belle Sauvage, Ludgate-hill,
for instance&mdash;to take advantage of an arrival at
another&mdash;say the Saracen’s Head, Snow-hill.
Thus they appeared everywhere, but were the
same individuals.</p>

<p>I inquired to what calling the youthful Jews,
thus driven from their partially monopolized
street commerce, had devoted themselves, and
was told that even when the orange and hawking
trade was at the best, the Jews rarely carried
it on after they were twenty-two or twenty-three,
but that they then resorted to some more wholesale
calling, such as the purchase of nuts or
foreign grapes, at public sales. At present, I
am informed, they are more thickly than ever
engaged in these trades, as well as in two new
avocations, that have been established within
these few years,&mdash;the sale of the Bahama pine-apples
and of the Spanish and Portuguese
onions.</p>

<p>About the Royal Exchange, Jew boys still
hawk pencils, etc., but the number engaged in
this pursuit throughout London is not, as far as
I can ascertain, above one-eighth&mdash;if an eighth&mdash;of
what it was even twelve years ago.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Religion of the Street-Irish.</span></h3>

<p>Having now given a brief sketch as to how the
Irish people have come to form so large a
proportion of the London street-sellers, I shall
proceed, as I did with the English costermongers,
to furnish the reader with a short account
of their religious, moral, intellectual, and physical
condition, so that he may be able to contrast
the habits and circumstances of the one
class with those of the other. First, of the religion
of the Irish street-folk.</p>

<p>Almost all the street-Irish are Roman Catholics.
Of course I can but speak generally; but
during my inquiry I met with only two who
said they were Protestants, and when I came to
converse with them, I found out that they were
partly ignorant of, and partly indifferent to, any
religion whatever. An Irish Protestant gentleman
said to me: “You may depend upon it, if
ever you meet any of my poor countrymen who
will not talk to you about religion, they either
know or care nothing about it; for the religious
spirit runs high in Ireland, and Protestants and
Catholics are easily led to converse about their
faith.”</p>

<p>I found that <i>some</i> of the Irish Roman Catholics&mdash;but
they had been for many years resident
in England, and that among the poorest or
vagrant class of the English&mdash;had become indifferent
to their creed, and did not attend their
chapels, unless at the great fasts or festivals, and
this they did only occasionally. One old stall-keeper,
who had been in London nearly thirty
years, said to me: “Ah! God knows, sir, I
ought to attend mass every Sunday, but I
haven’t for a many years, barrin’ Christmas-day
and such times. But I’ll thry and go more
rigular, plase God.” This man seemed to resent,
as a sort of indignity, my question if he
ever attended any other place of worship. “Av
coorse not!” was the reply.</p>

<p>One Irishman, also a fruit-seller, with a well-stocked
barrow, and without the complaint of
poverty common among his class, entered keenly
into the subject of his religious faith when I
introduced it. He was born in Ireland, but had
been in England since he was five or six. He
was a good-looking, fresh-coloured man, of
thirty or upwards, and could read and write well.
He spoke without bitterness, though zealously
enough. “Perhaps, sir, you are a gintleman
connected with the Protistant clargy,” he asked,
“or a missionary?” On my stating that I had
no claim to either character, he resumed: “Will,
sir, it don’t matther. All the worruld may know
my riligion, and I wish all the worruld was of
my riligion, and betther min in it than I am; I
do, indeed. I’m a Roman Catholic, sir;” [here
he made the sign of the cross]; “God be praised
for it! O yis, I know all about Cardinal Wiseman.
It’s the will of God, I feel sure, that he’s
to be ’stablished here, and it’s no use ribillin’
against that. I’ve nothing to say against Protistints.
I’ve heard it said, ‘It’s best to pray
for them.’ The street-people that call thimselves
Protistants are no riligion at all at all. I
serruve Protistant gintlemen and ladies too, and
sometimes they talk to me kindly about religion.
They’re good custhomers, and I have no doubt
good people. I can’t say what their lot may be
in another worruld for not being of the true
faith. No, sir, I’ll give no opinions&mdash;none.”</p>

<p>This man gave me a clear account of his
belief that the Blessed Virgin (he crossed himself
repeatedly as he spoke) was the mother of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and was a mediator with
our Lord, who was God of heaven and earth&mdash;of
the duty of praying to the holy saints&mdash;of
attending mass&mdash;(“but the priest,” he said,
“won’t exact too much of a poor man, either
about that or about fasting”)&mdash;of going to confession
at Easter and Christmas times, at the
least&mdash;of receiving the body of Christ, “the rale
prisince,” in the holy sacrament&mdash;of keeping
all God’s commandments&mdash;of purgatory being
a purgation of sins&mdash;and of heaven and hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I found the majority of those I spoke with, at
least as earnest in their faith, if they were not
as well instructed in it as my informant, who
may be cited as an example of the better class
of street-sellers.</p>

<p>Another Irishman,&mdash;who may be taken as a
type of the less informed, and who had been
between two and three years in England, having
been disappointed in emigrating to America
with his wife and two children,&mdash;gave me the
following account, but not without considering
and hesitating. He was a very melancholy
looking man, tall and spare, and decently clad.
He and his family were living upon 8<i>d.</i> a day,
which he earned by sweeping a crossing. He
had been prevented by ill health from earning
2<i>l.</i>, which he could have made, he told me, in
harvest time, as a store against winter. He had
been a street-seller, and so had his wife; and
she would be so again as soon as he could raise
2<i>s.</i> to buy her a stock of apples. He said,
touching his hat at each holy name,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sure, yis, sir, I’m a Roman Cartholic, and
go to mass every Sunday. Jesus Christ? O yis,”
(hesitating, but proceeding readily after a word
of prompting), “he is the Lord our Saviour, and
the Son of the Holy Virgin. The blessed saints?
Yis, sir, yis. The praste prays for them. I&mdash;I
mane prays to them. O yis. I pray to them
mysilf ivery night for a blissin’, and to rise me
out of my misery. No, sir, I can’t say I know
what the mass is about. I don’t know what I’m
prayin’ for thin, only that it’s right. A poor
man, that can neither read nor write&mdash;I wish I
could and I might do betther&mdash;can’t understand
it; it’s all in Latin. I’ve heard about
Cardinal Wiseman. It’ll do us no good sir;
it’ll only set people more against us. But it
ain’t poor min’s fault.”</p>

<p>As I was anxious to witness the religious zeal
that characterizes these people, I obtained permission
to follow one of the priests as he made
his rounds among his flock. Everywhere the
people ran out to meet him. He had just returned
to them I found, and the news spread
round, and women crowded to their door-steps,
and came creeping up from the cellars through
the trap-doors, merely to curtsey to him. One
old crone, as he passed, cried, “You’re a good
father, Heaven comfort you,” and the boys playing
about stood still to watch him. A lad, in a
man’s tail coat and a shirt-collar that nearly
covered in his head&mdash;like the paper round a
bouquet&mdash;was fortunate enough to be noticed,
and his eyes sparkled, as he touched his hair
at each word he spoke in answer. At a conversation
that took place between the priest and
a woman who kept a dry fish-stall, the dame
excused herself for not having been up to take
tea “with his rivirince’s mother lately, for thrade
had been so bisy, and night was the fullest
time.” Even as the priest walked along the
street, boys running at full speed would pull up
to touch their hair, and the stall-women would
rise from their baskets; while all noise&mdash;even a
quarrel&mdash;ceased until he had passed by. Still
there was no look of fear in the people. He
called them all by their names, and asked after
their families, and once or twice the “father”
was taken aside and held by the button while
some point that required his advice was whispered
in his ear.</p>

<p>The religious fervour of the people whom I
saw was intense. At one house that I entered,
the woman set me marvelling at the strength of
her zeal, by showing me how she contrived to
have in her sitting-room a sanctuary to pray
before every night and morning, and even in
the day, “when she felt weary and lonesome.”
The room was rudely enough furnished, and the
only decent table was covered with a new piece
of varnished cloth; still before a rude print of
our Saviour there were placed two old plated
candlesticks, pink, with the copper shining
through; and here it was that she told her
beads. In her bed-room, too, was a coloured
engraving of the “Blessed Lady,” which she
never passed without curtseying to.</p>

<p>Of course I detail these matters as mere facts,
without desiring to offer any opinion here, either
as to the benefit or otherwise of the creed in
question. As I had shown how the English
costermonger neither had nor knew any religion
whatever, it became my duty to give the reader
a view of the religion of the Irish street-sellers.
In order to be able to do so as truthfully as
possible, I placed myself in communication with
those parties who were in a position to give me
the best information on the subject. The result
is given above, in all the simplicity and impartiality
of history.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Education, Literature, Amusements,
and Politics of the Street-irish.</span></h3>

<p>These several heads have often required from
me lengthened notices, but as regards the class
I am now describing they may be dismissed
briefly enough. The majority of the street-Irish
whom I saw were unable to read, but I found
those who had no knowledge of reading&mdash;(and
the same remark applies to the English street-sellers
as well)&mdash;regret their inability, and say,
“I wish I could read, sir; I’d be better off
now.” On the other hand, those who had a
knowledge of reading and writing, said frequently
enough, “Why, yes, sir, I <i>can</i> read
and write, but it’s been no good to me,” as if
they had been disappointed in their expectations
as to the benefits attendant upon scholarship.
I am inclined to think, however, that a greater
anxiety exists among the poor generally, to
have some schooling provided for their children,
than was the case a few years back. One
Irishman attributed this to the increased number
of Roman Catholic schools, “for the more
schools there are,” he said, “the more people
think about schooling their children.”</p>

<p>The literature, or reading, of the street-Irish
is, I believe, confined to Roman Catholic books,
such as the “Lives of the Saints,” published in
a cheap form; one, and only one, I found with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the “Nation” newspaper. The very poor have
no leisure to read. During three days spent in
visiting the slop-workers at the East end of
the town, not so much as the fragment of a
leaf of a book was seen.</p>

<p>The amusements of the street-Irish are not
those of the English costermongers&mdash;though
there are exceptions, of course, to the remark.
The Irish fathers and mothers do not allow their
daughters, even when they possess the means, to
resort to the “penny gaffs” or the “twopenny
hops,” unaccompanied by them. Some of the
men frequent the beer-shops, and are inveterate
drinkers and smokers too. I did not hear of any
amusements popular among, or much resorted
to, by the Irishmen, except dancing parties at
one another’s houses, where they jig and reel
furiously. They frequent raffles also, but the
article is often never thrown for, and the evening
is spent in dancing.</p>

<p>I may here observe&mdash;in reference to the
statement that Irish parents will not expose
their daughters to the risk of what they consider
corrupt influences&mdash;that when a young
Irishwoman <i>does</i> break through the pale of
chastity, she often becomes, as I was assured,
one of the most violent and depraved of, perhaps,
<i>the</i> most depraved class.</p>

<p>Of politics, I think, the street-Irish understand
nothing, and my own observations in this
respect were confirmed by a remark made to
me by an Irish gentleman: “Their politics are
either a dead letter, or the politics of their
priests.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Homes of the Street-Irish.</span></h3>

<p>In almost all of the poorer districts of London
are to be found “nests of Irish”&mdash;as they are
called&mdash;or courts inhabited solely by the Irish
costermongers. These people form separate
colonies, rarely visiting or mingling with the
English costers. It is curious, on walking
through one of these settlements, to notice
the manner in which the Irish deal among
themselves&mdash;street-seller buying of street-seller.
Even in some of the smallest courts there may
be seen stalls of vegetables, dried herrings, or
salt cod, thriving, on the associative principle,
by mutual support.</p>

<p>The parts of London that are the most thickly
populated with Irish lie about Brook-street, Ratcliff-cross,
down both sides of the Commercial-road,
and in Rosemary-lane, though nearly all
the “coster-districts” cited at p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, have their
Irish settlements&mdash;Cromer-street, Saffron-hill
and King-street, Drury-lane, for instance, being
thickly peopled with the Irish; but the places
I have mentioned above are peculiarly distinguished,
by being almost entirely peopled by
visitors from the sister isle.</p>

<p>The same system of immigration is pursued
in London as in America. As soon as the first
settler is thriving in his newly chosen country,
a certain portion of his or her earnings are
carefully hoarded up, until they are sufficient
to pay for the removal of another member of
the family to England; then one of the friends
left “at home” is sent for; and thus by degrees
the entire family is got over, and once more
united.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no quarter of London where
the habits and habitations of the Irish can be
better seen and studied than in Rosemary-lane,
and the little courts and alleys that spring from
it on each side. Some of these courts have other
courts branching off from them, so that the locality
is a perfect labyrinth of “blind alleys;” and
when once in the heart of the maze it is difficult
to find the path that leads to the main-road.
As you walk down “the lane,” and peep through
the narrow openings between the houses, the
place seems like a huge peep-show, with dark
holes of gateways to look through, while the
court within appears bright with the daylight;
and down it are seen rough-headed urchins
running with their feet bare through the puddles,
and bonnetless girls, huddled in shawls,
lolling against the door-posts. Sometimes
you see a long narrow alley, with the houses
so close together that opposite neighbours are
talking from their windows; while the ropes,
stretched zig-zag from wall to wall, afford
just room enough to dry a blanket or a couple
of shirts, that swell out dropsically in the
wind.</p>

<p>I visited one of the paved yards round which
the Irish live, and found that it had been turned
into a complete drying-ground, with shirts,
gowns, and petticoats of every description and
colour. The buildings at the end were completely
hidden by “the things,” and the air felt
damp and chilly, and smelt of soap-suds. The
gutter was filled with dirty gray water emptied
from the wash-tubs, and on the top were the
thick bubbles floating about under the breath of
the boys “playing at boats” with them.</p>

<p>It is the custom with the inhabitants of these
courts and alleys to assemble at the entrance
with their baskets, and chat and smoke away the
morning. Every court entrance has its little
group of girls and women, lolling listlessly
against the sides, with their heads uncovered,
and their luxuriant hair fuzzy as oakum. It is
peculiar with the Irish women that&mdash;after having
been accustomed to their hoods&mdash;they seldom
wear bonnets, unless on a long journey. Nearly
all of them, too, have a thick plaid shawl, which
they keep on all the day through, with their
hands covered under it. At the mouth of the
only thoroughfare deserving of the name of
street&mdash;for a cart could just go through it&mdash;were
congregated about thirty men and women, who
rented rooms in the houses on each side of the
road. Six women, with baskets of dried herrings,
were crouching in a line on the kerb-stone
with the fish before them; their legs were
drawn up so closely to their bodies that the shawl
covered the entire figure, and they looked very
like the podgy “tombolers” sold by the Italian
boys. As all their wares were alike, it was puzzling
work to imagine how, without the strongest
opposition, they could each obtain a living. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
men were dressed in long-tail coats, with one or
two brass buttons. One old dame, with a face
wrinkled like a dried plum, had her cloak placed
over her head like a hood, and the grisly hair
hung down in matted hanks about her face, her
black eyes shining between the locks like those
of a Skye terrier; beside her was another old
woman smoking a pipe so short that her nose
reached over the bowl.</p>

<p>After looking at the low foreheads and long
bulging upper lips of some of the group, it was
pleasant to gaze upon the pretty faces of the
one or two girls that lolled against the wall.
Their black hair, smoothed with grease, and
shining almost as if “japanned,” and their large
gray eyes with the thick dark fringe of lash,
seemed out of place among the hard features
of their companions. It was only by looking at
the short petticoats and large feet you could
assure yourself that they belonged to the same
class.</p>

<p>In all the houses that I entered were traces of
household care and neatness that I had little
expected to have seen. The cupboard fastened
in the corner of the room, and stocked with mugs
and cups, the mantelpiece with its images, and
the walls covered with showy-coloured prints of
saints and martyrs, gave an air of comfort that
strangely disagreed with the reports of the cabins
in “ould Ireland.” As the doors to the houses
were nearly all of them kept open, I could, even
whilst walking along, gain some notion of the
furniture of the homes. In one house that I
visited there was a family of five persons, living
on the ground floor and occupying two rooms.
The boards were strewn with red sand, and the
front apartment had three beds in it, with the
printed curtains drawn closely round. In a
dark room, at the back, lived the family itself.
It was fitted up as a parlour, and crowded to
excess with chairs and tables, the very staircase
having pictures fastened against the wooden
partition. The fire, although it was midday,
and a warm autumn morning, served as much
for light as for heat, and round it crouched the
mother, children, and visitors, bending over the
flame as if in the severest winter time. In a
room above this were a man and woman lately
arrived in England. The woman sat huddled
up in a corner smoking, with the husband
standing over her in, what appeared at first, a
menacing attitude; I was informed, however,
that they were only planning for the future.
This room was perfectly empty of furniture, and
the once white-washed walls were black, excepting
the little square patches which showed
where the pictures of the former tenants had
hung. In another room, I found a home so
small and full of furniture, that it was almost a
curiosity for domestic management. The bed,
with its chintz curtains looped up, filled one
end of the apartment, but the mattress of it
served as a long bench for the visitors to sit on.
The table was so large that it divided the room
in two, and if there was one picture there must
have been thirty&mdash;all of “holy men,” with yellow
glories round their heads. The window-ledge
was dressed out with crockery, and in a tumbler
were placed the beads. The old dame herself
was as curious as her room. Her shawl was
fastened over her large frilled cap. She had a
little “button” of a nose, with the nostrils entering
her face like bullet holes. She wore over
her gown an old pilot coat, well-stained with
fish slime, and her petticoats being short, she
had very much the appearance of a Dutch fisherman
or stage smuggler.</p>

<p>Her story was affecting&mdash;made more so,
perhaps, by the emotional manner in which she
related it. Nine years ago “the father” of
the district&mdash;“the Blissed Lady guard him!”&mdash;had
found her late at night, rolling in the
gutter, and the boys pelting her with orange-peel
and mud. She was drunk&mdash;“the Lorrud
pass by her”&mdash;and when she came to, she
found herself in the chapel, lying before the
sanctuary, “under the shadow of the holy cross.”
Watching over her was the “good father,”
trying to bring back her consciousness. He
spoke to her of her wickedness, and before she
left she took the pledge of temperance. From
that time she prospered, and the 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
“father” gave her “had God’s blissin’ in it,”
for she became the best dressed woman in the
court, and in less than three years had 15<i>l.</i> in
the savings’ bank, “the father&mdash;Heaven chirish
him”&mdash;keeping her book for her, as he did for
other poor people. She also joined “the Association
of the Blissed Lady,” (and bought herself
the dress of the order “a beautiful grane
vilvit, which she had now, and which same
cost her 30<i>s.</i>”), and then she was secure against
want in old age and sickness. But after nine
years prudence and comfort, a brother of hers
returned home from the army, with a pension of
1<i>s.</i> a day. He was wild, and persuaded her to
break her pledge, and in a short time he got all
her savings from her and spent every penny. She
could’nt shake him off, “for he was the only
kin she had on airth,” and “she must love her
own flish and bones.” Then began her misery.
“It plased God to visit her ould limbs with
aches and throubles, and her hips swole with
the cowld,” so that she was at last forced into
a hospital, and all that was left of her store was
“aten up by sufferin’s.” This, she assured
me, all came about by the “good father’s”
leaving that parish for another one, but now he
had returned to them again, and, with his help
and God’s blessing, she would yet prosper once
more.</p>

<p>Whilst I was in the room, the father entered,
and “old Norah,” half-divided between joy
at seeing him and shame at “being again a
beggar,” laughed and wept at the same time.
She stood wiping her eyes with the shawl, and
groaning out blessings on “his rivirince’s hid,”
begging of him not “to scould her for she was
a wake woman.” The renegade brother was
had in to receive a lecture from “his rivirince.”
A more sottish idiotic face it would be difficult
to imagine. He stood with his hands hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
down like the paws of a dog begging, and his
two small eyes stared in the face of the priest, as
he censured him, without the least expression
even of consciousness. Old Norah stood by,
groaning like a bagpipe, and writhing while the
father spoke to her “own brother,” as though
every reproach were meant for her.</p>

<p>The one thing that struck me during my visit
to this neighbourhood, was the apparent listlessness
and lazy appearance of the people. The
boys at play were the only beings who seemed
to have any life in their actions. The women
in their plaid shawls strolled along the pavements,
stopping each friend for a chat, or
joining some circle, and leaning against the wall
as though utterly deficient in energy. The men
smoked, with their hands in their pockets, listening
to the old crones talking, and only now
and then grunting out a reply when a question
was directly put to them. And yet it is curious
that these people, who here seemed as inactive
as negroes, will perform the severest bodily
labour, undertaking tasks that the English are
almost unfitted for.</p>

<p>To complete this account, I subjoin a brief
description of the lodging-houses resorted to
by the Irish immigrants on their arrival in
this country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Irish Lodging-houses for Immigrants.</span></h3>

<p>Often an Irish immigrant, whose object is to
settle in London, arrives by the Cork steamer
without knowing a single friend to whom he
can apply for house-room or assistance of any
kind. Sometimes a whole family is landed late
at night, worn out by sickness and the terrible
fatigues of a three days’ deck passage, almost
paralysed by exhaustion, and scarcely able to
speak English enough to inquire for shelter till
morning.</p>

<p>If the immigrants, however, are bound for
America, their lot is very different. Then they
are consigned to some agent in London, who
is always on the wharf at the time the steamer
arrives, and takes the strangers to the homes
he has prepared for them until the New York
packet starts. During the two or three days’
necessary stay in London, they are provided for
at the agent’s expense, and no trouble is experienced
by the travellers. A large provision-merchant
in the city told me that he often,
during the season, had as many as 500 Irish
consigned to him by one vessel, so that to
lead them to their lodgings was like walking at
the head of a regiment of recruits.</p>

<p>The necessities of the immigrants in London
have caused several of their countrymen to open
lodging-houses in the courts about Rosemary-lane;
these men attend the coming in of the
Cork steamer, and seek for customers among the
poorest of the poor, after the manner of touters
to a sea-side hotel.</p>

<p>The immigrants’-houses are of two kinds&mdash;clean
and dirty. The better class of Irish
lodging-houses almost startle one by the comfort
and cleanliness of the rooms; for after the
descriptions you hear of the state in which the
deck passengers are landed from the Irish boats,
their clothes stained with the manure of the
pigs, and drenched with the spray, you somehow
expect to find all the accommodations
disgusting and unwholesome. But one in
particular, that I visited, had the floor clean,
and sprinkled with red sand, while the windows
were sound, bright, and transparent.
The hobs of the large fire-place were piled
up with bright tin pots, and the chimney
piece was white and red with the china
images ranged upon it. In one corner of
the principal apartment there stood two or
three boxes still corded up, and with bundles
strung to the sides, and against the wall was
hung a bunch of blue cloaks, such as the
Irishwomen wear. The proprietor of the house,
who was dressed in a gray tail-coat and knee-breeches,
that had somewhat the effect of a footman’s
livery, told me that he had received
seven lodgers the day before, but six were men,
and they were all out seeking for work. In
front of the fire sat a woman, bending over it so
close that the bright cotton gown she had on
smelt of scorching. Her feet were bare, and
she held the soles of them near to the bars,
curling her toes about with the heat. She was
a short, thick-set woman, with a pair of wonderfully
muscular arms crossed over her bosom,
and her loose rusty hair streaming over her
neck. It was in vain that I spoke to her
about her journey, for she wouldn’t answer me,
but kept her round, open eyes fixed on my face
with a wild, nervous look, following me about
with them everywhere.</p>

<p>Across the room hung a line, with the newly-washed
and well-patched clothes of the immigrants
hanging to it, and on a side-table were
the six yellow basins that had been used for
the men’s breakfasts. During my visit, the
neighbours, having observed a strange gentleman
enter, came pouring in, each proffering
some fresh bit of news about their newly-arrived
countrymen. I was nearly stunned by
half-a-dozen voices speaking together, and telling
me how the poor people had been four days
“at say,” so that they were glad to get near the
pigs for “warrumth,” and instructing me as to
the best manner of laying out the sum of
money that it was supposed I was about to
shower down upon the immigrants.</p>

<p>In one of the worst class of lodging-houses I
found ten human beings living together in a
small room. The apartment was entirely devoid
of all furniture, excepting an old mattrass
rolled up against the wall, and a dirty piece of
cloth hung across one corner, to screen the
women whilst dressing. An old man, the father
of five out of the ten, was seated on a tea-chest,
mending shoes, and the other men were looking
on with their hands in their pockets. Two
girls and a woman were huddled together on
the floor in front of the fire, talking in Irish.
All these people seemed to be utterly devoid
of energy, and the men moved about so lazily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that I couldn’t help asking some of them if
they had tried to obtain work. Every one
turned to a good-looking young fellow lolling
against the wall, as if they expected him to
answer for them. “Ah, sure, and that they
have,” was the reply; “it’s the docks they
have tried, worrus luck.” The others appeared
struck with the truthfulness of the answer,
for they all shook their heads, and said, “Sure
an’ that’s thruth, anyhow.” Here my Irish
guide ventured an observation, by remarking
solemnly, “It’s no use tilling a lie;” to which
the whole room assented, by exclaiming altogether,
“Thrue for you, Norah.” The chosen
spokesman then told me, “They paid half-a-crown
a week for the room, and that was as much
as they could earrun, and it was starruve they
should if the neighbours didn’t hilp them a
bit.” I asked them if they were better off
over here than when in Ireland, but could get
no direct answer, for my question only gave
rise to a political discussion. “There’s plenty
of food over here,” said the spokesman, addressing
his companions as much as myself,
“plenty of ’taties&mdash;plenty of mate&mdash;plenty of
porruk.” “But where the use,” observed my
guide, “if there’s no money to buy ’em
wid?” to which the audience muttered, “Thrue
for you again, Norah;” and so it went on, each
one pleading poverty in the most eloquent
style.</p>

<p>After I had left, the young fellow who had
acted as spokesman followed me into the street,
and taking me into a corner, told me that he
was a “sailor by thrade, but had lost his ‘rigisthration-ticket,’
or he’d have got a berruth long
since, and that it was all for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> he wasn’t
at say.”</p>

<p>Concerning the number of Irish immigrants,
I have obtained the following information:</p>

<p>The great influx of the Irish into London
was in the year of the famine, 1847-8. This
cannot be better shown than by citing the returns
of the number of persons admitted into
the Asylum for the Houseless Poor, in Playhouse-yard,
Cripplegate. These returns I obtained
for fourteen years, and the average number
of admissions of the applicants from all
parts during that time was 8,794 yearly. Of
these, the Irish averaged 2,455 yearly, or considerably
more than a fourth of the whole
number received. The total number of applicants
thus sheltered in the fourteen years was
130,625, of which the Irish numbered 34,378.
The smallest number of Irish (men, women,
and children) admitted, was in 1834-5, about
300; in 1846-7, it was as many as 7,576, while
in 1847-8, it was 10,756, and in 1848-9, 5,068.</p>

<p>But it was into Liverpool that the tide of immigration
flowed the strongest, in the calamitous
year of the famine. “Between the 13th Jan.,
and the 13th Dec., both inclusive,” writes Mr.
Rushton, the Liverpool magistrate, to Sir G.
Grey, on the 21st April last, “296,231 persons
landed in this port (Liverpool) from Ireland.
Of this vast number, about 130,000 emigrated to
the United States; some 50,000 were passengers
on business; and the remainder (161,231),
mere paupers, half-naked and starving, landed,
for the most part, during the winter, and became,
immediately on landing, applicants for parochial
relief. You already know the immediate results
of this accumulation of misery in the crowded
town of Liverpool; of the cost of relief at once
rendered necessary to prevent the thousands of
hungry and naked Irish perishing in our streets;
and also of the cost of the pestilence which
generally follows in the train of famine and
misery such as we then had to encounter....
Hundreds of patients perished, notwithstanding
all efforts made to save them; and ten Roman
Catholic and one Protestant clergyman, many
parochial officers, and many medical men, who
devoted themselves to the task of alleviating the
sufferings of the wretched, died in the discharge
of these high duties.”</p>

<p>Great numbers of these people were, at the
same time, also conveyed from Ireland to Wales,
especially to Newport. They were brought over
by coal-vessels as a return cargo&mdash;a living ballast&mdash;2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> being the highest fare, and were huddled
together like pigs. The manager of the Newport
tramp-house has stated concerning these people,
“They don’t live long, diseased as they are.
They are very remarkable; they will eat salt
by basons-full, and drink a great quantity of
water after. I have frequently known those
who could not have been hungry eat cabbage-leaves
and other refuse from the ash-heap.”</p>

<p>It is necessary that I should thus briefly
allude to this matter, as there is no doubt that
some of these people, making their way to
London, soon became street-sellers there, and
many of them took to the business subsequently,
when there was no employment in
harvesting, hop-picking, &amp;c. Of the poor
wretches landed at Liverpool, many (Mr.
Rushton states) became beggars, and many
thieves. Many, there is no doubt, tramped
their way to London, sleeping at the “casual
wards” of the Unions on their way; but I believe
that of those who had become habituated to the
practice of beggary or theft, few or none would
follow the occupation of street-selling, as even
the half-passive industry of such a calling
would be irksome to the apathetic and dishonest.</p>

<p>Of the immigration, direct by the vessels
trading from Ireland to London, there are no
returns such has have been collected by Mr.
Rushton for Liverpool, but the influx is comparatively
small, on account of the greater
length and cost of the voyage. During
the last year I am informed that 15,000 or
16,000 passengers were brought from Ireland
to London direct, and, in addition to these, 500
more were brought over from Cork in connection
with the arrangements for emigration to the
United States, and consigned to the emigration
agent here. Of the 15,500 (taking the mean
between the two numbers above given) 1,000
emigrated to the United States. It appears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on the authority of Mr. Rushton, that even in
the great year of the immigration, more than one-sixth
of the passengers from Ireland to Dublin
came on business. It may, then, be reasonable
to calculate that during last year one-fourth at
least of the passengers to London had the same
object in view, leaving about 10,000 persons
who have either emigrated to British North
America, Australia, &amp;c., or have resorted to
some mode of subsistence in the metropolis or
the adjacent parts. Besides these there are the
numbers who make their way up to London,
tramping it from the several provincial ports&mdash;namely,
Liverpool, Bristol, Newport, and Glasgow.
Of these I have no means of forming any
estimate, or of the proportion who adopt street-selling
on their arrival here&mdash;all that can be said
is, that the influx of Irish into the street-trade
every year must be very considerable. I believe,
however, that only those who “have friends in
the line” resort to street-selling on their arrival
in London, though all may make it a resource
when other endeavours fail. The great immigration
into London is from Cork, the average
cost of a deck passage being 5<i>s.</i> The immigrants
direct to London from Cork are rarely
of the poorest class.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Diet, Drink, and Expense Of
Living of the Street-Irish.</span></h3>

<p>The diet of the Irish men, women, and children,
who obtain a livelihood (or what is so designated)
by street-sale in London, has, I am told, on good
authority, experienced a change. In the lodging-houses
that they resorted to, their breakfast,
two or three years ago, was a dish of potatoes&mdash;two,
three, or four lbs., or more, in weight&mdash;for a
family. Now half an ounce of coffee (half chicory)
costs &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and that, with the half or quarter
of a loaf, according to the number in family, is
almost always their breakfast at the present time.
When their constant diet was potatoes, there
were frequent squabbles at the lodging-houses&mdash;to
which many of the poor Irish on their
first arrival resort&mdash;as to whether the potato-pot
or the tea-kettle should have the preference
on the fire. A man of superior intelligence,
who had been driven to sleep and eat
occasionally in lodging-houses, told me of some
dialogues he had heard on these occasions:&mdash;“It’s
about three years ago,” he said, “since I
heard a bitter old Englishwoman say, ‘To &mdash;&mdash; with
your ’taty-pot; they’re only meat for pigs.’
‘Sure, thin,’ said a young Irishman&mdash;he was
a nice ’cute fellow&mdash;‘sure, thin, ma’am, I
should be afther offering you a taste.’ I heard
that myself, sir. You may have noticed, that
when an Irishman doesn’t get out of temper, he
never loses his politeness, or rather his blarney.”</p>

<p>The dinner, or second meal of the day&mdash;assuming
that there has been a breakfast&mdash;ordinarily
consists of cheap fish and potatoes.
Of the diet of the poor street-Irish I had
an account from a little Irishman, then keeping
an oyster-stall, though he generally sold
fruit. In all such details I have found the
Irish far more communicative than the English.
Many a poor untaught Englishman will shrink
from speaking of his spare diet, and his trouble
to procure that; a reserve, too, much more
noticeable among the men than the women.
My Irish informant told me he usually had his
breakfast at a lodging-house&mdash;he preferred a
lodging-house, he said, on account of the
warmth and the society. Here he boiled half
an ounce of coffee, costing a &frac12;<i>d.</i> He purchased
of his landlady the fourth of a quartern
loaf (1&frac14;<i>d.</i> or 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>), for she generally cut a
quartern loaf into four for her single men
lodgers, such as himself, clearing sometimes a
farthing or two thereby. For dinner, my
informant boiled at the lodging-house two or
three lbs. of potatoes, costing usually 1<i>d.</i> or 1&frac14;<i>d.</i>,
and fried three, or four herrings, or as many
as cost a penny. He sometimes mashed his
potatoes, and spread over them the herrings, the
fatty portion of which flavoured the potatoes,
which were further flavoured by the roes of the
herrings being crushed into them. He drank
water to this meal, and the cost of the whole
was 2<i>d.</i> or 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> A neighbouring stall-keeper
attended to this man’s stock in his absence at
dinner, and my informant did the same for
him in his turn. For “tea” he expended 1<i>d.</i>
on coffee, or 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> on tea, being a “cup” of
tea, or “half-pint of coffee,” at a coffee-shop.
Sometimes he had a halfpenny-worth of butter,
and with his tea he ate the bread he had saved
from his breakfast, and which he had carried in
his pocket. He had no butter to his breakfast,
he said, for he could not buy less than a pennyworth
about where he lodged, and this was too
dear for one meal. On a Sunday morning however
he generally had butter, sometimes joining
with a fellow-lodger for a pennyworth; for his
Sunday dinner he had a piece of meat, which
cost him 2<i>d.</i> on the Saturday night. Supper
he dispensed with, but if he felt much tired
he had a half-pint of beer, which was three
farthings “in his own jug,” before he went to
bed, about nine or ten, as he did little or
nothing late at night, except on Saturday.
He thus spent 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day for food, and reckoning
2&frac12;<i>d.</i> extra for somewhat better fare on a
Sunday, his board was 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> a week. His
earnings he computed at 5<i>s.</i>, and thus he had
2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> weekly for other expenses. Of these
there was 1<i>s.</i> for lodging; 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> for
washing (but this not every week); &frac12;<i>d.</i> for a
Sunday morning’s shave; 1<i>d.</i> “for his religion”
(as he worded it); and 6<i>d.</i> for “odds
and ends,” such as thread to mend his clothes,
a piece of leather to patch his shoes, worsted
to darn his stockings, &amp;c. He was subject to
rheumatism, or “he might have saved a trifle
of money.” Judging by his methodical habits,
it was probable he had done so. He had
nothing of the eloquence of his countrymen,
and seemed indeed of rather a morose turn.</p>

<p>A family boarding together live even cheaper
than this man, for more potatoes and less fish
fall to the share of the children. A meal too is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
not unfrequently saved in this manner:&mdash;If
a man, his wife, and two children, all go
out in the streets selling, they breakfast before
starting, and perhaps agree to re-assemble at
four o’clock. Then the wife prepares the dinner
of fish and potatoes, and so tea is dispensed with.
In that case the husband’s and wife’s board
would be 4<i>d.</i> or 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day each, the children’s
3<i>d.</i> or 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> each, and giving 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> extra to each
for Sunday, the weekly cost is 10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> Supposing
the husband and wife cleared 5<i>s.</i> a week
each, and the children each 3<i>s.</i>, their earnings
would be 16<i>s.</i> The balance is the surplus left
to pay rent, washing, firing, and clothing.</p>

<p>From what I can ascertain, the Irish street-seller
can always live at about half the cost
of the English costermonger; the Englishman
must have butter for his bread, and meat at no
long intervals, for he “hates fish more than
once a week.” It is by this spareness of
living, as well as by frequently importunate
and mendacious begging, that the street-Irish
manage to save money.</p>

<p>The diet I have spoken of is <i>generally</i>, but
not universally, that of the poor street-Irish;
those who live differently, do not, as a rule,
incur greater expense.</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascertain in what proportion
the Irish street-sellers consume strong drink,
when compared with the consumption of the
English costers; as a poor Irishman, if questioned
on that or any subject, will far more
frequently shape his reply to what he thinks will
please his querist and induce a trifle for himself,
than answer according to the truth. The landlord
of a large public-house, after inquiring of
his assistants, that his opinions might be checked
by theirs, told me that in one respect there was
a marked difference between the beer-drinking
of the two people. He considered that in the
poor streets near his house there were residing
quite as many Irish street-sellers and labourers
as English, but the instances in which the Irish
conveyed beer to their own rooms, as a portion
of their meals, was not as 1 in 20 compared
with the English: “I have read your work,
sir,” he said, “and I know that you are quite
right in saying that the costermongers go for a
good Sunday dinner. I don’t know what my
customers are except by their appearance, but I
do know that many are costermongers, and by the
best of all proofs, for I have bought fish, fruit,
and vegetables of them. Well, now, we’ll take
a fine Sunday in spring or summer, when times
are pretty good with them; and, perhaps, in the
ten minutes after my doors are opened at one on
the Sunday, there are 100 customers for their
dinner-beer. Nearly three-quarters of these are
working men and their wives, working either in
the streets, or at their indoor trades, such as
tailoring. But among the number, I’m satisfied,
there are not more than two Irishmen.
There may be three or four Irishwomen, but one
of my barmen tells me he knows that two of
them&mdash;very well-behaved and good-looking
women&mdash;are married to Englishmen. In my
opinion the proportion, as to Sunday dinner-beer,
between English and Irish, may be two
or three in 70.”</p>

<p>An Irish gentleman and his wife, who are
both well acquainted with the habits and condition
of the people in their own country, informed
me, that among the classes who,
though earning only scant incomes, could
not well be called “impoverished,” the use
of beer, or even of small ale&mdash;known, now
or recently&mdash;as “Thunder’s thruppeny,” was
very unfrequent. Even in many “independent”
families, only water is drunk at dinner,
with punch to follow. This shows the
accuracy of the information I derived from
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (the innkeeper), for persons unused to
the drinking of malt liquor in their own country
are not likely to resort to it afterwards,
when their means are limited. I was further
informed, that reckoning the teetotallers among
the English street-sellers at 300, there are 600
among the Irish,&mdash;teetotallers too, who, having
taken the pledge, under the sanction of their
priests, and looking upon it as a religious obligation,
keep it rigidly.</p>

<p>The Irish street-sellers who frequent the gin-palaces
or public-houses, drink a pot of beer, in
a company of three or four, but far more frequently,
a quartern of gin (very seldom whisky)
oftener than do the English. Indeed, from all
I could ascertain, the Irish street-sellers, whether
from inferior earnings, their early training,
or the restraints of their priests, drink less beer,
by one-fourth, than their English brethren, but
a larger proportion of gin. “And you must bear
this in mind, sir,” I was told by an innkeeper,
“I had rather have twenty poor Englishmen
drunk in my tap-room than a couple of poor
Irishmen. They’ll quarrel with anybody&mdash;the
Irish will&mdash;and sometimes clear the room
by swearing they’ll ‘use their knives, by Jasus;’
and if there’s a scuffle they’ll kick like devils,
and scratch, and bite, like women or cats, instead
of using their fists. I wish all the drunkards
were teetotallers, if it were only to be rid
of them.”</p>

<p>Whiskey, I was told, would be drunk by the
Irish, in preference to gin, were it not that gin
was about half the price. One old Irish fruit-seller&mdash;who
admitted that he was fond of a
glass of gin&mdash;told me that he had not tasted
whiskey for fourteen years, “becase of the
price.” The Irish, moreover, as I have shown,
live on stronger and coarser food than the
English, buying all the rough (bad) fish, for, to
use the words of one of my informants, they
look to quantity more than quality; this may
account for their preferring a stronger and fiercer
stimulant by way of drink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Resources of the Street-Irish
as regards “Stock-Money,” Sickness,
Burials, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>It is not easy to ascertain from the poor Irish
themselves how they raise their stock-money,
for their command of money is a subject on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which they are not communicative, or, if communicative,
not truthful. “My opinion is,”
said an Irish gentleman to me, “that some of
these poor fellows would declare to God that
they hadn’t the value of a halfpenny, even if
you heard the silver chink in their pockets.”
It is certain that they never, or very rarely,
borrow of the usurers like their English
brethren.</p>

<p>The more usual custom is, that if a poor Irish
street-seller be in want of 5<i>s.</i>, it is lent to him
by the more prosperous people of his court&mdash;bricklayers’
labourers, or other working-men&mdash;who
club 1<i>s.</i> a piece. This is always repaid.
An Irish bricklayer, when in full work, will
trust a needy countryman with some article to
pledge, on the understanding that it is to be
redeemed and returned when the borrower is
able. Sometimes, if a poor Irishwoman need 1<i>s.</i>
to buy oranges, four others&mdash;only less poor than
herself, because not utterly penniless&mdash;will
readily advance 3<i>d.</i> each. Money is also advanced
to the deserving Irish through the
agency of the Roman Catholic priests, who are
the medium through whom charitable persons
of their own faith exercise good offices. Money,
too, there is no doubt, is often advanced out of
the priest’s own pocket.</p>

<p>On all the kinds of loans with which the poor
Irish are aided by their countrymen no interest
is ever charged. “I don’t like the Irish,”
said an English costermonger to me; “but they
<i>do</i> stick to one another far more than we do.”</p>

<p>The Irish costers hire barrows and shallows
like the English, but, if they “get on” at
all, they will possess themselves of their own
vehicles much sooner than an English costermonger.
A quick-witted Irishman will begin
to ponder on his paying 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for
the hire of a barrow worth 20<i>s.</i>, and he will
save and hoard until a pound is at his command
to purchase one for himself; while an
obtuse English coster (who will yet buy cheaper
than an Irishman) will probably pride himself
on his cleverness in having got the charge for
his barrow reduced, in the third year of its hire,
to 1<i>s.</i> a week the twelvemonth round!</p>

<p>In cases of sickness the mode of relief
adopted is similar to that of the English. A
raffle is got up for the benefit of the Irish
sufferer, and, if it be a bad case, the subscribers
pay their money without caring what trifle they
throw for, or whether they throw at all. If
sickness continue and such means as raffles
cannot be persevered in, there is one resource
from which a poor Irishman never shrinks&mdash;the
parish. He will apply for and accept parochial
relief without the least sense of shame,
a sense which rarely deserts an Englishman
who has been reared apart from paupers.
The English costers appear to have a
horror of the Union. If the Irishman be
taken into the workhouse, his friends do not
lose sight of him. In case of his death, they
apply for, and generally receive his body,
from the parochial authorities, undertaking the
expence of the funeral, when the body is duly
“waked.” “I think there’s a family contract
among the Irish,” said a costermonger to me;
“that’s where it is.”</p>

<p>The Irish street-folk are, generally speaking,
a far more provident body of people than the
English street-sellers. To save, the Irish will
often sacrifice what many Englishmen consider
a necessary, and undergo many a hardship.</p>

<p>From all I could ascertain, the saving of
an Irish street-seller does not arise from any
wish to establish himself more prosperously in
his business, but for the attainment of some
cherished project, such as emigration. Some
of the objects, however, for which these struggling
men hoard money, are of the most praiseworthy
character. They will treasure up halfpenny
after halfpenny, and continue to do so
for years, in order to send money to enable their
wives and children, and even their brothers and
sisters, when in the depth of distress in Ireland,
to take shipping for England. They will save
to be able to remit money for the relief of their
aged parents in Ireland. They will save to
defray the expense of their marriage, an expense
the English costermonger so frequently dispenses
with&mdash;but they will <i>not</i> save to preserve either
themselves or their children from the degradation
of a workhouse; indeed they often,
with the means of independence secreted on
their persons, apply for parish relief, and that
principally to save the expenditure of their
own money. Even when detected in such an
attempt at extortion an Irishman betrays no
passion, and hardly manifests any emotion&mdash;he
has speculated and failed. Not one of them
but has a positive genius for begging&mdash;both the
taste and the faculty for alms-seeking developed
to an extraordinary extent.</p>

<p>Of the amount “saved” by the patience of
the poor Irishmen, I can form no conjecture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the History of some Irish street-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>In order that the following statements might be
as truthful as possible, I obtained permission to
use the name of a Roman Catholic clergyman,
to whom I am indebted for much valuable
information touching this part of my subject.</p>

<p>A young woman, of whose age it was not easy
to form a conjecture, her features were so embrowned
by exposure to the weather, and perhaps
when I saw her a little swollen from cold,
gave me the following account as to her living.
Her tone and manner betrayed indifference to
the future, caused perhaps by ignorance,&mdash;for
uneducated persons I find are apt to look on
the future as if it must needs be but a repetition
of the present, while the past in many
instances is little more than a blank to them.
This young woman said, her brogue being little
perceptible, though she spoke thickly:</p>

<p>“I live by keepin’ this fruit stall. It’s a poor
livin’ when I see how others live. Yes, in
thruth, sir, but it’s thankful I am for to be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to live at all, at all; troth is it, in these sore times.
My father and mother are both did. God be
gracious to their sowls! They was evicted. The
family of us was. The thatch of the bit o’ home
was tuk off above our hids, and we were lift to the
wide worruld&mdash;yis, indeed, sir, and in the open
air too. The rint wasn’t paid and it couldn’t be
paid, and so we had to face the wither. It was
a sorrowful time. But God was good, and so
was the neighbours. And when we saw the
praste, he was a frind to us. And we came to
this counthry, though I’d always heard it called
a black counthry. Sure, an’ there’s much in it
to indhure. There’s goin’s on it, sir, that the
praste, God rewarrud him! wouldn’t like to see.
There’s bad ways. I won’t talk about thim,
and I’m sure you are too much of a gintlemin
to ask me; for if you know Father &mdash;&mdash;, that
shows you are the best of gintlemin, sure. It
was the eviction that brought us here. I don’t
know about where we was just; not in what
county; nor parish. I was so young whin we
lift the land. I belave I’m now 19, perhaps
only 18” (she certainly looked much older,
but I have often noticed that of her class). “I
can’t be more, I think, for sure an’ its only
5 or 6 years since we left Watherford and come
to Bristol. I’m sure it was Watherford, and a
beautiful place it is, and I know it was Bristol
we come to. We walked all the long way to
London. My parints died of the cholera, and
I live with mysilf, but my aunt lodges me and
sees to me. She sills in the sthreets too. I
don’t make 7<i>d.</i> a day. I may make 6<i>d.</i> There’s
a good many young payple I know is now
sillin’ in the streets becase they was evicted
in their own counthry. I suppose they had no
where ilse to come to. I’m nivir out of a night.
I sleep with my aunt, and we keep to oursilves
sure. I very sildom taste mate, but perhaps
I do oftener than before we was evicted&mdash;glory
be to God.”</p>

<p>One Irish street-seller I saw informed me
that she was a “widdy wid three childer.”
Her husband died about four years since.
She had then five children, and was near her
confinement with another. Since the death of
her husband she had lost three of her children;
a boy about twelve years died of stoppage on
his lungs, brought on, she said, through being
in the streets, and shouting so loud “to get sale
of the fruit.” She has been in Clare-street,
Clare-market, seven years with a fruit stall.
In the summer she sells green fruit, which she
purchases at Covent-garden. When the nuts,
oranges, &amp;c., come in season, she furnishes
her stall with that kind of fruit, and continues
to sell them until the spring salad comes in.
During the spring and summer her weekly
average income is about 5<i>s.</i>, but the remaining
portion of the year her income is not more
than 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, so that taking the year
through, her average weekly income is about
4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; out of this she pays 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week rent,
leaving only 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a week to find necessary
comforts for herself and family. For fuel the
children go to the market and gather up the
waste walnuts, bring them home and dry them,
and these, with a pennyworth of coal and coke,
serve to warm their chilled feet and hands. They
have no bedstead, but in one corner of a room is
a flock bed upon the floor, with an old sheet,
blanket, and quilt to cover them at this inclement
season. There is neither chair nor table;
a stool serves for the chair, and two pieces of
board upon some baskets do duty for a table,
and an old penny tea-canister for a candlestick.
She had parted with every article of furniture
to get food for her family. She received nothing
from the parish, but depended upon the sale of
her fruit for her living.</p>

<p>The Irishmen who are in this trade are also
very poor; and I learned that both Irishmen
and Irishwomen left the occupation now and
then, and took to begging, as a more profitable
calling, often going begging this month and
fruit-selling the next. This is one of the
causes which prompt the London costermongers’
dislike of the Irish. “They’ll beg themselves
into a meal, and work us out of one,”
said an English coster to me. Some of them
are, however, less “poverty-struck” (a word
in common use among the costermongers);
but these for the most part are men who have
been in the trade for some years, and have got
regular “pitches.”</p>

<p>The woman who gave me the following statement
seemed about twenty-two or twenty-three.
She was large-boned, and of heavy figure and
deportment. Her complexion and features were
both coarse, but her voice had a softness, even in
its broadest brogue, which is not very frequent
among poor Irishwomen. The first sentence she
uttered seems to me tersely to embody a deplorable
history of the poverty of a day. It was
between six and seven in the evening when I
saw the poor <span class="lock">creature:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sure, thin, sir, it’s thrippince I’ve taken to-day,
and tuppince is to pay for my night’s lodgin’.
I shall do no more good to-night, and shall
only stay in the cowld, if I stay in it, for nothing.
I’m an orphand, sir,” (she three or four times
alluded to this circumstance,) “and there’s nobody
to care for me but God, glory be to his
name! I came to London to join my brother,
that had come over and did will, and he sint for
me, but whin I got here I couldn’t find him in
it anyhow. I don’t know how long that’s ago.
It may be five years; it may be tin; but” (she
added, with the true eloquence of beggary,)
“sure, thin, sir, I had no harrut to keep count,
if I knew how. My father and mother wasn’t
able to keep me, nor to keep thimsilves in
Ireland, and so I was sint over here. They was
counthry payple. I don’t know about their
landlorrud. They died not long afther I came
here. I don’t know what they died of, but sure
it was of the will of God, and they hadn’t much
to make them love this worruld; no more have
I. Would I like to go back to my own counthry?
Will, thin, what would be the use? I sleep
at a lodging-house, and it’s a dacint place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
It’s mostly my own counthrywomen that’s in it;
that is, in the women’s part. I pay 1<i>s.</i> a week,
that’s 2<i>d.</i> a night, for I’m not charged for Sundays.
I live on brid, and ’taties and salt, and a
herrin’ sometimes. I niver taste beer, and not
often tay, but I sit here all day, and I feel the
hunger this day and that day. It goes off though,
if I have nothin’ to ate. I don’t know why, but
I won’t deny the goodness of God to bring such
a thing about. I have lived for a day on a pinny,
sir: a ha’pinny for brid, and a ha’pinny for a

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Irish “Refuse”-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>There still remains to be described one branch
of the Irish street-trade which is peculiar to the
class&mdash;viz., the sale of “refuse,” or such fruit
and vegetables as are damaged, and suited only
to the very poorest purchasers.</p>

<p>In assorting his goods, a fruit-salesman in
the markets generally throws to one side the
shrivelled, dwarfish, or damaged fruit&mdash;called
by the street-traders the “specks.” If the
supply to the markets be large, as in the pride
of the season, he will put his several kinds of
specks in separate baskets. At other times
all kinds are tossed together, and sometimes
with an admixture of nuts and walnuts. The
Irish women purchase these at a quarter, or
within a quarter, of the regular price, paying
from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a bushel for apples; 9<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for pears; 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for plums.
They are then sorted into halfpenny-worths for
sale on the stalls. Among the refuse is always
a portion of what is called “tidy” fruit, and this
occupies the prominent place in the “halfpenny
lots”&mdash;for they are usually sold at a halfpenny.
Sometimes, too, a salesman will throw in among
the refuse a little good fruit, if he happen to
have it over, either gratuitously or at the refuse
price; and this, of course, is always made the
most conspicuous on the stalls. Of other fruits,
perhaps, only a small portion is damaged, from
over-ripeness, or by the aggression of wasps and
insects, the remainder being very fine, so that
the retail “lots” are generally cheap. The
sellers aim at “half profits,” or cent. per cent.</p>

<p>The “refuse” trade in fruit&mdash;and the refuse-trade
is mainly confined to fruit&mdash;is principally
in the hands of the Irish. The persons carrying
it on are nearly all middle-aged and elderly
women. I once or twice saw a delicate and
pretty-looking girl sitting with the old “refuse”
women; but I found that she was not
a “regular hand,” and only now and then
“minded the stall” in her mother’s absence.
She worked with her needle, I was told.</p>

<p>Of the women who confine themselves to
this trade there are never less than twenty,
and frequently thirty. Sometimes, when the
refuse is very cheap and very abundant, as
many as 100 fruit-sellers, women and girls, will
sell it in halfpenny-worths, along with better
articles. These women also sell refuse dry-fruit,
purchased in Duke’s-place, but only
when they cannot obtain green-fruit, or cannot
obtain it sufficiently. All is sold at stalls; as
these dealers seem to think that if it were
hawked, the police might look too inquisitively
at a barrow stocked with refuse. The “refuse-sellers”
buy at all the markets. The poorer
street-sellers, whose more staple trade is in
oranges or nuts, are <i>occasional</i> dealers in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the regular refuse-buyers are not
among the <i>very</i> poorest class, as their sale is
tolerably quick and certain, but with the usual
drawbacks of wet weather. They make, I
was told, from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a day the year round,
or perhaps 7<i>d.</i> or 8<i>d.</i> a day, Sunday included.
They are all Roman Catholics, and resort
to the street-sale after mass. They are mostly
widows, or women who have reached middle-age,
unmarried. Some are the wives of
street-sellers. Two of their best pitches are
on Saffron-hill and in Petticoat-lane. It is
somewhat curious to witness these women
sitting in a line of five or six, and notwithstanding
their natural garrulity, hardly exchanging
a word one with another. Some of
them derive an evident solace from deliberate
puffs at a short black pipe.</p>

<p>A stout, healthy-looking woman of this class
said:&mdash;“Sure thin, sir, I’ve sat and sould my
bit of fruit in this place, or near it, for twinty
year and more, as is very well known indeed,
is it. I could make twice the money twinty
year ago that I can now, for the boys had the
ha’pinnies more thin than they has now, more’s
the pity. The childer is my custhomers, very
few beyant&mdash;such as has only a ha’pinny now
and thin, God hilp them. They’ll come a mile
from any parrut, to spind it with such as me, for
they know it’s chape we sill! Yis, indeed, or
they’ll come with a fardin either, for it’s a
ha’pinny lot we’ll split for them any time. The
boys buys most, but they’re dridful tazes. It’s
the patience of the divil must be had to dale
wid the likes of thim. They was dridful about
the Pope, but they’ve tired of it now. O, no,
it wasn’t the boys of my counthry that demaned
themselves that way. Well, I make
4<i>d.</i> some days, and 6<i>d.</i> some, and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> some,
and I have made 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and I have made
nothing. Perhaps I make 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> a week
rigular, but I’m established and well-known
you see.”</p>

<p>The quantity of refuse at the metropolitan
“green” markets varies with the different descriptions
of fruit. Of apples it averages one-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>twentieth,
and of plums and greengages one-fifteenth,
of the entire supply. With pears,
cherries, gooseberries, and currants, however,
the damaged amounts to one-twelfth, while of
strawberries and mulberries it reaches as high
as one-tenth of the aggregate quantity sent to
market.</p>

<p>The Irish street-sellers, I am informed, buy
full two-thirds of all the refuse, the other third
being purchased by the lower class of English
costermongers&mdash;“the illegitimates,”&mdash;as they
are called. We must not consider the sale of
the damaged fruit so great an evil as it would,
at the first blush, appear, for it constitutes perhaps
the sole luxury of poor children, as well
as of the poor themselves, who, were it not for
the halfpenny and farthing lots of the refuse-sellers,
would doubtlessly never know the taste
of such things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject, it may
be as well to say a few words concerning the
curious revelations made by the returns from
Billingsgate, Covent-garden, and the other London
markets, as to the diet of the poor. In the
first place, then, it appears that in the matter
of fish, herrings constitute the chief article
of consumption&mdash;no less than 210,000,000 lbs.
weight of this fish in a “fresh” state, and
60,000,000 lbs. in a “dried” state, being annually
eaten by the humbler classes of the
metropolis and the suburbs. Of sprats there
are 3,000,000 lbs. weight consumed&mdash;and these,
with the addition of plaice, are the staple
comestibles at the dinners and suppers of the
ichthyophagous part of the labouring population
of London. One of the reasons for this
is doubtless the extraordinary cheapness of
these kinds of fish. The sprats are sold at a
penny per pound; the herrings at the same
rate; and the plaice at a fraction less, perhaps;
whereas a pound of butcher’s meat, even
“pieces,” or the “block ornaments,” as they are
sometimes called, cannot be got for less than
twopence-halfpenny or threepence. But the
relative cheapness of these two kinds of food
can only be tested by the proportionate quantity
of nutrition in each. According to Liebig,
butcher’s meat contains 26 per cent. of solid
matter, and 74 per cent. of water; whereas, according
to Brande, fish consists of 20 parts of
solid matter, and 80 parts water in every 100.
Hence it would appear that butcher’s meat
is five per cent. more nutritive than fish&mdash;or,
in other words, that if the two were equally
cheap, the prices, according to the quantity of
nutrition in each, should be for fish one penny
per pound, and butcher’s meat not five farthings;
so that even at twopence-halfpenny the pound,
meat is more than twice as dear an article of diet
as fish.</p>

<p>But it is not only on account of their cheapness
that herrings and sprats are consumed in
such vast quantities by the labouring people of
London. Salmon, eels, herrings, pilchards, and
sprats, Dr. Pereira tells us, abound in oil; and
oleaginous food, according to Leibig, is an
“element of respiration,” consisting of nearly
80 per cent. charcoal, which burns away in the
lungs, and so contributes to the warmth of
the system. Fat, indeed, may be said to act as
fuel to the vital fire; and we now know, from
observations made upon the average daily consumption
of food by 28 soldiers of the Grand
Duke of Hesse Darmstadt, in barracks, for a
month&mdash;which is the same as 840 men for one
day&mdash;that an adult taking moderate exercise
consumes, in the act of respiration, very nearly
a pound of charcoal every day, which of course
must be supplied in his food. “But persons
who take much exercise, or labour hard,” says
Dr. Pereira, “require more frequent and copious
meals than the indolent or sedentary. In
the active man the number of respirations is
greater than in the inactive, and therefore a
more frequent supply of food is required to
furnish the increased quantity of carbon and
hydrogen to be consumed in the lungs.” “A
bird deprived of food,” says Liebig, “dies on
the third day; while a serpent, with its sluggish
respiration, can live without food three months,
or longer.”</p>

<p>Captain Parry, in his account of one of the
Polar expeditions (1827), states, that both himself
and Mr. Beverley, the surgeon, were of
opinion, that, in order to maintain the strength
of the men during their harassing journey across
the ice, living constantly in the open air, and
exposed to the wet and cold for twelve hours a
day, an addition was requisite of at least one-third
to the quantity of provisions daily issued.
So, in the gaol dietaries, the allowance to prisoners
sentenced to hard labour for three months is
one-third more than the scale for those sentenced
to hard labour for three days&mdash;the former having
254 ounces, and the latter only 168 ounces
of solid food served out to them every week.</p>

<p>But the hard-working poor not only require
more food than the non-working rich, but it is
mainly because the rich are better fed that they
are more lethargic than the poor; for the greater
the supply of nutriment to the body, the more
inactive does the system become. From experiments
made a few years ago at the Zoological
Gardens, it was found, that, by feeding the animals
twice, instead of once, in the twenty-four
hours, their habits, as regards exercise, were
altered&mdash;a fact which readily explains how the
fat and overfed are always the least energetic;
fat being at once the cause and consequence of
inaction. It is well to hear an obese citizen tell
a hollow-cheeked man, who begs a penny of
him, “to go and work&mdash;a lazy scoundrel;” but
physiology assures us that the fat tradesman
is naturally the laziest of the two. In a word,
he is fat because he is lazy, and lazy because he
is fat.</p>

<p>The industrious poor, however, not only require
more food than the indolent rich, but, getting
less, they become more susceptible of cold,
and, therefore, more eager for all that tends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
promote warmth. I have often had occasion to
remark the sacrifices that the ill-fed will make
to have “a bit of fire.” “He who is well
fed,” observes Sir John Ross, “resists cold
better than the man who is stinted, while starvation
from cold follows but too soon a starvation
in food. This doubtlessly explains in a great
measure the resisting powers of the natives of
frozen climates, their consumption of food being
enormous, and often incredible.” Captain
Cochrane, in his “Journey through Russia and
Siberian Tartary,” tells us that he has repeatedly
seen a Yakut or Tongouse devour forty pounds
of meat in a day; and one of the Yakuti he
speaks of as having consumed, in twenty-four
hours, “the hind-quarter of a large ox, twenty
pounds of fat, and a proportionate quantity of
melted butter for his drink.” (Vol. i. p. 255).
Much less heat is evolved, physiologists tell us,
where there is a deficiency of food. “During
the whole of our march,” says Sir John Franklin,
“we experienced that no quantity of clothing
could keep us warm while we fasted; but,
on those occasions on which we were enabled to
go to bed with full stomachs, we passed the
night in a warm and comfortable manner.”
Hence, it is evident, that in summer a smaller
quantity of food suffices to keep up the temperature
of the body. I know of no experiments to
show the different proportions of aliment required
at different seasons of the year. In
winter, however, when a greater supply is certainly
needed, the labouring man, unfortunately,
has less means of obtaining it&mdash;nearly all trades
slacken as the cold weather comes on, and
some, as brick-making, market-gardening, building,
&amp;c., then almost entirely cease&mdash;so that,
were it not for the cheapness of fish, and, moreover,
the oleaginous quality of those kinds which
are most plentiful in the winter time, the metropolitan
poor would be very likely to suffer that
“starvation from cold which,” in the words of
Sir John Ross, “follows but too soon a starvation
in food.” Hence we can readily understand
the remark of the enthusiastic street-seller&mdash;“Sprats
<i>is</i> a blessing to the poor.”</p>

<p>The returns as to the other articles of food
sold in the streets are equally curious. The
1,500,000<i>l.</i> spent yearly in fish, and the comparatively
small amount expended on vegetables,
viz., 290,000<i>l.</i>, is a circumstance which seems to
show that the labouring population of London
have a greater relish for animal than vegetable
diet. “It is quite certain,” says Dr. Carpenter,
“that the most perfect physical development
and the greatest intellectual vigour are to be
found among those races in which a mixed diet
of animal and vegetable food is the prevalent
habit.” And yet, in apparent contradiction
to the proposition asserted with so much confidence
by Dr. Carpenter, we have the following
curious fact cited by Mr. Jacob <span class="lock">Bentley:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is, indeed, a fact worthy of remark, and one
that seems never to have been noticed, that throughout
the whole animal creation, in every country and
clime of the earth the most useful animals cost nature
the least waste to sustain them with food. For instance,
all animals that work, live on vegetable or
fruit food; and no animal that eats flesh, works. The
all-powerful elephant, and the patient, untiring camel
in the torrid zone; the horse, the ox, or the donkey in
the temperate, and the rein-deer in the frigid zone;
obtain all their muscular power for enduring labour,
from Nature’s simplest productions,&mdash;the vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>“But all the flesh-eating animals, keep the rest of
the animated creation in constant dread of them.
They seldom eat vegetable food till some other animal
has eaten it first, and made it into flesh. Their only
use seems to be, to destroy life; their own flesh is
unfit for other animals to eat, having been itself made
out of flesh, and is most foul and offensive. Great
strength, fleetness of foot, usefulness, cleanliness and
docility, are then always characteristic of vegetable-eating
animals, while all the world dreads flesh-eaters.”</p></div>

<p>Of vegetables we have seen that the greatest
quantity consumed by the poor consists of
potatoes, of which 60,500,000 lbs. are annually
sold in the streets; but ten pounds of potatoes
are only equal in nutritive power to one pound of
butcher’s meat, which contains one-fifth more
solid food than fish,&mdash;so that a pound of fish
may be said to equal eight pounds of potatoes,
and thus the 60,000,000 lbs. of vegetable is
dietetically equivalent to nearly 7,000,000
lbs. of fish diet. The cost of the potatoes,
at five pounds for 2<i>d.</i>, is, as we have seen,
100,000<i>l.</i>; whereas the cost of the same amount
of nutritive matter in the form of fish, at 1<i>d.</i> per
pound, would have been only 30,000<i>l.</i>, or upwards
of two-thirds less. The vegetable of
which there is the next greatest street sale is
onions, upon which 90,000<i>l.</i> are annually expended.
This has been before accounted for,
by saying, that a piece of bread and an onion are
to the English labourer what bread and grapes
are to the Frenchman&mdash;oftentimes a meal. The
relish for onions by the poorer classes is not
difficult to explain. Onions are strongly stimulating
substances, and they owe their peculiar
odour and flavour, as well as their pungent and
stimulating qualities, to an acrid volatile oil
which contains sulphur. This oil becomes
absorbed, quickens the circulation, and occasions
thirst. The same result takes place with the
oil of fish. It not only proves a stimulant to
the general system, but we are told that the
thirst and uneasy feeling at the stomach, frequently
experienced after the use of the richer
species of fish, have led to the employment of
spirit to this kind of food. Hence, says Dr.
Pereira, the vulgar proverb, “Brandy is Latin
for Fish.” Moreover, the two classes of food
are similar in their comparative indigestibility,
for the uneducated palates of the poor not only
require a more pungent kind of diet, but their
stronger stomachs need something that will
resist the action of the gastric juice for a considerable
time. Hence their love of shell-fish.</p>

<p>The small quantity of fruit, too, sold to the
poor is a further proof of what is here stated.
The amount of the street sale of this luxury is
no criterion as to the quantity purchased by the
London labourers; for according to all accounts
the fruit-buyers in the streets consist mostly of
clerks, shopmen, small tradesmen, and the chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>dren
of mechanics or the lower grade of middle
class people. Those who may be said strictly
to belong to the poor,&mdash;viz. those whose incomes
are barely sufficient for their support&mdash;seldom
purchase fruit. In the first place they have
no money to spend on such a mere toothsome
extravagance; and, secondly, they require a
stronger and more stimulating, and “<i>staying</i>”
kind of food. The delights of the palate, we
should remember, are studied only when the
cravings of the stomach are satisfied, so that
those who have strong stomachs have necessarily
dull palates, and, therefore, prefer something
that “bites in the mouth,”&mdash;to use the words
of one of my informants&mdash;like gin, onions,
sprats, or pickled whelks. What the poor term
“relishes” are very different things from what
the rich style the “delicacies of the season.”</p>

<p>I have no means of ascertaining the average
number of ounces of solid food consumed by the
poorer class of the metropolis. The <i>whole</i> of
the fish, fruit, and vegetables, sold to the London
costermongers, is not disposed of in the London
streets&mdash;many of the street-sellers going, as we
have seen, country excursions with their goods.
According to the result of the Government
Commissioners of Inquiry, the labourers in the
country are unable to procure for themselves
and families an average allowance of more than
122 ounces of solid food&mdash;principally bread&mdash;every
week; hence it has been justly said we
may infer that the man consumes, as his
share, 140 ounces (134 bread and 6 meat).
The gaol dietaries allow 254 ounces, or nearly
twice as much to all prisoners, who undergo
continuous hard labour. In the construction of
these dietaries Sir James Graham&mdash;the then
Secretary of State&mdash;says, in his “Letter to the
Chairman of Quarter Sessions” (January 27th,
1843), “I have consulted not only the Prison
Inspectors, but medical men of the greatest
eminence possessing the advantage of long
experience.” They are proposed, he adds, “as
the <i>minimum</i> amount which can be safely
afforded to prisoners without the risk of inflicting
a punishment not contemplated by law and
which it is unjust and cruel to inflict; namely,
loss of health and strength through the inadequacy
of the food supplied.” Hence it appears
not that the thief gets too much, but the honest
working man too little&mdash;or, in other words, that
the labourer of this country is able to procure,
by his industry, only half the quantity of
food that is considered by “medical men of
the greatest eminence” to be “the <i>minimum</i>
amount” that can be <i>safely</i> afforded for the
support of the criminals&mdash;a fact which it would
be out of place to comment upon here.</p>

<p>One word concerning the incomes of the London
costermongers, and I have done. It has been
before shown that the gross sum of money <i>taken</i>
yearly, in the streets, by the sale of fish, fruit,
and vegetables, amounts, in round numbers,
to two million pounds&mdash;a million and a half
being expended in fish, and a quarter of a
million upon fruit and vegetables respectively.
In estimating the yearly receipts of the costermongers,
from their average gains, the gross
“takings” of the entire body were concluded to
be between a million and a quarter and a million
and a half sterling&mdash;that is to say, each one of
the 10,000 street-sellers of fish, fruit, and vegetables,
was supposed to clear ten shillings a
week all the year through, and to <i>take</i> fifty
shillings. But, according to the returns furnished
me by the salesmen, at the several metropolitan
markets, the weekly “<i>takings</i>” of the
ten thousand men and their families&mdash;for often
both wife and children sell&mdash;cannot be less than
four pounds per week all the year round, out
of which it would seem that the clear weekly
<i>gains</i> are about fifteen shillings. (Some costers
we have seen take pounds in a day, others&mdash;as
the nut and orange-women and children&mdash;only
a few shillings a week; some, again, make cent.
per cent. profit, whilst others are obliged to sell
at a loss.) This, from all I can gather, as well
as from a comparison of the coster’s style of
living with other classes whose weekly income
is nearly the same, appears to be very close
upon the truth.</p>

<p>We may then, I think, safely assert, that the
gross yearly receipts of the London costermongers
are two millions of money; that their
clear annual gain, or income, is 425,000<i>l.</i>; and
that the capital invested in their business, in
the form of donkey-carts, barrows, baskets,
weights, and stock-money, is 25,000<i>l.</i>;&mdash;half of
this being borrowed, for which they pay upwards
of 20,000<i>l.</i> interest per annum.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_GAME_POULTRY_LIVE_AND_DEAD_RABBITS_BUTTER_CHEESE_AND_EGGS"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF GAME, POULTRY (LIVE AND
DEAD), RABBITS, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The class who sell game and poultry in the
public thoroughfares of the metropolis are styled
hawkers, both in Leadenhall and Newgate-market.
The number of these dealers in London is
computed at between 200 and 300. Of course,
legally to sell game, a license, which costs 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>
yearly, is required; but the street-seller laughs
at the notion of being subjected to a direct tax;
which, indeed, it might be impossible to levy on
so “slippery” a class.</p>

<p>The sale of game, even with a license, was not
legalised until 1831; and, prior to that year, the
mere killing of game by an “unqualified” person
was an offence entailing heavy penalties.
The “qualification” consisted of the possession
of a freehold estate of 100<i>l.</i> a year, or a leasehold
for ninety-nine years of 150<i>l.</i> a year! By an
Act, passed in the 25th year of George III., it
was provided that a certificate (costing 3<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>) must be taken out by all qualified persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
killing game. Since 1831 (1 &amp; 2 William IV.,
c. 32,) a certificate, without any qualification, is
all that is required from the game-killer.</p>

<p>Both sexes carry on the trade in game-hawking,
but there are more than thrice as many men
as women engaged in the business, the weight
occasionally carried being beyond a woman’s
strength. The most customary dress of the game
or poultry-hawker is a clean smock-frock covering
the whole of his other attire, except the ends
of his trousers and his thick boots or shoes. Indeed
he often, but less frequently than was the
case five years ago, assumes the dress of a country
labourer, although he may have been for years
a resident in London. About forty years ago, I
am informed, it was the custom for countrymen,
residing at no great distance, to purchase a stock
of chickens or ducks; and, taking their places
in a wagon, to bring their birds to London,
and hawk them from door to door. Some of
these men’s smock-frocks were a convenient
garb, for they covered the ample pockets of the
coat beneath, in which were often a store of partridges,
or an occasional pheasant or hare. This
game, illegally killed&mdash;for it was all poached&mdash;was
illegally sold by the hawker, and illegally
bought by the hotel-keepers and the richer
tradesmen. One informant (an old man) was of
opinion that the game was rarely offered for sale
by these countrymen at the West-end mansions
of the aristocracy. “In fact,” he said, “I knew
one country fellow&mdash;though he was sharp enough
in his trade of game and poultry-selling&mdash;who
seemed to think that every fine house, without a
shop, and where there were livery servants, must
needs be inhabited by a magistrate! But, as
the great props of poaching were the rich&mdash;for,
of course, the poor couldn’t buy game&mdash;there
was, no doubt, a West-end as well as a City trade
in it. I have bought game of a country poultry-hawker,”
continued my informant, “when
I lived in the City at the beginning of this century,
and generally gave 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a brace for
partridges. I have bid it, and the man has left,
refusing to take it; and has told me afterwards,
and, I dare say, he spoke the truth, that he had
sold his partridges at 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> or more. I believe
5<i>s.</i> a brace was no uncommon price in the
City. I have given as much as 10<i>s.</i> for a pheasant
for a Christmas supper. The hawker, before
offering the birds for sale, used to peer about him,
though we were alone in my counting-house, and
then pull his partridges out of his pockets, and
say, ‘Sir, do you want any very young chickens?’&mdash;for
so he called them. Hares he called
‘lions;’ and they cost often, enough, 5<i>s.</i> each of
the hawker. The trade had all the charms and
recommendations of a mystery and a risk about
it, just like smuggling.”</p>

<p>The sale of game in London, however, was
not confined to the street-hawkers, who generally
derived their stock-in-trade immediately from
the poacher. Before the legalisation of the sale,
the trade was carried on, under the rose, by the
salesmen in Leadenhall-market, and that to an
extent of not less than a fifteenth of the sale now
accomplished there. The purveyors for the
London game-market&mdash;I learned from leading
salesmen in Leadenhall&mdash;were not then, as now,
noble lords and honourable gentlemen, but peasant
or farmer poachers, who carried on the
business systematically. The guards and coachmen
of the stage-coaches were the media of communication,
and had charge of the supply to the
London market. The purchasers of the game
thus supplied to a market, which is mostly the
property of the municipality of the City of London,
were not only hotel-keepers, who required
it for public dinners presided over by princes,
peers, and legislators, but the purveyors for the
civic banquets&mdash;such as the Lord Mayor’s ninth
of November dinner, at which the Ministers of
State always attended.</p>

<p>This street-hawking of <i>poached</i> game, as far
as I could ascertain from the best-informed
quarters, hardly survived the first year of the
legalised sale.</p>

<p>The female hawkers of game are almost all
the wives of the men so engaged, or are women
living with them as their wives. The trade is
better, as regards profit, than the costermonger’s
ordinary pursuits, but only when the season is
favourable; it is, however, more uncertain.</p>

<p>There is very rarely a distinction between the
hawkers of game and of poultry. A man will
carry both, or have game one day and poultry
the next, as suits his means, or as the market
avails. The street-sellers of cheese are generally
costers, while the vendors of butter and
eggs are almost extinct.</p>

<p>Game, I may mention, consists of grouse (including
black-cocks, and all the varieties of
heath or moor-game), partridges, pheasants,
bustards, and hares. Snipe, woodcocks, plovers,
teal, widgeons, wild ducks, and rabbits are not
game, but can only be taken or killed by certificated
persons, who are owners or occupiers of
the property on which they are found, or who
have the necessary permission from such persons
as are duly authorised to accord it. Poultry
consists of chickens, geese, ducks, and turkeys,
while some persons class pigeons as poultry.</p>

<p>Birds are dietetically divided into three classes:
(1) the white-fleshed, as the common fowl and
the turkey; (2) the dark-fleshed game, as the
grouse and the black-cock; and (3) the aquatic
(including swimmers and waders), as the goose
and the duck; the flesh of the latter is penetrated
with fat, and difficult of digestion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Quantity of Game, Rabbits, and
Poultry, sold in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>It appears from inquiries that I instituted, and
from authentic returns which I procured on the
subject, that the following is the quantity of
game and poultry sold yearly, as an average, in
the markets of the metropolis. I give it exclusive
of such birds as wild-ducks, woodcocks, &amp;c.,
the supply of which depends upon the severity
of the winter. I include all wild birds or animals,
whether considered game or not, and I use
round numbers, but as closely as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>During the past Christmas, however, I may
observe, that the supply of poultry to the
markets has been greater than on any previous
occasion. The immensity of the supply
was favourable to the hawker’s profit, as the
glut enabled him to purchase both cheaply and
largely. One young poultry-hawker told me
that he had cleared 3<i>l.</i> in the Christmas week,
and had spent it all in four days&mdash;except 5<i>s.</i>
reserved for stock-money. It was not spent
<i>entirely</i> in drunkenness, a large portion of it
being expended in treats and amusements. So
great, indeed, has been the supply of game and
poultry this year, that a stranger, unused to the
grand scale on which provisions are displayed
in the great metropolitan marts, on visiting
Leadenhall, a week before or after Christmas,
might have imagined that the staple food of the
London population consisted of turkeys, geese,
and chickens. I give, however, an <i>average</i>
yearly supply:</p>

<p>In the above return wild ducks and woodcocks
are not included, because the quantity sent to
London is dependent entirely upon the severity
of the winter. With the costers wild ducks are
a favourite article of trade, and in what those
street tradesmen would pronounce a favourable
season for wild ducks, which means a very
hard winter, the number sold in London will,
I am told, equal that of pheasants (64,000).
The great stock of wild ducks for the London
tables is from Holland, where the duck
decoys are objects of great care. Less than
a fifth of the importation from Holland is
from Lincolnshire. These birds, and even the
finest and largest, have been sold during a
glut at 1<i>s.</i> each. Woodcocks, under similar
circumstances, number with plovers (45,000),
nearly all of which are “golden plovers;” but
of woodcocks the costermongers buy very few:
“They’re only a mouthful and a half,” said
one of them, “and don’t suit our customers.”
In severe weather a few ptarmigan are sent to
London from Scotland, and in 1841-2 great
numbers were sent to the London markets from
Norway. One salesman received nearly 10,000
ptarmigan in one day. A portion of these were
disposed of to the costers, but the sale was not
such as to encourage further importations.</p>

<p>The returns I give show, that, at the two great
game and poultry-markets, 5,500,000 birds and
animals, wild and tame, are yearly sent to London.
To this must be added all that may be
consigned direct to metropolitan game-dealers
and poulterers, besides what may be sent as
presents from the country, &amp;c., so that the
London supply may be safely estimated, I am
assured, at 6,000,000.</p>

<p>It is difficult to arrive at any very precise
computation of the quantity of game and poultry
sold by the costers, or rather at the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
value (or price) of what they sell. The most
experienced salesmen agree, that, as to <i>quantity</i>,
including everything popularly considered
game (and I have so given it in the return),
they sell one-third. As regards <i>value</i>, however,
their purchases fall very short of a third.
Of the best qualities of game, and even more
especially of poultry, a third of the hawkers
may buy a fifteenth, compared with their purchases
in the lower-priced kinds. The others buy
none of the best qualities. The more “aristocratic”
of the poultry-hawkers will, as a rule,
only buy, “when they have an order” or a
sure sale, the best quality of English turkey-cocks;
which cannot be wondered at, seeing that
the average price of the English turkey-cock
is 12<i>s.</i> One salesman this year sold (at Leadenhall)
several turkey-cocks at 30<i>s.</i> each, and
one at 3<i>l.</i> The average price of an English
turkey-hen is 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and of these the costers
buy a few: but their chief trade is in foreign
turkey-hens; of which the average price (when
of good quality and in good condition) is 3<i>s.</i>
The foreign turkey-cocks average half the price
of the English (or 6<i>s.</i>). Of Dorking fat
chickens, which average 6<i>s.</i> the couple, the
hawkers buy none (save as in the case of the
turkey-cocks); but of the Irish fowls, which,
this season, have averaged 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the couple,
they buy largely. On the other hand they buy
nearly all the rabbits sent from Scotland, and
half of those sent from Ostend, while they
“clear the market”&mdash;no matter of what the
glut may consist&mdash;when there <i>is</i> a glut. There
is another distinction of which the hawker avails
himself. The average price of young plump
partridges is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the brace, of old partridges,
2<i>s.</i>; accordingly, the coster buys the old. It is
the same with pheasants, the young averaging
7<i>s.</i> the brace, the old 6<i>s.</i>: “And I can sell them
best,” said one man; “for my customers say
they’re more tastier-like. I’ve sold game for
twelve years, or more, but I never tasted any of
any kind, so I can’t say who’s right and who’s
wrong.”</p>

<p>The hawkers buy, also, game and poultry
which will not “keep” another day. Sometimes
they puff out the breast of a chicken with
fresh pork fat, which melts as the bird roasts.
“It freshens the fowl, I’ve been told, and improves
it,” said one man; “and the shopkeepers
now and then, does the same. It’s a improvement,
sir.”</p>

<p>In the present season the costers have bought
of wild ducks, comparatively, none, and of teal,
widgeons, wild birds, and larks, none at all; or
so sparely, as to require no notice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Purchasers of Game and
Poultry.</span></h3>

<p>As the purchasers of game and poultry are of
a different class to the costermongers’ ordinary
customers, I may devote a few words to them.
From all the information that I could acquire,
they appear to consist, principally, of those who
reside at a distance from any cheap market, and
buy a cheap luxury when it is brought to
their doors, as well as of those who are “always
on the look-out for something toothy, such as
the shabby genteels, as they’re called, who never
gives nothing but a scaly price. They’ve bargained
with me till I was hard held from pitching
into them, and over and over again I should,
only it would have been fourteen days anyhow.
They’ll tell me my birds stinks, when they’re as
sweet as flowers. They’d go to the devil to
save three farthings on a partridge.” Other
buyers are old gourmands, living perhaps on
small incomes, or if possessed of ample incomes,
but confining themselves to a small expenditure;
others, again, are men who like a cheap
dinner, and seldom enjoy it, at their own cost,
unless it be cheap, and who best of all like
“such a thing as a moor bird (grouse),” said
one hawker, “which can be eat up to a man’s
own cheek.” This was also the opinion of a
poulterer and game-dealer, who sometimes sold
“goods” to the hawkers. Of this class of “patrons”
many shopkeepers, in all branches of
business, have a perfect horror, as they will
care nothing for having occupied the tradesmen’s
time to no purpose.</p>

<p>The game and poultry street-sellers, I am
told, soon find out when a customer is bent
upon a bargain, and shape their prices accordingly.
Although these street-sellers may generally
take as their motto the announcement so
often seen in the shops of competitive tradesmen,
“no reasonable offer refused,” they are
sometimes so worried in bargaining that they <i>do</i>
refuse.</p>

<p>In a conversation I had with a “retired”
game salesman, he said it might be curious
to trace the history of a brace of birds&mdash;of
grouse, for instance&mdash;sold in the streets; and he
did it after this manner. They were shot in
the Highlands of Scotland by a member of
parliament who had gladly left the senate for
the moors. They were transferred to a tradesman
who lived in or near some Scotch town
having railway communication, and with whom
“the honourable gentleman,” or “the noble
lord,” had perhaps endeavoured to drive a hard
bargain. He (the senator) <i>must</i> have a good
price for his birds, as he had given a large sum
for the moor: and the season was a bad one:
the birds were scarce and wild: they would
soon be “packed” (be in flocks of twenty or
thirty instead of in broods), and then there
would be no touching a feather of them. The
canny Scot would quietly say that it was early
in the season, and the birds never packed so
early; that as to price, he could only give what
he could get from a London salesman, and
he was “nae just free to enter into any agreement
for a fixed price at a’.” The honourable
gentleman, after much demurring, gives
way, feeling perhaps that he cannot well do
anything else. In due course the grouse are
received in Leadenhall, and unpacked and
flung about with as little ceremony as if they
had been “slaughtered” by a Whitechapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
journeyman butcher, at so much a head. It
is a thin market, perhaps, when they come to
hand. A dealer, fashionable in the parish of
St. George, Hanover-square, has declined to
give the price demanded; they were not his
money; “he had to give such long credit.”
A dealer, popular in the ward of Cheap, has
also declined to buy, and for the same alleged
reason. The salesman, knowing that some of
these dealers <i>must</i> buy, quietly says that he
will take no less, and as he is known to be
a man of his word, little is said upon the
subject. As the hour arrives at which fashionable
game-dealers are compelled to buy, or
disappoint customers who will not brook such
disappointment, the market, perhaps, is glutted,
owing to a very great consignment by a later
railway train. The <i>Inverness Courier</i>, or the
<i>North of Scotland Gazette</i>, are in due course
quoted by the London papers, touching the
“extraordinary sport” of a party of lords and
gentlemen in the Highlands; and the “heads”
of game are particularized with a care that would
do honour to a <i>Price Current</i>. The salesman
then disposes rapidly of divers “brace” to the
“hawkers,” at 1<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> the brace, and the
hawker offers them to hotel-keepers, and shop-keepers,
and housekeepers, selling some at
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the brace, some at 3<i>s.</i>, at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, at 2<i>s.</i>,
and at less. “At last,” said my informant,
“he may sell the finest brace of his basket,
which he has held back to get a better price for,
at 6<i>d.</i> a-piece, rather than keep them over-night,
and that to a woman of the town, whom he may
have met reeling home with money in her
purse. Thus the products of an honourable
gentleman’s skilful industry, on which he
greatly prided himself, are eaten by the woman
and her ‘fancy man,’ grumblingly enough, for
they pronounce the birds inferior to tripe.”</p>

<p>The best quarters for the street-sale of game and
poultry are, I am informed from several sources,
either the business parts of the metropolis, or
else the houses in the several suburbs which are
the furthest from a market or from a business
part. The squares, crescents, places, and streets,
that do not partake of one or the other of these
characteristics, are pronounced “no good.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Game Hawker.</span></h3>

<p>The man who gave me the following information
was strong and robust, and had a weather-beaten
look. He seemed about fifty. He wore
when I saw him a large velveteen jacket, a cloth
waistcoat which had been once green, and brown
corduroy trousers. No part of his attire, though
it seemed old, was patched, his shirt being clean
and white. He evidently aimed at the gamekeeper
style of dress. He affected some humour,
and was dogged in his opinions:</p>

<p>“I was a gentleman’s footman when I was a
young man,” he said, “and saw life both in
town and country; so I knows what things
belongs.” [A common phrase among persons
of his class to denote their being men of the
world.] “I never liked the confinement of service,
and besides the upper servants takes on so.
The others puts up with it more than they would,
I suppose, because they hopes to be butlers
themselves in time. The only decent people in
the house I lived in last was master and missus.
I won 20<i>l.</i>, and got it too, on the Colonel,
when he won the Leger. Master was a bit of
a turf gentleman, and so we all dabbled&mdash;like
master like man, you know, sir. I think that
was in 1828, but I’m not certain. We came to
London not long after Doncaster” [he meant
Doncaster races], “something about a lawsuit,
and that winter I left service and bought the
goodwill of a coffee-shop for 25<i>l.</i> It didn’t
answer. I wasn’t up to the coffee-making, I
think; there’s a deal of things belongs to all
things; so I got out of it, and after that I was
in service again, and then I was a boots at an
inn. But I couldn’t settle to nothing long; I’m
of a free spirit, you see. I was hard up at last,
and I popped my watch for a sovereign, because
a friend of mine&mdash;we sometimes drank together
of a night&mdash;said he could put me in the pigeon
and chicken line; that was what he called it, but
it meant game. This just suited me, for I’d been
out with the poachers when I was a lad, and
indeed when I was in service, out of a night on
the sly; so I knew they got stiffish prices. My
friend got me the pigeons. I believe he cheated
me, but he’s gone to glory. The next season
game was made legal eating. Before that I
cleared from 25<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i> a week by selling my
‘pigeons.’ I carried real pigeons as well, which
I said was my own rearing at Gravesend. I sold
my game pigeons&mdash;there was all sorts of names
for them&mdash;in the City, and sometimes in the
Strand, or Charing-cross, or Covent-garden. I
sold to shopkeepers. Oft enough I’ve been offered
so much tea for a hare. I sometimes had
a hare in each pocket, but they was very awkward
carriage; if one was sold, the other sagged
so. I very seldom sold them, at that time, at
less than 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, often 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and sometimes
5<i>s.</i> or more. I once sold a thumping old jack-hare
to a draper for 6<i>s.</i>; it was Christmas
time, and he thought it was a beauty. I went
into the country after that, among my friends,
and had a deal of ups and downs in different
parts. I was a navvy part of the time, till five
or six year back I came to London again, and
got into my old trade; but it’s quite a different
thing now. I hawks grouse, and every thing,
quite open. Leadenhall and Newgate is my
markets. Six of one and half-a-dozen of
t’other. When there’s a great arrival of game,
after a game battle” (he would so call a <i>battue</i>)
“and it’s warm weather, that’s my time of day,
for then I can buy cheap. A muggy day, when
it’s close and warm, is best of all. I have a tidy
bit of connection now in game, and don’t touch
poultry when I can get game. Grouse is the
first thing I get to sell. They are legal eating
on the 12th of August, but as there’s hundreds
of braces sold in London that day, and as
they’re shot in Scotland and Yorkshire, and
other places where there’s moors, in course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they’re killed before it’s legal. It’s not often
I can get them early in the season; not the
first week, but I have had three brace two
days before they were legal, and sold them
at 5<i>s.</i> a brace; they cost me 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, but I was
told I was favoured. I got them of a dealer,
but that’s a secret. I sold a few young partridges
with grouse this year at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a piece, allowing 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> if a brace
was taken. They weren’t legal eating till the
1st of September, but they was shot by grouse
shooters, and when I hawked them I called
them quails. Lord, sir, gentlefolks&mdash;and I
serve a good many, leastways their cooks, and
now and then themselves&mdash;<i>they</i> don’t make a
fuss about Game Laws; they’ve too much
sense. I’ve bought grouse quite fresh and
fine when there’s been a lot, and bad keeping
weather, at 1<i>s.</i> and 15<i>d.</i> each. I’ve sold them
sometimes at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> each, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the big ones, but only twice or thrice. If you
ask very low at first, people won’t buy, only
a few good judges, ’cause they think something
must be amiss. I once bought a dozen good
hares, on a Saturday afternoon, for 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It
was jolly hot, and I could hardly sell them.
I got 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece for three of them; 2<i>s.</i> for
the finest one; 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for five, no, for four; 1<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i> for two; and I had a deal of trouble to
get a landlord to take the last two for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
to wipe off a bit of a drink score. I didn’t
do so bad as it was, but if it hadn’t been Saturday,
I should have made a good thing of
’em. It’s very hard work carrying a dozen
hares; and every one of that lot&mdash;except two,
and <i>they</i> was fine leverets&mdash;was as cheap as
butcher’s meat at half-a-crown a piece. I’ve
done middling in partridges this year. I’ve
bought them, but mixed things they was, as
low as from 10<i>d.</i> to 16<i>d.</i> a brace, and have made
a profit, big or little as happened, on every one.
People that’s regular customers I always charge
6<i>d.</i> profit in 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to, and that’s far cheaper
than they can get served other ways. It’s chiefly
the game battles that does so much to cheapen
partridges or peasants” (so he always called
pheasants); “and it’s only then I meddles with
peasants. They’re sold handier than the other
birds at the shops, I think. They’re legal eating
on the 1st of October. Such nonsense! why isn’t
mutton made legal eating, only just at times, as
well? In very hard weather I’ve done well on
wild ducks. They come over here when the
weather’s a clipper, for you see cold weather
suits some birds and kills others. It aint hard
weather that’s driven them here; the frost has
drawed them here, because it’s only then they’re
cheap. I’ve bought beauties at 1<i>s.</i> a piece, and
one day I cleared 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> out of twelve brace of
them. I’ve often cleared 6<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i>&mdash;at least
as often as there’s been a chance. I knew a man
that did uncommon well on them; and he once
told a parson, or a journeyman parson, I don’t
know what he was, that if ever <i>he</i> prayed it was for
a hard winter and lots of wild ducks. I’ve done
a little sometimes in plover, and woodcock, and
snipe, but not so much. I never plays no tricks
with <i>my</i> birds. I trims them up to look well,
certainly. If they won’t keep, and won’t sell,
I sticks them into a landlord I knows, as likes
them high, for a quartern or a pot, or anything.
It’s often impossible to keep them. If they’re
hard hit it’s soon up with them. A sportsman,
if he has a good dog&mdash;but you’ll know that if
you’ve ever been a shooting, sir&mdash;may get close
upon a covey of young partridges before he
springs them, and then give them his one, two,
with both barrels, and they’re riddled to bits.
I may make 18<i>s.</i> a week all the year round,
because I have a connection. I’m very much
respected, I thinks, on my round, for I deal
fair; that there, sir, breeds respect, you know.
When I can’t get game (birds) I can sometimes,
indeed often, get hares, and mostly rabbits.
I’ve hawked venson, but did no good&mdash;though
I cried it at 4<i>d.</i> the lb. My best weeks
is worth 30<i>s.</i> to 35<i>s.</i>, my worst is 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> I’m
a good deal in the country, working it. I’m
forced to sell fish sometimes. Geese I sometimes
join a mate in selling. I don’t mix much with
the costermongers; in coorse I knows some. I
live middling. Do I ever eat my own game if
it’s high? No, sir, never. I couldn’t stand such
cag-mag&mdash;my stomach couldn’t&mdash;though I’ve
been a gentleman’s servant. Such stuff don’t
suit nobody but rich people, whose stomach’s
diseased by over-feeding, and that’s been brought
up to it, like. I’ve only myself to keep now.
I’ve had a wife or two, but we parted” (this
was said gravely enough); “there was nothing
to hinder us. I see them sometimes and treat
them.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of Two Poultry Hawkers.</span></h3>

<p>Two brothers, both good-looking and well-spoken
young men&mdash;one I might characterise
as handsome&mdash;gave me the following account.
I found them unwilling to speak of their youth,
and did not press them. I was afterwards informed
that their parents died within the same
month, and that the family was taken into the
workhouse; but the two boys left it in a little
time, and before they could benefit by any
schooling. Neither of them could read or write.
They left, I believe, with some little sum in
hand, to “start theirselves.” An intelligent
costermonger, who was with me when I saw the
two brothers, told me that “a costermonger
would rather be thought to have come out of
prison than out of a workhouse,” for his
“mates” would say, if they heard he had been
locked up, “O, he’s only been quodded for
pitching into a crusher.” The two brothers
wore clean smock country frocks over their
dress, and made a liberal display of their clean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
but coarse, shirts. It was on a Monday that
I saw them. What one brother said, the other
confirmed: so I use the plural “we.”</p>

<p>“We sell poultry and game, but stick most
to poultry, which suits our connection best. We
buy at Leadenhall. We’re never cheated in
the things we buy; indeed, perhaps, we could’nt
be. A salesman will say&mdash;Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; will&mdash;‘Buy,
if you like, I can’t recommend them.
Use your own judgment. They’re cheap.’ He
has only one price, and that’s often a low one.
We give from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> for good chickens,
and from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> mostly for geese and turkeys.
Pigeons is 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> a dozen. We aim at
6<i>d.</i> profit on chickens; and 1<i>s.</i>, if we can get it,
or 6<i>d.</i> if we can do no better, on geese and
turkeys. Ducks are the same as chickens. All
the year through, we may make 12<i>s.</i> a week a
piece. We work together, one on one side of
the street and the other on the other. It
answers best that way. People find we can’t
undersell one another. We buy the poultry,
whenever we can, undressed, and dress them
ourselves; pull the feathers off and make them
ready for cooking. We sell cheaper than the
shops, or we couldn’t sell at all. But you
must be known, to do any trade, or people will
think your poultry’s bad. We work game as
well, but mostly poultry. We’ve been on
hares to-day, mostly, and have made about
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece, but that’s an extra day. Our
best customers are tradesmen in a big way, and
people in the houses a little way out of town.
Working people don’t buy of us now. We’re
going to a penny gaff to-night” (it was then
between four and five); “we’ve no better way of
spending our time when our day’s work is done.”</p>

<p>From the returns before given, the street-sale
of poultry amounts yearly to</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Live Poultry.</span></h3>

<p>The street trade in live poultry is not considerable,
and has become less considerable every
year, since the facilities of railway conveyance
have induced persons in the suburbs to make
their purchases in London rather than of the
hawkers. Geese used to be bought very largely
by the hawkers in Leadenhall, and were driven
in flocks to the country, 500 being a frequent
number of a flock. Their sale commenced about
six miles from town in all directions, the purchasers
being those who, having the necessary
convenience, liked to fatten their own Christmas
geese, and the birds when bought were small and
lean. A few flocks, with 120 or 150 in each,
are still disposed of in this way; but the trade
is not a fifth of what it was. As this branch of
the business is not in the hands of the hawkers,
but generally of country poulterers resident in
the towns not far from the metropolis, I need
but allude to it. A few flocks of ducks are
driven in the same way.</p>

<p>The street trade in live poultry continues only
for three months&mdash;from the latter part of June
to the latter part of September. At this period,
the hawkers say, as they can’t get “dead” they
must get “live.” During these three months
the hawkers sell 500 chickens and 300 ducks
weekly, by hawking, or 10,400 in the season
of 13 weeks. Occasionally, as many as 50 men
and women&mdash;the same who hawk dead game
and poultry&mdash;are concerned in the traffic I am
treating of. At other times there are hardly 30,
and in some not 20 so employed, for if the weather
be temperate, dead poultry is preferred to
live by the hawkers. Taking the average of
“live” sellers at 25 every week, it gives only a
trade of 32 birds each weekly. Some, however,
will sell 18 in a day; but others, who occasionally
resort to the trade, only a dozen in a week. The
birds are sometimes carried in baskets on the
hawker’s arm, their heads being let through network
at the top; but more frequently they are
hawked in open wicker-work coops carried on
the head. The best live poultry are from Surrey
and Sussex; the inferior from Ireland, and perhaps
more than three-fourths of that sold by the
hawkers is Irish.</p>

<p>The further nature of the trade, and the class
of customers, is shown in the following statement,
given to me by a middle-aged man, who
had been familiar with the trade from his youth.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said, “I’ve had a turn at live
poultry for&mdash;let me see&mdash;someways between
twenty and twenty-five years. The business is
a sweater, sir; it’s heavy work, but ‘live’ aint so
heavy as ‘dead.’ There’s fewer of them to carry
in a round, that’s it. Ah! twenty years ago, or
better, live poultry was worth following. I did
a good bit in it. I’ve sold 160 fowls and ducks,
and more, in a week, and cleared about 4<i>l.</i> But
out of that I had to give a man 1<i>s.</i> a day, and his
peck, to help me. At that time I sold my ducks
and chickens&mdash;I worked nothing else&mdash;at from
2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece, according to size and quality.
Now, if I get from 14<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> it’s not so bad. I
sell more, I think, however, over 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> than under
it, but I’m perticler in my ‘live.’ I never
sold to any but people out of town that had convenience
to keep them, and Lord knows, I’ve seen
ponds I could jump over reckoned prime for
ducks. Them that keeps their gardens nice won’t
buy live poultry. I’ve seldom sold to the big houses
anything like to what I’ve done to the smaller.
The big houses, you see, goes for fancy bantems,
such as Sir John Seabright’s, or Spanish hens, or
a bit of a game cross, or real game&mdash;just for ornament,
and not for fighting&mdash;or for anything that’s
got its name up. I’ve known young couples buy
fowls to have their breakfast eggs from them.
One young lady told me to bring her&mdash;that’s
fifteen year ago, it is so&mdash;six couples, that I
knew would lay. I told her she’d better have
five hens to a cock, and she didn’t seem pleased,
but I’m sure I don’t know why, for I hope I’m
always civil. I told her there would be murder
if there was a cock to every hen. I supplied
her, and made 6<i>s.</i> by the job. I <i>have</i> sold
<span class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
live fowls to the Jews about Whitechapel,
on my way to Stratford and Bow, but only when
I’ve bought a bargain and sold one. I don’t
know nothing how the Jews kills their fowls.
Last summer I didn’t make 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day; no,
nor more than three half-crowns a week in ‘live.’
But that’s only part of my trade. I don’t
complain, so it’s nothing to nobody what I
makes. From Beever (De Beauvoir) Town to
Stamford Hill, and on to Tottenham and Edmonton,
and turning off Walthamstow way is as
good a round as any for live; it is so; but
nothing to what it was. Highgate and Hampstead
is middling. The t’other side the water
isn’t good at all.”</p>

<p>Fancy chickens, I may add, are never hawked,
nor are live pigeons, nor geese, nor turkeys.</p>

<p>The hawkers’ sale of live poultry may be
taken, at a moderate computation, as 6,500
chickens, and 3,900 ducks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Rabbit Selling in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Rabbit-selling cannot be said to be a distinct
branch of costermongering, but some street-sellers
devote themselves to it more exclusively
than to other “goods,” and, for five or six
months of the year, sell little else. It is not
often, though it is sometimes, united with the
game or poultry trade, as a stock of rabbits, of
a dozen or a dozen and a half, is a sufficient
load for one man. The best sale for rabbits is in
the suburbs. They are generally carried slung
two and two on a long pole, which is supported
on the man’s shoulders, or on a short one which
is carried in the hand. Lately, they have been
hawked about hung up on a barrow. The trade
is the briskest in the autumn and winter months;
but some men carry them, though they do not
confine themselves to the traffic in them, all the
year round. The following statement shows the
nature of the trade.</p>

<p>“I was born and bred a costermonger,” he
said, “and I’ve been concerned with everything
in the line. I’ve been mostly ‘on rabbits’ these
five or six years, but I always sold a few, and
now sometimes I sell a hare or two, and, if
rabbits is too dear, I tumble on to fish. I buy
at Leadenhall mainly. I’ve given from 6<i>s.</i> to
14<i>s.</i> a dozen for my rabbits. The usual price is
from 5<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> a dozen. [I may remark that
the costers buy nearly all the Scotch rabbits, at
an average of 6<i>s.</i> the dozen; and the Ostend
rabbits, which are a shilling or two dearer.]
They’re Hampshire rabbits; but I don’t know
where Hampshire is. I know they’re from
Hampshire, for they’re called ‘Wild Hampshire
rabbits, 1<i>s.</i> a pair.’ But still, as you say, that’s
only a call. I never sell a rabbit at 6<i>d.</i>, in
course&mdash;it costs more. My way in business
is to get 2<i>d.</i> profit, and the skin, on every
rabbit. If they cost me 8<i>d.</i>, I try to get 10<i>d.</i>
It’s the skins is the profit. The skins now brings
me from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a dozen. They’re best
in frosty weather. The fur’s thickest then. It
grows best in frost, I suppose. If I sell a
dozen, it’s a tidy day’s work. If I get 2<i>d.</i>
a-piece on them, and the skins at 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, it’s
3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, but I dont sell above 5 dozen in a week&mdash;that’s
16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a week, sir, is it? Wet and
dark weather is against me. People won’t often
buy rabbits by candlelight, if they’re ever so
sweet. Some weeks in spring and summer I
can’t sell above two dozen rabbits. I have sold
two dozen and ten on a Saturday in the country,
but then I had a young man to help me. I sell
the skins to a warehouse for hatters. My old
’oman works a little fish at a stall sometimes,
but she only can in fine weather, for we’ve a kid
that can hardly walk, and it don’t do to let it
stand out in the cold. Perhaps I may make
10<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i> a week all the year round. I’m
paying 1<i>s.</i> a week for 1<i>l.</i> borrowed, and paid 2<i>s.</i>
all last year; but I’ll pay no more after Christmas.
I did better on rabbits four or five year
back, because I sold more to working-people and
small shopkeepers than I do now. I suppose
it’s because they’re not so well off now as they
was then, and, as you say, butchers’-meat may
be cheaper now, and tempts them. I do best
short ways in the country. Wandsworth way
ain’t bad. No more is parts of Stoke-Newington
and Stamford-hill. St. John’s Wood and
Hampstead is middling. Hackney’s bad. I
goes all ways. I dont know what sort of people’s
my best customers. Two of ’em, I’ve been
told, is banker’s clerks, so in course they is rich.”</p>

<p>There are 600,000 rabbits sold every year in
the streets of London; these, at 7<i>d.</i> a-piece, give
17,500<i>l.</i> thus expended annually in the metropolis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Butter, Cheese,
and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>All these commodities used to be hawked in
the streets, and to a considerable extent. Until,
as nearly as I can ascertain, between twenty
and thirty years back, butter was brought from
Epping, and other neighbouring parts, where
good pasture existed, and hawked in the streets
of London, usually along with poultry and
eggs. This trade is among the more ancient
of the street-trades. Steam-vessels and railways,
however, have so stocked the markets,
that no hawking of butter or eggs, from any
agricultural part, even the nearest to London,
would be remunerative now. Eggs are brought
in immense quantities from France and Belgium,
though thirty, or even twenty years ago
the notion having of a good French egg, at a London
breakfast-table, would have been laughed
at as an absurd attempt at an impossible
achievement. The number of eggs now annually
imported into this kingdom, is 98,000,000,
half of which may be said to be the yearly consumption
of London. No butter is now hawked,
but sometimes a few “new laid” eggs are carried
from a rural part to the nearest metropolitan
suburb, and are sold readily enough, if the
purveyor be known. Mr. M’Culloch estimates
the average consumption of butter, in London,
at 6,250,000 lbs. per annum, or 5 oz., weekly,
each individual.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The hawking of cheese was never a prominent
part of the street-trade. Of late, its sale
in the streets, may be described as accidental.
A considerable quantity of American cheese
was hawked, or more commonly sold at a standing,
five or six years ago; unto December last,
and for three months preceding, cheese was
sold in the streets which had been rejected from
Government stores, as it would not “keep”
for the period required; but it was good for
immediate consumption, for which all street-goods
are required. This, and the American
cheese, were both sold in the streets at 3<i>d.</i> the
pound; usually, at fair weights, I am told, for it
might not be easy to deceive the poor in a thing
of such frequent purchase as “half a quarter or
a quarter” (of a pound) of cheese.</p>

<p>The total quantity of foreign cheese consumed,
yearly, in the metropolis may be estimated
at 25,000,000 lbs. weight, or half of the
gross quantity annually imported.</p>

<p>The following statement shows the quantity
and sum paid for the game and poultry sold in
London streets:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_SELLERS_OF_TREES_SHRUBS_FLOWERS_CUT_AND_IN_POTS_ROOTS_SEEDS_AND_BRANCHES"></a>OF THE SELLERS OF TREES, SHRUBS, FLOWERS (CUT AND
IN POTS), ROOTS, SEEDS, AND BRANCHES.</h2>
</div>


<p>The street-sellers of whom I have now to treat
comprise those who deal in trees and shrubs, in
flowers (whether in pots, or merely with soil
attached to the roots, or cut from the plant
as it grows in the garden), and in seeds and
branches (as of holly, mistletoe, ivy, yew, laurel,
palm, lilac, and may). The “root-sellers”
(as the dealers in flowers in pots are mostly
called) rank, when in a prosperous business,
with the highest “aristocracy” of the street-greengrocers.
The condition of a portion of
them, may be characterised by a term which
is readily understood as “comfortable,” that
is to say, comparatively comfortable, when the
circumstances of other street-sellers are considered.
I may here remark, that though there
are a great number of Scotchmen connected with
horticultural labour in England, but more in the
provincial than the metropolitan districts, there
is not one Scotchman concerned in the metropolitan
street-sale of flowers; nor, indeed, as I
have good reason to believe, is there a single
Scotchman earning his bread as a costermonger
in London. A non-commissioned officer in an
infantry regiment, a Scotchman, whom I met
with a few months back, in the course of my
inquiries concerning street musicians, told me
that he thought any of his young countrymen,
if hard pushed “to get a crust,” would
enlist, rather than resort, even under favourable
circumstances, to any kind of street-sale in
London.</p>

<p>The dealers in trees and shrubs are the same
as the root-sellers.</p>

<p>The same may be said, but with some few
exceptions, of the seed-sellers.</p>

<p>The street-trade in holly, mistletoe, and all
kinds of evergreens known as “Christmas,” is
in the hands of the coster boys more than the
men, while the trade in may, &amp;c., is almost
altogether confined to these lads.</p>

<p>The root-sellers do not reside in any particular
localities, but there are more of them living in
the outskirts than in the thickly populated
streets.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of cut flowers present characteristics
peculiarly their own. This trade is
mostly in the hands of girls, who are of two
classes. This traffic ranks with the street sale
of water-cresses and congreves, that is to say,
among the lowest grades of the street-trade,
being pursued only by the very poor, or the
very young.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pleasantest of all cries in early
spring is that of “All a-growing&mdash;all a-blowing”
heard for the first time in the season. It
is that of the “root-seller” who has stocked
his barrow with primroses, violets, and daisies.
Their beauty and fragrance gladden the senses;
and the first and, perhaps, unexpected sight of
them may prompt hopes of the coming year,
such as seem proper to the spring.</p>

<p>Cobbett has insisted, and with unquestioned
truth, that a fondness for bees and flowers is
among the very best characteristics of the
English peasant. I consider it equally unquestionable
that a fondness for in-door flowers,
is indicative of the good character and healthful
tastes, as well as of the domestic and industrious
habits, of the city artizan. Among some
of the most intelligent and best-conducted of
these artizans, I may occasionally have found,
on my visits to their homes, neither flowers nor
birds, but then I have found books.</p>

<p>United with the fondness for the violet, the
wallflower, the rose&mdash;is the presence of the
quality which has been pronounced the handmaiden
of all the virtues&mdash;cleanliness. I
believe that the bunch of violets, on which a
poor woman or her husband has expended 1<i>d.</i>,
rarely ornaments an unswept hearth. In my
investigations, I could not but notice how the
presence or absence of flowers, together with
other indications of the better tastes, marked
the difference between the well-paid and the
ill-paid workman. Concerning the tailors, for
instance, I had occasion to remark, of the
dwellings of these classes:&mdash;“In the one, you
occasionally find small statues of Shakspere
beneath glass shades; in the other, all is dirt
and fœtor. The working-tailor’s comfortable
first-floor at the West-end is redolent with the
perfume of the small bunch of violets that
stands in a tumbler over the mantel-piece; the
sweater’s wretched garret is rank with the
stench of filth and herrings.” The presence of
the bunch of flowers of itself tells us of “a better
state of things” elevating the workman; for,
amidst the squalid poverty and fustiness of a
slopworker’s garret, the nostril loses its daintiness
of sense, so that even a freshly fragrant
wallflower is only so many yellow petals and
green leaves.</p>

<p>A love of flowers is also observable among
men whose avocations are out of doors, and
those whose habits are necessarily those of
order and punctuality.</p>

<p>Among this class are such persons as gentlemen’s
coachmen, who delight in the display
of a flower or two in the button-holes of
their coats when out of doors, and in small
vases in their rooms in their masters’ mews. I
have even seen the trellis work opposite the
windows of cabmen’s rooms, which were over
stables, with a projecting roof covering the whole,
thickly yellow and green with the flowers and
leaves of the easily-trained nasturtium and herb
“twopence.” The omnibus driver occasionally
“sports a nosegay”&mdash;as he himself might
word it&mdash;in his button-hole; and the stage-coachman
of old felt he was improperly dressed
if a big bunch of flowers were not attached to
his coat. Sailors ashore are likewise generally
fond of flowers.</p>

<p>A delight in flowers is observable, also,
among the workers whose handicraft requires
the exercise of taste, and whose eyes are sensible,
from the nature of their employment, to
the beauty of colour. To this class belong
especially the Spitalfields’ silk-weavers. At one
time the Spitalfields weavers were almost the
only botanists in London, and their love of
flowers is still strong. I have seen fuchsias
gladdening the weaver’s eyes by being placed
near his loom, their crimson pendants swinging
backwards and forwards to the motion of the
treadles, while his small back garden has been
many-coloured with dahlias. These weavers,
too, were at one time highly-successful as
growers of tulips.</p>

<p>Those out-door workmen, whose calling is of
coarse character, are never known to purchase
flowers, which to them are mere trumpery. Perhaps
no one of my readers ever saw a flower in
the possession of a flusherman, nightman, slaughterer,
sweep, gaslayer, gut and tripe-preparer,
or such like labourer. <i>Their</i> eyes convey to
the mind no appreciation of beauty, and the
sense of smell is actually dead in them, except
the odour be rank exceedingly.</p>

<p>The fondness for flowers in London is
strongest in the women, and, perhaps, strongest
in those whose callings are in-door and sedentary.
Flowers are to them a companionship.</p>

<p>It remains only for me to state that, in the
poorest districts, and among people where there
is no sense of refinement or but a small love
for natural objects, flowers are little known.
Flowers are not bought by the slop-workers, the
garret and chamber-masters of Bethnal-green,
nor in the poor Irish districts, nor by the City
people. Indeed, as I have observed, there is
not a flower-stand in the city.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that, in poor districts,
the first appearance of flowers conveys
to the slop-workman only one pleasurable association&mdash;that
the season of warmth has arrived,
and that he will not only escape being chilled
with cold, but that he will be delivered from
the heavy burden of providing fire and candle.</p>

<p>A pleasant-looking man, with an appearance
which the vulgar characterise as “jolly,” and
with hearty manners, gave me the following
account as to the character of his customers.
He had known the business since he was a
boy, his friends having been in it previously.
He said:</p>

<p>“There’s one old gentleman a little way out
of town, he always gives 1<i>s.</i> for the first violet
root that any such as me carries there. I’m
often there before any others: ‘Ah!’ he says,
‘here you are; you’ve come, like Buonaparte,
with your violet.’ I don’t know exactly what
he means. I don’t like to ask him you see;
for, though he’s civil, he’s not what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
may call a free sort of man&mdash;that’s it.” [I
explained to him that the allusion was to
Buonaparte’s emblem of the violet, with the
interpretation he or his admirers gave to it&mdash;“I
come in the spring.”] “That’s it, sir, is
it?” he resumed; “well, I’m glad I know,
because I don’t like to be puzzled. Mine’s a
puzzling trade, though. Violets have a good
sale. I’ve sold six dozen roots in a day, and
only half as many primroses and double-daisies,
if half. Everybody likes violets. I’ve sold
some to poor people in town, but they like their
roots in pots. They haven’t a bit of a garden for
’em. More shame too I say, when they pays
such rents. People that sits working all day is
very fond of a sweet flower. A gentleman that’s
always a-writing or a-reading in his office&mdash;he’s
in the timber-trade&mdash;buys something of me every
time I see him; twice or thrice a week, sometimes.
I can’t say what he does with them
all. Barmaids, though you mightn’t think it, sir,
is wery tidy customers. So, sometimes, is young
women that’s in an improper way of life, about
Lisson-grove, and in some parts near Oxford-street.
They buys all sorts. Perhaps more
stocks than anything, for they’re beautiful roots,
and not dear. I’ve sold real beauties for 2<i>d.</i>&mdash;real
beauties, but small; 6<i>d.</i> is a fair price; one
stock will perfume a house. I tell my customers
not to sleep with them in the room; it isn’t good
for the health. A doctor told me that, and said,
‘You ought to give me a fuchsia for my opinion.’
That was his joke. Primroses I sell most of&mdash;they’re
not in pots&mdash;two or three or four miles
out of town, and most if a family’s come into
a new house, or changed their house, if there’s
children. The young ones teases the old ones
to buy them to set in the garden, and when
children gets fairly to work that way, it’s a
sure sale. If they can’t get over father,
they’ll get over mother. Busy men never buy
flowers, as far as I’ve seen.” [‘In no thoroughfare
in the city, I am assured, is there
a flower-stand&mdash;a circumstance speaking volumes
as to the habits and tastes of the
people. Of fruit-stalls and chop-houses there
are in the neighbourhood of the Exchange, more
than in any other part of London perhaps&mdash;the
faculty of perceiving the beauty of colour,
form, and perfume, as combined in flowers is
not common to the man of business. The
pleasures of the palate, however, they can all
understand.’] “Parsons and doctors are often
tidy customers,” resumed my informant. “They
have a good deal of sitting and reading, I believe.
I’ve heard a parson say to his wife,
‘Do, my dear, go and buy a couple of those
wallflowers for my study.’ I don’t do much
for working-men; the women’s my best customers.
There’s a shoemaker to be sure comes
down sometimes with his old woman to lay out
2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> on me; ‘Let’s have something that
smells strong,’ he’ll say, ‘stronger than cobbler’s
wax; for, though I can’t smell that, others
can.’ I’ve sold him musks (musk-plants) as
often as anything.</p>

<p>“The poor people buy rather largely at
times; that is, many of them buy. One day last
summer, my old woman and me sold 600 penny
pots of mignonette; and all about you saw them&mdash;and
it was a pleasure to see them&mdash;in the poor
women’s windows. The women are far the best
customers. There was the mignonette behind
the bits of bars they have, in the shape of
gates and such like, in the front of their windows,
in the way of preventing the pots falling
into the street. Mignonette’s the best of all
for a sure sale; where can you possibly have a
sweeter or a nicer penn’orth, pot and all.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Trees and Shrubs.</span></h3>

<p>The street-trade in trees and shrubs is an appendage
of “root-selling,” and not an independent
avocation. The season of supply at the
markets extends over July, August, September,
and October, with a smaller trade in the winter
and spring months. At the nursery gardens, from
the best data I can arrive at, there are about twice
as many trees and shrubs purchased as in the
markets by the costermongers. Nor is this the
only difference. It is the more costly descriptions
that are bought at the nursery grounds.</p>

<p>The trees and shrubs are bought at the
gardens under precisely the same circumstances
as the roots, but the trade is by no means popular
with the root-sellers. They regard these
heavy, cumbrous goods, as the smarter costers
do such things as turnips and potatoes, requiring
more room, and yielding less profit. “It
breaks a man’s heart,” said one dealer, “and half
kills his beast, going round with a lot of heavy
things, that perhaps you can’t sell.” The street-dealers
say they must keep them, “or people
will go, where they can get roots, and trees, and
everything, all together.” In winter, or in early
spring, the street-seller goes a round now and
then, with evergreens and shrubs alone, and
the trade is then less distasteful to him. The
trees and shrubs are displayed, when the market-space
allows, on a sort of stand near the
flower-stand; sometimes they are placed on the
ground, along-side the flower-stand, but only
when no better display can be made.</p>

<p>The trees and shrubs sold by the costers are
mezereons, rhododendrons, savine, laurustinus,
acacias (of the smaller genera, some being highly
aromatic when in flower), myrtles, guelder-roses
(when small), privet, genistas, broom, furze
(when small), the cheaper heaths, syringas
(small), lilacs (almost always young and for
transplanting), southernwood (when large), box
(large) dwarf laurels, variegated laurels (called
a <i>cuber</i> by the street-people), and young fir-trees,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The prices of trees vary far more than
flower-roots, because they are dependent upon
<i>size</i> for value. “Why,” said one man, “I’ve
bought roddies, as I calls them (rhododendrons),
at 4<i>s.</i> a dozen, but they was scrubby things,
and I’ve bought them at 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I once gave
5<i>s.</i> for two trees of them, which I had ordered,
and there was a rare grumbling about the price,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
though I only charged 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the two, which
was 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a piece for carriage, and hard earned
too, to carry them near five miles in my cart,
almost on purpose, but I thought I was pleasing
a good customer. Then there’s myrtles,
why I can get them at 5<i>d.</i> a piece, and at 5<i>s.</i>,
and a deal more if wanted. You can have
myrtles that a hat might be very big for them
to grow in, and myrtles that will fill a great
window in a fine house. I’ve bought common
heaths at 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a dozen.”</p>

<p>The coster ordinarily confines himself to the
cheaper sorts of plants, and rarely meddles with
such things as acacias, mezereons, savines, syringas,
lilacs, or even myrtles, and with none of
these things unless cheap. “Trees, real trees,”
I was told, “are often as cheap as anything.
Them young firs there was 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a dozen, and
a man at market can buy four or six of them if
he don’t want a dozen.”</p>

<p>The customers for trees and shrubs are generally
those who inhabit the larger sort of houses,
where there is room in the hall or the windows
for display; or where there is a garden capacious
enough for the implantation of the shrubs.
Three-fourths of the trees are sold on a round,
and when purchased at a stall the costermonger
generally undertakes to deliver them at the
purchaser’s residence, if not too much out of
his way, in his regular rounds. Or he may
diverge, and make a round on speculation,
purposely. There is as much bartering trees
for old clothes, as for roots, and as many, or
more, complaints of the hard bargainings of
ladies: “I’d rather sell polyanthuses at a
farthing a piece profit to poor women, if I could
get no more,” said one man, “than I’d work
among them screws that’s so fine in grand caps
and so civil. They’d skin a flea for his hide
and tallow.”</p>

<p>The number of trees and shrubs sold annually,
in the streets, are, as near as I can ascertain,
as follows&mdash;I have added to the quantity
purchased by the street-sellers, at the metropolitan
markets, the amount bought by them at the
principal nursery-gardens in the environs of
London:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The London Flower Girls.</span></h3>

<p>It is not easy to arrive at any accurate estimate
of the number of flower-sellers in the streets of
London. The cause of the difficulty lies in the
fact that none can be said to devote themselves
entirely to the sale of flowers in the street, for
the flower-sellers, when oranges are cheap and
good, find their sale of the fruit more certain
and profitable than that of flowers, and resort
to it accordingly. Another reason is, that a
poor costermonger will on a fine summer’s day
send out his children to sell flowers, while
on other days they may be selling water-cresses
or, perhaps, onions. Sunday is the best
day for flower-selling, and one experienced man
computed, that in the height and pride of the
summer 400 children were selling flowers, on
the Sundays, in the streets. Another man
thought that number too low an estimate, and
contended that it was nearer 800. I found
more of the opinion of my last mentioned informant
than of the other, but I myself am
disposed to think the smaller number nearer the
truth. On week days it is computed there are
about half the number of flower-sellers that there
are on the Sundays. The trade is almost entirely
in the hands of children, the girls outnumbering
the boys by more than eight to one.
The ages of the girls vary from six to twenty;
few of the boys are older than twelve, and most
of them are under ten.</p>

<p>Of flower-girls there are two classes. Some
girls, and they are certainly the smaller class
of the two, avail themselves of the sale of flowers
in the streets for immoral purposes, or rather,
they seek to eke out the small gains of their
trade by such practises. They frequent the great
thoroughfares, and offer their bouquets to gentlemen,
whom on an evening they pursue for
a hundred yards or two in such places as the
Strand, mixing up a leer with their whine for
custom or for charity. Their ages are from
fourteen to nineteen or twenty, and sometimes
they remain out offering their flowers&mdash;or dried
lavender when no fresh flowers are to be had&mdash;until
late at night. They do not care, to make
their appearance in the streets until towards
evening, and though they solicit the custom of
ladies, they rarely follow or importune them.
Of this class I shall treat more fully under another
head.</p>

<p>The other class of flower-girls is composed of
the girls who, wholly or partially, depend upon
the sale of flowers for their own support or as
an assistance to their parents. Some of them
are the children of street-sellers, some are
orphans, and some are the daughters of mechanics
who are out of employment, and who
prefer any course rather than an application to
the parish. These girls offer their flowers in
the principal streets at the West End, and
resort greatly to the suburbs; there are a few,
also, in the business thoroughfares. They
walk up and down in front of the houses, offering
their flowers to any one looking out of the
windows, or they stand at any likely place.
They are generally very persevering, more especially
the younger children, who will run along,
barefooted, with their “Please, gentleman, do
buy my flowers. Poor little girl!”&mdash;“Please,
kind lady, buy my violets. O, do! please! Poor
little girl! Do buy a bunch, please, kind lady!”</p>

<p>The statement I give, “of two orphan flower-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>sellers”
furnishes another proof, in addition to
the many I have already given, of the heroic
struggles of the poor, and of the truth of the
saying, “What would the poor do without the
poor?”</p>

<p>The better class of flower-girls reside in
Lisson-grove, in the streets off Drury-lane,
in St. Giles’s, and in other parts inhabited by
the very poor. Some of them live in lodging-houses,
the stench and squalor of which are in
remarkable contrast to the beauty and fragrance
of the flowers they sometimes have to carry
thither with them unsold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Two Orphan Flower Girls.</span></h3>

<p>Of these girls the elder was fifteen and
the younger eleven. Both were clad in old,
but not torn, dark print frocks, hanging so
closely, and yet so loosely, about them as to
show the deficiency of under-clothing; they
wore old broken black chip bonnets. The older
sister (or rather half-sister) had a pair of old
worn-out shoes on her feet, the younger was
barefoot, but trotted along, in a gait at once
quick and feeble&mdash;as if the soles of her little
feet were impervious, like horn, to the roughness
of the road. The elder girl has a modest
expression of countenance, with no pretensions
to prettiness except in having tolerably good
eyes. Her complexion was somewhat muddy,
and her features somewhat pinched. The
younger child had a round, chubby, and even
rosy face, and quite a healthful look. Her portrait
is here given.</p>

<p>They lived in one of the streets near Drury-lane.
They were inmates of a house, not let
out as a lodging-house, in separate beds, but
in rooms, and inhabited by street-sellers and
street-labourers. The room they occupied was
large, and one dim candle lighted it so insufficiently
that it seemed to exaggerate the dimensions.
The walls were bare and discoloured
with damp. The furniture consisted of a crazy
table and a few chairs, and in the centre of
the room was an old four-post bedstead of the
larger size. This bed was occupied nightly by
the two sisters and their brother, a lad just
turned thirteen. In a sort of recess in a corner
of the room was the decency of an old curtain&mdash;or
something equivalent, for I could hardly see
in the dimness&mdash;and behind this was, I presume,
the bed of the married couple. The
three children paid 2<i>s.</i> a week for the room,
the tenant an Irishman out of work paying
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, but the furniture was his, and his wife
aided the children in their trifle of washing,
mended their clothes, where such a thing was
possible, and such like. The husband was
absent at the time of my visit, but the wife
seemed of a better stamp, judging by her
appearance, and by her refraining from any
direct, or even indirect, way of begging, as
well as from the “Glory be to Gods!” “the
heavens be your honour’s bed!” or “it’s the
thruth I’m telling of you sir,” that I so frequently
meet with on similar visits.</p>

<p>The elder girl said, in an English accent,
not at all garrulously, but merely in answer
to my questions: “I sell flowers, sir; we live
almost on flowers when they are to be got. I
sell, and so does my sister, all kinds, but it’s
very little use offering any that’s not sweet.
I think it’s the sweetness as sells them. I
sell primroses, when they’re in, and violets, and
wall-flowers, and stocks, and roses of different
sorts, and pinks, and carnations, and mixed
flowers, and lilies of the valley, and green
lavender, and mignonette (but that I do very
seldom), and violets again at this time of the
year, for we get them both in spring and
winter.” [They are forced in hot-houses for
winter sale, I may remark.] “The best sale
of all is, I think, moss-roses, young moss-roses.
We do best of all on them. Primroses are
good, for people say: ‘Well, here’s spring
again to a certainty.’ Gentlemen are our
best customers. I’ve heard that they buy
flowers to give to the ladies. Ladies have
sometimes said: ‘A penny, my poor girl,
here’s three-halfpence for the bunch.’ Or
they’ve given me the price of two bunches for
one; so have gentlemen. I never had a rude
word said to me by a gentleman in my life.
No, sir, neither lady nor gentleman ever gave
me 6<i>d.</i> for a bunch of flowers. I never had a
sixpence given to me in my life&mdash;never. I
never go among boys, I know nobody but
my brother. My father was a tradesman in
Mitchelstown, in the County Cork. I don’t
know what sort of a tradesman he was. I
never saw him. He was a tradesman I’ve
been told. I was born in London. Mother
was a chairwoman, and lived very well. None
of us ever saw a father.” [It was evident that
they were illegitimate children, but the landlady
had never seen the mother, and could give
me no information.] “We don’t know anything
about our fathers. We were all ‘mother’s
children.’ Mother died seven years ago last
Guy Faux day. I’ve got myself, and my
brother and sister a bit of bread ever since, and
never had any help but from the neighbours.
I never troubled the parish. O, yes, sir, the
neighbours is all poor people, very poor, some
of them. We’ve lived with her” (indicating
her landlady by a gesture) “the two years,
and off and on before that. I can’t say how
long.” “Well, I don’t know exactly,” said
the landlady, “but I’ve had them with me
almost all the time, for four years, as near as
I can recollect; perhaps more. I’ve moved
three times, and they always followed me.”
In answer to my inquiries the landlady assured
me that these two poor girls, were never out of
doors all the time she had known them after
six at night. “We’ve always good health.
We can all read.” [Here the three somewhat
insisted upon proving to me their proficiency
in reading, and having produced a Roman
Catholic book, the “Garden of Heaven,” they
read very well.] “I put myself,” continued
the girl, “and I put my brother and sister to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a Roman Catholic school&mdash;and to Ragged
schools&mdash;but <i>I</i> could read before mother died.
My brother can write, and I pray to God that
he’ll do well with it. I buy my flowers at
Covent Garden; sometimes, but very seldom,
at Farringdon. I pay 1<i>s.</i> for a dozen bunches,
whatever flowers are in. Out of every two
bunches I can make three, at 1<i>d.</i> a piece. Sometimes
one or two over in the dozen, but not so
often as I would like. We make the bunches
up ourselves. We get the rush to tie them
with for nothing. We put their own leaves
round these violets (she produced a bunch).
The paper for a dozen costs a penny; sometimes
only a halfpenny. The two of us doesn’t
make less than 6<i>d.</i> a day, unless it’s very ill
luck. But religion teaches us that God will
support us, and if we make less we say nothing.
We do better on oranges in March or April, I
think it is, than on flowers. Oranges keep better
than flowers you see, sir. We make 1<i>s.</i> a day,
and 9<i>d.</i> a day, on oranges, the two of us. I
wish they was in all the year. I generally go
St. John’s-wood way, and Hampstead and Highgate
way with my flowers. I can get them
nearly all the year, but oranges is better liked
than flowers, I think. I always keep 1<i>s.</i> stock-money,
if I can. If it’s bad weather, so bad
that we can’t sell flowers at all, and so if we’ve
had to spend our stock-money for a bit of bread,
<i>she</i> (the landlady) lends us 1<i>s.</i>, if she has one,
or she borrows one of a neighbour, if she
hasn’t, or if the neighbours hasn’t it, she borrows
it at a dolly-shop” (the illegal pawn-shop).
“There’s 2<i>d.</i> a week to pay for 1<i>s.</i> at
a dolly, and perhaps an old rug left for it; if
it’s very hard weather, the rug must be taken
at night time, or we are starved with the cold.
It sometimes has to be put into the dolly again
next morning, and then there’s 2<i>d.</i> to pay for
it for the day. We’ve had a frock in for 6<i>d.</i>,
and that’s a penny a week, and the same for a
day. We never pawned anything; we have
nothing they would take in at the pawnshop.
We live on bread and tea, and sometimes a
fresh herring of a night. Sometimes we don’t
eat a bit all day when we’re out; sometimes
we take a bit of bread with us, or buy a bit.
My sister can’t eat taturs; they sicken her.
I don’t know what emigrating means.” [I
informed her and she continued]: “No, sir,
I wouldn’t like to emigrate and leave brother
and sister. If they went with me I don’t
think I should like it, not among strangers.
I think our living costs us 2<i>s.</i> a week for the
two of us; the rest goes in rent. That’s all
we make.”</p>

<p>The brother earned from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a week,
with an occasional meal, as a costermonger’s
boy. Neither of them ever missed mass on a
Sunday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of a Flower Girl.</span></h3>

<p>Some of these girls are, as I have stated, of an
immoral character, and some of them are sent
out by their parents to make out a livelihood
by prostitution. One of this class, whom I
saw, had come out of prison a short time previously.
She was not nineteen, and had been
sentenced about a twelvemonth before to three
months’ imprisonment with hard labour, “for
heaving her shoe,” as she said, “at the Lord
Mayor, to get a comfortable lodging, for she
was tired of being about the streets.” After
this she was locked up for breaking the lamps
in the street. She alleged that her motive for
this was a belief that by committing some such
act she might be able to get into an asylum for
females. She was sent out into the streets by
her father and mother, at the age of nine, to
sell flowers. Her father used to supply her
with the money to buy the flowers, and she
used to take the proceeds of the day’s work
home to her parents. She used to be out
frequently till past midnight, and seldom or
never got home before nine. She associated
only with flower-girls of loose character. The
result may be imagined. She could not state
positively that her parents were aware of the
manner in which she got the money she took
home to them. She supposes that they must have
imagined what her practices were. He used to
give her no supper if she “didn’t bring home
a good bit of money.” Her father and mother
did little or no work all this while. They lived
on what she brought home. At thirteen years
old she was sent to prison (she stated) “for
selling combs in the street” (it was winter, and
there were no flowers to be had). She was incarcerated
fourteen days, and when liberated
she returned to her former practices. The very
night that she came home from gaol her father
sent her out into the streets again. She continued
in this state, her father and mother
living upon her, until about twelve months before
I received this account from her, when her
father turned her out of his house, because she
didn’t bring home money enough. She then
went into Kent, hop-picking, and there fell in
with a beggar, who accosted her while she was
sitting under a tree. He said, “You have got
a very bad pair of shoes on; come with me,
and you shall have some better ones.” She
consented, and walked with him into the village
close by, where they stood out in the middle of
the streets, and the man began addressing the
people, “My kind good Christians, me and
my poor wife here is ashamed to appear before
you in the state we are in.” She remained
with this person all the winter, and travelled
with him through the country, begging. He
was a beggar by trade. In the spring she
returned to the flower-selling, but scarcely got
any money either by that or other means. At
last she grew desperate, and wanted to get
back to prison. She broke the lamps outside
the Mansion-house, and was sentenced
to fourteen days’ imprisonment. She had
been out of prison nearly three weeks when
I saw her, and was in training to go into an
asylum. She was sick and tired, she said, of
her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Lavender.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of green lavender in the streets is
carried on by the same class as the sale of
flowers, and is, as often as flowers, used for
immoral purposes, when an evening or night
sale is carried on.</p>

<p>The lavender is sold at the markets in
bundles, each containing a dozen branches.
It is sold principally to ladies in the suburbs,
who purchase it to deposit in drawers and wardrobes;
the odour communicated to linen from
lavender being, perhaps, more agreeable and
more communicable than that from any other
flower. Nearly a tenth of the market sale may
be disposed of in this way. Some costers sell it
cheap to recommend themselves to ladies who
are customers, that they may have the better
chance for a continuance of those ladies’ custom.</p>

<p>The number of lavender-sellers can hardly be
given as distinct from that of flower-sellers, because
any flower-girl will sell lavender, “when
it is in season.” The season continues from the
beginning of July to the end of September. In
the winter months, generally after day-fall, dried
lavender is offered for sale; it is bought at the
herb-shops. There is, however, an addition to the
number of the flower-girls of a few old women,
perhaps from twenty to thirty, who vary their
street-selling avocations by going from door to
door in the suburbs with lavender for sale, but
do not stand to offer it in the street.</p>

<p>The street-seller’s profit on lavender is now
somewhat more than cent. per cent., as the
bundle, costing 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, brings when tied up in
sprigs, at least, 6<i>d.</i> The profit, I am told, was,
six or seven years ago, 200 per cent.; “but
people will have better penn’orths now.” I
was informed, by a person long familiar with the
trade in flowers, that, from twenty to twenty-five
years ago, the sale was the best. It was a fashionable
amusement for ladies to tie the sprigs of
lavender together, compressing the stems very
tightly with narrow ribbon of any favourite
colour, the heads being less tightly bound, or
remaining unbound; the largest stems were in
demand for this work. The lavender bundle,
when its manufacture was complete, was placed
in drawers, or behind books in the shelves of a
glazed book-case, so that a most pleasant atmosphere
was diffused when the book-case was
opened.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cut Flowers.</span></h3>

<p>I now give the quantity of cut flowers sold in
the streets. The returns have been derived from
nursery-men and market-salesmen. It will be
seen how fully these returns corroborate the
statement of the poor flower-girl&mdash;(p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>)&mdash;“it’s
very little use offering anything that’s not
sweet.”</p>

<p>I may remark, too, that at the present period,
from “the mildness of the season,” wallflowers,
primroses, violets, and polyanthuses are almost
as abundant as in spring sunshine.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Flowers in
Pots, Roots, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The “flower-root sellers”&mdash;for I heard them
so called to distinguish them from the sellers of
“cut flowers”&mdash;are among the best-mannered
and the best-dressed of all the street-sellers I
have met with, but that only as regards a portion
of them. Their superiority in this respect
may perhaps be in some measure attributable
to their dealing with a better class of customers&mdash;with
persons who, whether poor or rich, exercise
healthful tastes.</p>

<p>I may mention, that I found the street-sellers
of “roots”&mdash;always meaning thereby flower-roots
in bloom&mdash;more attached to their trade
than others of their class.</p>

<p>The roots, sold in the streets, are bought in
the markets and at the nursery-gardens; but
about three-fourths of those required by the
better class of street-dealers are bought at the
gardens, as are “cut flowers” occasionally.
Hackney is the suburb most resorted to by the
root-sellers. The best “pitches” for the sale
of roots in the street are situated in the New-road,
the City-road, the Hampstead-road, the
Edgeware-road, and places of similar character,
where there is a constant stream of passers
along, who are not too much immersed in
business. Above three-fourths of the sale is
effected by itinerant costermongers. For this
there is one manifest reason: a flower-pot, with
the delicate petals of its full-blown moss-rose,
perhaps, suffers even from the trifling concussion
in the journey of an omnibus, for instance.
To carry a heavy flower-pot, even any short
distance, cannot be expected, and to take a cab
for its conveyance adds greatly to the expense.
Hence, flower-roots are generally purchased at
the door of the buyer.</p>

<p>For the flowers of commoner or easier culture,
the root-seller receives from 1<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> These
are primroses, polyanthuses, cowslips (but in
small quantities comparatively), daisies (single
and double,&mdash;and single or wild, daisies were
coming to be more asked for, each 1<i>d.</i>), small
early wallflowers, candy-tufts, southernwood
(called “lad’s love” or “old man” by some),
and daffodils, (but daffodils were sometimes
dearer than 3<i>d.</i>). The plants that may be said
to struggle against frost and snow in a hard
season, such as the snowdrop, the crocus, and
the mezereon, are rarely sold by the costers;
“They come too soon,” I was told. The prim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>roses,
and the other plants I have enumerated,
are sold, for the most part, not in pots, but with
soil attached to the roots, so that they may be
planted in a garden (as they most frequently
are) or in a pot.</p>

<p>Towards the close of May, in an early season,
and in the two following months, the root-trade
is at its height. Many of the stalls and barrows
are then exceedingly beautiful, the barrow often
resembling a moving garden. The stall-keepers
have sometimes their flowers placed on a series
of shelves, one above another, so as to present
a small amphitheatre of beautiful and diversified
hues; the purest white, as in the lily of the
valley, to the deepest crimson, as in the fuschia;
the bright or rust-blotted yellow of the wallflower,
to the many hues of the stock. Then
there are the pinks and carnations, double and
single, with the rich-coloured and heavily
scented “clove-pinks;” roses, mignonette, the
velvetty pansies (or heart’s-ease), the white and
orange lilies, calceolarias, balsams (a flower
going out of fashion), geraniums (flowers coming
again into fashion), musk-plants, London
pride (and other saxifrages; the species known,
oddly enough, as London pride being a native
of wild and mountainous districts, such as
botanists call “Alpine habitats,”) and the many
coloured lupins. Later again come the China-asters,
the African marigolds, the dahlias, the
poppies, and the common and very aromatic
marigold. Later still there are the Michaelmas
daisies&mdash;the growth of the “All-Hallow’n summer,”
to which Falstaff was compared.</p>

<p>There is a class of “roots” in which the
street-sellers, on account of their general dearness,
deal so sparingly, that I cannot class
them as a part of the business. Among these
are anemones, hyacinths, tulips, ranunculuses,
and the orchidaceous tribe. Neither do
the street people meddle, unless very exceptionally,
with the taller and statelier plants,
such as foxgloves, hollyoaks, and sunflowers;
these are too difficult of carriage for their purpose.
Nor do they sell, unless again as an exception,
such flowers as require support&mdash;the
convolvolus and the sweet-pea, for instance.</p>

<p>The plants I have specified vary in price.
Geraniums are sold at from 3<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>; pinks at
from 3<i>d.</i> for the common pink, to 2<i>s.</i> for the
best single clove, and 4<i>s.</i> for the best double;
stocks, as they are small and single, to their
being large and double, from 3<i>d.</i> (and sometimes
less) to 2<i>s.</i>; dahlias from 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>;
fuschias, from 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>; rose-bushes from 3<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and sometimes, but not often, much
higher; musk-plants, London pride, lupins, &amp;c.,
are 1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i>, pots generally included.</p>

<p>To carry on his business efficiently, the root-seller
mostly keeps a pony and a cart, to convey
his purchases from the garden to his stall or his
barrow, and he must have a sheltered and cool
shed in which to deposit the flowers which are
to be kept over-night for the morrow’s business.
“It’s a great bother, sir,” said a root-seller,
“a man having to provide a shed for his roots.
It wouldn’t do at all to have them in the same
room as we sleep in&mdash;they’d droop. I have a
beautiful big shed, and a snug stall for a donkey
in a corner of it; but he won’t bear tying up&mdash;he’ll
fight against tying all night, and if he was
loose, why in course he’d eat the flowers I put
in the shed. The price is nothing to him; he’d
eat the Queen’s camellias, if he could get at
them, if they cost a pound a-piece. So I have
a deal of trouble, for I must block him up
somehow; but he’s a first-rate ass.” To carry
on a considerable business, the services of a
man and his wife are generally required, as well
as those of a boy.</p>

<p>The purchases wholesale are generally by the
dozen roots, all ready for sale in pots. Mignonette,
however, is grown in boxes, and sold by
the box at from 5<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i>, according to the size,
&amp;c. The costermonger buys, for the large sale
to the poor, at a rate which brings the mignonette
roots into his possession at something less,
perhaps, than a halfpenny each. He then purchases
a gross of small common pots, costing
him 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a dozen, and has to transfer the roots
and soil to the pots, and then offer them for sale.
The profit thus is about 4<i>s.</i> per hundred, but
with the drawback of considerable labour and
some cost in the conveyance of the boxes. The
same method is sometimes pursued with young
stocks.</p>

<p>The cheapness of pots, I may mention incidentally,
and the more frequent sale of roots
in them, has almost entirely swept away the
fragment of a pitcher and “the spoutless tea-pot,”
which Cowper mentions as containing the
poor man’s flowers, that testified an inextinguishable
love of rural objects, even in the heart
of a city. There are a few such things, however,
to be seen still.</p>

<p>Of root-sellers there are, for six months of
the year, about 500 in London. Of these, one-fifth
devote themselves principally, but none
entirely, to the sale of roots; two-fifths sell
roots regularly, but only as a portion, and
not a larger portion of their business; and the
remaining two-fifths are casual dealers in
roots, buying them&mdash;almost always in the
markets&mdash;whenever a bargain offers. Seven-eighths
of the root-sellers are, I am informed,
regular costers, occasionally a gardener’s assistant
has taken to the street trade in flowers,
“but I fancy, sir,” said an experienced man
to me, “they’ve very seldom done any good
at it. They’re always <i>gardening</i> at their
roots, trimming them, and such like, and they
overdo it. They’re too careful of their plants;
people like to trim them theirselves.”</p>

<p>“I did well on fuschias last season,” said
one of my informants; “I sold them from
6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The ‘Globes’ went off well.
Geraniums was very fair. The ‘Fairy Queens’
of them sold faster than any, I think. It’s
the ladies out of town a little way, and a
few in town, that buy them, and buy the
fuschias too. They require a good window.
The ‘Jenny Linds’&mdash;they was geraniums and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
other plants&mdash;didn’t sell so well as the Fairy
Queens, though they was cheaper. Good cloves
(pinks) sell to the better sort of houses; so do
carnations. Mignonette’s everybody’s money.
Dahlias didn’t go off so well. I had very tidy
dahlias at 6<i>d.</i> and 1<i>s.</i>, and some 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I do a
goodish bit in giving flowers for old clothes. I
very seldom do it, but to ladies. I deal mostly
with them for their husbands’ old hats, or boots,
or shoes; yes, sir, and their trowsers and waistcoats
sometimes&mdash;very seldom their coats&mdash;and
ladies boots and shoes too. There’s one pleasant
old lady, and her two daughters, they’ll talk me
over any day. I very seldom indeed trade for
ladies’ clothes. I have, though. Mostly for
something in the shawl way, or wraps of some
kind. Why, that lady I was telling you of and
her daughters, got me to take togs that didn’t
bring the prime cost of my roots and expenses.
They called them by such fine names, that I
was had. Then they was so polite; ‘O, my
good man,’ says one of the young daughters, ‘I
must have this geranium in ’change.’ It was a
most big and beautiful Fairy Queen, well worth
4<i>s.</i> The tog&mdash;I didn’t know what they called
it&mdash;a sort of cloak, fetched short of half-a-crown,
and that just with cheaper togs. Some days, if
it’s very hot, and the stall business isn’t good in
<i>very</i> hot weather, my wife goes a round with me,
and does considerable in swopping with ladies.
They can’t do her as they can me. The same
on wet days, if it’s not very wet, when I has my
roots covered in the cart. Ladies is mostly at
home such times, and perhaps they’re dull, and
likes to go to work at a bargaining. My wife
manages them. In good weeks, I can clear 3<i>l.</i>
in my trade; the two of us can, anyhow. But
then there’s bad weather, and there’s sometimes
roots spoiled if they’re not cheap, and don’t go
off&mdash;but I’ll sell one that cost me 1<i>s.</i> for 2<i>d.</i> to
get rid of it; and there’s always the expenses to
meet, and the pony to keep, and everything that
way. No, sir, I don’t make 2<i>l.</i> a week for the
five months&mdash;its nearer five than six&mdash;the season
lasts; perhaps something near it. The rest of the
year I sell fruit, or anything, and may clear 10<i>s.</i>
or 15<i>s.</i> a week, but, some weeks, next to nothing,
and the expenses all going on.</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir; I can’t say that times is what
they was. Where I made 4<i>l.</i> on my roots five or
six years back, I make only 3<i>l.</i> now. But it’s no
use complaining; there’s lots worse off than I
am&mdash;lots. I’ve given pennies and twopences to
plenty that’s seen better days in the streets; it
might be their own fault. It is so mostly, but
perhaps only partly. I keep a connection together
as well as I can. I have a stall; my wife’s
there generally, and I go a round as well.”</p>

<p>One of the principal root-sellers in the streets
told me that he not unfrequently sold ten dozen
a day, over and above those sold not in pots. As
my informant had a superior trade, his business
is not to be taken as an average; but, reckoning
that he averages six dozen a day for 20 weeks&mdash;he
said 26&mdash;it shows that one man alone sells
8,640 flowers in pots in the season. The principal
sellers carry on about the same extent of
business.</p>

<p>According to similar returns, the number of
the several kinds of flowers in pots and flower
roots sold annually in the London streets, are
as follows:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Seeds.</span></h3>

<p>The street sale of seeds, I am informed, is
smaller than it was thirty, or even twenty years
back. One reason assigned for this falling off
is the superior cheapness of “flowers in pots.”
At one time, I was informed, the poorer classes
who were fond of flowers liked to “grow their
own mignonette.” I told one of my informants
that I had been assured by a trustworthy man,
that in one day he had sold 600 penny pots of
mignonette: “Not a bit of doubt of it, sir,”
was the answer, “not a doubt about it; I’ve
heard of more than that sold in a day by a man
who set on three hands to help him; and that’s
just where it is. When a poor woman, or poor
man either&mdash;but its mostly the women&mdash;can
buy a mignonette pot, all blooming and smelling
for 1<i>d.</i>, why she won’t bother to buy seeds and
set them in a box or a pot and wait for them
to come into full blow. Selling seeds in the
streets can’t be done so well now, sir. Anyhow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
it ain’t done as it was, as I’ve often heard
old folk say.” The reason assigned for this
is that cottages in many parts&mdash;such places
as Lisson-grove, Islington, Hoxton, Hackney,
or Stepney&mdash;where the inhabitants formerly
cultivated flowers in their little gardens, are
now let out in single apartments, and the
gardens&mdash;or yards as they mostly are now&mdash;were
used merely to hang clothes in. The
only green thing which remained in some of
these gardens, I was told, was horse-radish, a
root which it is difficult to extirpate: “And
it’s just the sort of thing,” said one man,
“that poor people hasn’t no great call for,
because they, you see, a’n’t not overdone with
joints of roast beef, nor rump steaks.” In the
suburbs where the small gardens are planted
with flowers, the cultivators rarely buy seeds
of the street-sellers, whose stands are mostly
at a distance.</p>

<p>None of the street seed-vendors confine themselves
to the sale. One man, whom I saw, told
me that last spring he was penniless, after
sickness, and a nurseryman, whom he knew,
trusted him 5<i>s.</i> worth of seeds, which he continued
to sell, trading in nothing else, for three
or four weeks, until he was able to buy some
flowers in pots. Though the profit is cent. per
cent. on most kinds, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day is accounted
“good earnings, on seeds.” On wet days there
is no sale, and, indeed, the seeds cannot be exposed
in the streets. My informant computed
that he cleared 5<i>s.</i> a week. His customers
were principally poor women, who liked to sow
mignonette in boxes, or in a garden-border, “if
it had ever such a little bit of sun,” and who
resided, he believed, in small, quiet streets,
branching off from the thoroughfares. Of flower-seeds,
the street-sellers dispose most largely
of mignonette, nasturtium, and the various
stocks; and of herbs, the most is done in
parsley. One of my informants, however, “did
best in grass-seeds,” which people bought, he
said, “to mend their grass-plots with,” sowing
them in any bare place, and throwing soil
loosely over them. Lupin, larkspur, convolvulus,
and Venus’s looking-glass had a fair sale.</p>

<p>The street-trade, in seeds, would be less than
it is, were it not that the dealers sell it in
smaller quantities than the better class of shop-keepers.
The street-traders buy their seeds by
the quarter of a pound&mdash;or any quantity not
considered retail&mdash;of the nurserymen, who often
write the names for the costers on the paper in
which the seed has to be inclosed. Seed that costs
4<i>d.</i>, the street-seller makes into eight penny
lots. “Why, yes, sir,” said one man, in answer
to my inquiry, “people is often afraid that our
seeds ain’t honest. If they’re not, they’re
mixed, or they’re bad, before they come into our
hands. I don’t think any of our chaps does
anything with them.”</p>

<p>Fourteen or fifteen years ago, although seeds,
generally, were fifteen to twenty per cent. dearer
than they are now, there was twice the demand
for them. An average price of good mignonette
seed, he said, was now 1<i>s.</i> the quarter of a pound,
and it was then 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The shilling’s
worth, is made, by the street-seller, into twenty
or twenty-four pennyworths. An average price
of parsley, and of the cheaper seeds, is less than
half that of mignonette. Other seeds, again, are
not sold to the street-people by the weight, but
are made up in sixpenny and shilling packages.
Their extreme lightness prevents their being
weighed to a customer. Of this class are, the
African marigold, the senecios (groundsel), and
the china-aster; but of these compound flowers,
the street-traders sell very few. Poppy-seed used
to be in great demand among the street-buyers,
but it has ceased to be so. “It’s a fine hardy
plant, too, sir,” I was told, “but somehow, for
all its variety in colours, it’s gone out of fashion,
for fashion runs strong in flowers.”</p>

<p>One long-established street-seller, who is well
known to supply the best seeds, makes for
the five weeks or so of the season more
than twice the weekly average of 5<i>s.</i>; perhaps
12<i>s.</i>; but as he is a shop as well as a stall-keeper,
he could not speak very precisely as to the
proportionate sale in the street or the shop.
This man laughed at the fondness some of his
customers manifested for “fine Latin names.”
“There are some people,” he said, “who will
buy antirrhinum, and artemisia, and digitalis,
and wouldn’t hear of snapdragon, or wormwood,
or foxglove, though they’re the identical
plants.” The same informant told me that
the railways in their approaches to the metropolis
had destroyed many small gardens, and
had, he thought, injured his trade. It was,
also, a common thing now for the greengrocers
and corn-chandlers to sell garden-seeds, which
until these six or eight years they did much less
extensively.</p>

<p>Last spring, I was told, there were not more
than four persons, in London, selling only seeds.
The “root-sellers,” of whom I have treated,
generally deal in seeds also, but the demand
does not extend beyond four or five weeks in the
spring, though there was “a straggling trade that
way” two or three weeks longer. It was computed
for me, that there were fully one hundred
persons selling seeds (with other things) in the
streets, and that each might average a profit of
5<i>s.</i> weekly, for a month; giving 200<i>l.</i> expended
in seeds, with 100<i>l.</i> profit to the costers. Seeds
are rarely hawked as flowers are.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give as minutely detailed
an account of the street-sale of seeds as of flowers,
as from their diversity in size, weight,
quantity in a pennyworth, &amp;c., no calculation
can be prepared by weight or measure, only by
<i>value</i>. Thus, I find it necessary to depart somewhat
from the order hitherto observed. One
seedsman, acquainted with the street-trade from
his dealings with the vendors, was of opinion
that the following list and proportions were as
nice an approximation as could be arrived at.
It was found necessary to give it in proportions
of twenty-fifths; but it must be borne in mind
that the <i>quantity</i> in 3/25ths of parsley, for exam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ple,
is more than double that of 3/25ths of mignonette.
I give, in unison, seeds of about equal
sale, whether of the same botanical family or
not. Many of the most popular flowers, such
as polyanthuses, daisies, violets, and primroses,
are not raised from seed, except in the nursery
<span class="lock">gardens:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of Christmasing&mdash;Laurel, Ivy, Holly,
and Mistletoe.</span></h3>

<p>In London a large trade is carried on in
“Christmasing,” or in the sale of holly and mistletoe,
for Christmas sports and decorations.
I have appended a table of the quantity of these
“branches” sold, nearly 250,000, and of the
money expended upon them in the streets.
It must be borne in mind, to account for this
expenditure for a brief season, that almost every
housekeeper will expend something in “Christmasing;”
from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the poor buy a
pennyworth, or a halfpennyworth each, and they
are the coster’s customers. In some houses,
which are let off in rooms, floors, or suites of
apartments, and not to the poorest class, every
room will have the cheery decoration of holly,
its bright, and as if <i>glazed</i> leaves and red berries,
reflecting the light from fire or candle. “Then,
look,” said a gardener to me, “what’s spent on
a Christmasing the churches! Why, now, properly
to Christmas St. Paul’s, I say <i>properly</i>,
mind, would take 50<i>l.</i> worth at least; aye, more,
when I think of it, nearer 100<i>l.</i> I hope there’ll
be no ‘No Popery’ nonsense against Christmasing
this year. I’m always sorry when anything of
that kind’s afloat, because it’s frequently a hindrance
to business.” This was said three weeks
before Christmas. In London there are upwards
of 300,000 inhabited houses. The whole of the
evergreen branches sold number 375,000.</p>

<p>Even the ordinary-sized inns, I was informed,
displayed holly decorations, costing from 2<i>s.</i>
to 10<i>s.</i>; while in the larger inns, where, perhaps,
an assembly-room, a concert-room, or a club-room,
had to be adorned, along with other
apartments, 20<i>s.</i> worth of holly, &amp;c., was a not
uncommon outlay. “Well, then, consider,”
said another informant, “the plum-puddings!
Why, at least there’s a hundred thousand of ’em
eaten, in London, through the Christmas and
the month following. That’s nearly one pudding
to every twenty of the population, is it,
sir? Well, perhaps, that’s too much. But,
then, there’s the great numbers eaten at
public dinners and suppers; and there’s more
plum-pudding clubs at the small grocers and
public-houses than there used to be, so, say
full a hundred thousand, flinging in any
mince-pies that may be decorated with evergreens.
Well, sir, every plum-pudding will
have a sprig of holly in him. If it’s bought
just for the occasion, it may cost 1<i>d.</i>, to be
really prime and nicely berried. If it’s part
of a lot, why it won’t cost a halfpenny, so
reckon it all at a halfpenny. What does that
come to? Above 200<i>l.</i> Think of that, then,
just for sprigging puddings!”</p>

<p>Mistletoe, I am informed, is in somewhat less
demand than it was, though there might be no
very perceptible difference. In many houses holly
is now used instead of the true plant, for the
ancient ceremonies and privileges observed
“under the mistletoe bough.” The holly is
not half the price of the mistletoe, which is one
reason; for, though there is not any great disparity
of price, wholesale, the holly, which
costs 6<i>d.</i> retail, is more than the quantity of
mistletoe retailed for 1<i>s.</i> The holly-tree may
be grown in any hedge, and ivy may be reared
against any wall; while the mistletoe is parasitical
of the apple-tree, and, but not to half the
extent, of the oak and other trees. It does not
grow in the northern counties of England. The
purchasers of the mistletoe are, for the most
part, the wealthier classes, or, at any rate, I was
told, “those who give parties.” It is bought,
too, by the male servants in large establishments,
and more would be so bought, “only so
few of the great people, of the most fashionable
squares and places, keep their Christmas in
town.” Half-a-crown is a not uncommon
price for a handsome mistletoe bough.</p>

<p>The costermongers buy about a half of the
holly, &amp;c., brought to the markets; it is also
sold either direct to those requiring evergreens,
or to green-grocers and fruiterers who have received
orders for it from their customers, or who
know it will be wanted. A shilling’s worth may
be bought in the market, the bundles being divided.
Mistletoe, the costers&mdash;those having
regular customers in the suburbs&mdash;receive orders
for. “Last December,” said a coster to me, “I
remember a servant-girl, and she weren’t such a
girl either, running after me in a regular flutter,
to tell me the family had forgot to order 2<i>s.</i> worth
of mistletoe of me, to be brought next day. Oh,
yes, sir, if it’s ordered by, or delivered to, the
servant-girls, they generally have a little giggling
about it. If I’ve said: ‘What are you laughing
at?’ they’ll mostly say: ‘Me! I’m not
laughing.’”</p>

<p>The costermongers go into the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>hood
of London to procure the holly for street-sale.
This is chiefly done, I was told, by
those who were “cracked up,” and some of
them laboured at it “days and days.” It is,
however, a very uncertain trade, as they must
generally trespass, and if they are caught
trespassing, by the occupier of the land, or
any of his servants, they are seldom “given in
charge,” but their stock of evergreens is not
unfrequently taken from them, “and that, sir,
that’s the cuttingest of all.” They do not
so freely venture upon the gathering of mistletoe,
for to procure it they must trespass in
orchards, which is somewhat dangerous work,
and they are in constant apprehension of traps,
spring-guns, and bull-dogs. Six or seven hundred
men or lads, the lads being the most
numerous, are thus employed for a week or
two before Christmas, and, perhaps, half that
number, irregularly at intervals, for a week or
two after it. Some of the lads are not known
as regular coster-lads, but they are <i>habitués</i> of
the streets in some capacity. To procure as
much holly one day, as will sell for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
next, is accounted pretty good work, and 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
would be thus realised in six days. But 5<i>s.</i> is
more frequently the return of six days’ labour
and sale, though a very few have cleared 10<i>s.</i>,
and one man, “with uncommon luck,” once
cleared 20<i>s.</i> in six days. The distance travelled
in a short winter’s day, is sometimes
twenty miles, and, perhaps, the lad or man has
not broken his fast, on some days, until the
evening, or even the next morning, for had he
possessed a few pence he would probably have
invested it in oranges or nuts, for street-sale,
rather than “go a-gathering Christmas.”</p>

<p>One strong-looking lad, of 16 or 17, gave me
the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It’s hard work, is Christmasing; but, when
you have neither money nor work, you must do
something, and so the holly may come in
handy. I live with a elder brother; he helps
the masons, and as we had neither of us either
work or money, he cut off Tottenham and Edmonton
way, and me the t’other side of the
water, Mortlake way, as well as I know. We’d
both been used to costering, off and on. I was
out, I think, ten days altogether, and didn’t
make 6<i>s</i>. in it. I’d been out two Christmases
before. O, yes, I’d forgot. I made 6<i>d.</i> over
the 6<i>s.</i>, for I had half a pork-pie and a pint of
beer, and the landlord took it out in holly. I
meant to have made a quarter of pork do, but
I was so hungry&mdash;and so would you, sir, if you’d
been out a-Christmasing&mdash;that I had the t’other
quarter. It’s 2<i>d.</i> a quarter. I did better when
I was out afore, but I forget what I made.
It’s often slow work, for you must wait sometimes
’till no one’s looking, and then you must
work away like anything. I’d nothing but a
sharp knife, I borrowed, and some bits of cord
to tie the holly up. You <i>must</i> look out sharp,
because, you see, sir, a man very likely won’t
like his holly-tree to be stripped. Wherever
there is a berry, we goes for the berries.
They’re poison berries, I’ve heard. Moonlight
nights is the thing, sir, when you knows
where you are. I never goes for mizzletoe.
I hardly knows it when I sees it. The first
time I was out, a man got me to go for some in
a orchard, and told me how to manage; but I
cut my lucky in a minute. Something came
over me like. I felt sickish. But what can a
poor fellow do? I never lost my Christmas,
but a little bit of it once. Two men took it
from me, and said I ought to thank them
for letting me off without a jolly good jacketing,
as they was gardeners. I believes they was
men out a-Christmasing, as I were. It was a
dreadful cold time that; and I was wet, and
hungry,&mdash;and thirsty, too, for all I was so wet,&mdash;and
I’d to wait a-watching in the wet. I’ve
got something better to do now, and I’ll never
go a-Christmasing again, if I can help it.”</p>

<p>This lad contrived to get back to his lodging,
in town, every night, but some of those out
Christmasing, stay two or three days and nights
in the country, sleeping in barns, out-houses,
carts, or under hay-stacks, inclement as the
weather may be, when their funds are insufficient
to defray the charge of a bed, or a part of
one, at a country “dossing-crib” (low lodging-house).
They resorted, in considerable numbers,
to the casual wards of the workhouses, in
Croydon, Greenwich, Reigate, Dartford, &amp;c.,
when that accommodation was afforded them,
concealing their holly for the night.</p>

<p>As in other matters, it may be a surprise to
some of my readers to learn in what way the
evergreens, used on festive occasions in their
homes, may have been procured.</p>

<p>The costermongers who procure their own
Christmasing, generally hawk it. A few sell it
by the lot to their more prosperous brethren.
What the costers purchase in the market, they
aim to sell at cent. per cent.</p>

<p>Supposing that 700 men and lads gathered
their own holly, &amp;c., and each worked for three
weeks (not regarding interruptions), and calculating
that, in the time they cleared even 15<i>s.</i>
each, it amounts to 525<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Some of the costermongers deck their carts
and barrows, in the general line, with holly at
Christmas. Some go out with their carts full
of holly, for sale, and may be accompanied by
a fiddler, or by a person beating a drum. The
cry is, “Holly! Green Holly!”</p>

<p>One of my informants alluded incidentally to
the decoration of the churches, and I may observe
that they used to be far more profusely
decked with Christmas evergreens than at present;
so much so, that a lady correspondent in
January, 1712, complained to “Mr. <i>Spectator</i>”
that her church-going was bootless. She was
constant at church, to hear divine service and
make conquests; but the clerk had so overdone
the greens in the church that, for three weeks,
Miss Jenny Simper had not even seen the young
baronet, whom she dressed at for divine worship,
although he pursued his devotions only
three pews from hers. The aisle was a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
shady walk, and each pew was an arbour. The
pulpit was so clustered with holly and ivy that
the congregation, like Moses, heard the word out
of a bush. “Sir Anthony Love’s pew in particular,”
concludes the indignant Miss Simper, “is
so well hedged, that all my batteries have no
effect. I am obliged to shoot at random among
the boughs without taking any manner of aim.
Mr. Spectator, unless you’ll give orders for removing
these greens, I shall grow a very awkward
creature at church, and soon have little
else to do there but to say my prayers.” In a
subsequent number, the clerk glorifies himself
that he had checked the ogling of Miss Simper.
He had heard how the Kentish men evaded
the Conqueror by displaying green boughs before
them, and so he bethought him of a like
device against the love-warfare of this coquettish
lady.</p>

<p>Of all the “branches” in the markets, the
costers buy one-half. This season, holly has
been cheaper than was ever known previously.
In some years, its price was double that cited, in
some treble, when the December was very frosty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sale of May, Palm, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of the May, the fragrant flower of the
hawthorn, a tree indigenous to this country&mdash;Wordsworth
mentions one which must have
been 800 years old&mdash;is carried on by the coster
boys (principally), but only in a desultory way.
The chief supply is brought to London in the
carts or barrows of the costers returning from a
country expedition. If the costermonger be
accompanied by a lad&mdash;as he always is if the
expedition be of any length&mdash;the lad will say
to his master, “Bill, let’s have some May to
take back.” The man will almost always consent,
and often assist in procuring the thickly
green branches with their white or rose-tinted,
and <i>freshly</i>-smelling flowers. The odour of the
hawthorn blossom is peculiar, and some eminent
botanist&mdash;Dr. Withering if I remember
rightly&mdash;says it may be best described as
“fresh.” No flower, perhaps, is blended with
more poetical, antiquarian, and beautiful associations
than the ever-welcome blossom of the
may-tree. One gardener told me that as the
hawthorn was in perfection in June instead of
May, the name was not proper. But it must
be remembered that the name of the flower
was given during the old style, which carried
our present month of May twelve days into
June, and the name would then be more appropriate.</p>

<p>The May is obtained by the costermongers in
the same way as the holly, by cutting it from
the trees in the hedges. It has sometimes to
be cut or broken off stealthily, for persons may
no more like their hawthorns to be stripped
than their hollies, and an ingenuous lad&mdash;as will
have been observed&mdash;told me of “people’s”
objections to the unauthorized stripping of their
holly-bushes. But there is not a quarter of the
difficulty in procuring May that there is in procuring
holly at Christmas.</p>

<p>The costermonger, if he has “done tidy”
in the country will very probably leave the
May at the disposal of his boy; but a few men,
though perhaps little more than twenty, I was
told, bring it on their own account. The lads
then carry the branches about for sale; or if a
considerable quantity has been brought, dispose
of it to other boys or girls, or entrust them with
the sale of it, at “half-profits,” or any terms
agreed upon. Costermongers have been known
to bring home “a load of May,” and this not
unfrequently, at the request, and for the benefit
of a “cracked-up” brother-trader, to whom it
has been at once delivered gratuitously.</p>

<p>A lad, whom I met with as he was selling
holly, told me that he had brought may from
the country when he had been there with a
coster. He had also gone out of town a few
miles to gather it on his own account.
“But it ain’t no good;” he said; “you must
often go a good way&mdash;I never knows anything
about how many miles&mdash;and if it’s very ripe
(the word he used) it’s soon shaken. There’s
no sure price. You may get 4<i>d.</i> for a big
branch or you must take 1<i>d.</i> I may have
made 1<i>s.</i> on a round but hardly ever more.
It can’t be got near hand. There’s some stunning
fine trees at the top of the park there (the
Regent’s Park) the t’other side of the ’logical
Gardens, but there’s always a cove looking
after them, they say, and both night and day.”</p>

<p>Palm, the flower of any of the numerous
species of the willow, is sold only on Palm
Sunday, and the Saturday preceding. The
trade is about equally in the hands of the
English and Irish lads, but the English lads
have a commercial advantage on the morning
of Palm Sunday, when so many of the Irish
lads are at chapel. The palm is all gathered
by the street-vendors. One costermonger told
me that when he was a lad, he had sold palm
to a man who had managed to get half-drunk
on a Sunday morning, and who told him that
he wanted it to show his wife, who very seldom
stirred out, that he’d been taking a healthful
walk into the country!</p>

<p>Lilac in flower is sold (and procured) in the
same way as May, but in small quantities.
Very rarely indeed, laburnum; which is too
fragile; or syringa, which, I am told, is hardly
saleable in the streets. One informant remembered
that forty years ago, when he was a boy,
branches of elder-berry flowers were sold in the
streets, but the trade has disappeared.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to form a calculation as
to the extent of this trade. The best informed
give me reason to believe that the sale of all
these branches (apart from Christmas) ranges,
according to circumstances, from 30<i>l.</i> to 50<i>l.</i>,
the cost being the labour of gathering, and
the subsistence of the labourer while at the
work. This is independent of what the costers
buy in the markets.</p>

<p>The quantity of branches “from other sources”
is that gathered by the costers in the way I have
described; but it is impossible to obtain a return
of it with proper precision: to state it as half of
that purchased in the markets is a low average.</p>

<p>I now give the amount paid by street-buyers
who indulge in the healthful and innocent tastes
of which I have been treating&mdash;the fondness for
the beautiful and the natural.</p>

<p>From the returns we find that of “cut
flowers” the roses retain their old English
favouritism, no fewer than 1,628,000 being
annually sold in the streets; but locality affects
the sale, as some dealers dispose of more violets
than roses, because violets are accounted less
fragile. The cheapness and hardihood of the
musk-plant and marigold, to say nothing of
their peculiar odour, has made them the most
popular of the “roots,” while the myrtle is the
favourite among the “trees and shrubs.” The
heaths, moreover, command an extensive sale,&mdash;a
sale, I am told, which was unknown, until
eight or ten years ago, another instance of the
“fashion in flowers,” of which an informant has
spoken.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="nobreak">STREET-SELLERS OF GREEN STUFF.</h2>
</div>


<p>Under this head I class the street-purveyors of
water-cresses, and of the chickweed, groundsel,
plantain, and turf required for cage-birds. These
purveyors seem to be on the outskirts, as it were,
of the costermonger class, and, indeed, the regular
costers look down upon them as an inferior
caste. The green-stuff trade is carried on by
very poor persons, and, generally, by children or
old people, some of the old people being lame,
or suffering from some infirmity, which, however,
does not prevent their walking about
with their commodities. To the children and
infirm class, however, the turf-cutters supply
an exception. The costermongers, as I have
intimated, do not resort, and do not let their
children resort, to this traffic. If reduced to
the last shift, they will sell nuts or oranges in
preference. The “old hands” have been “reduced,”
as a general rule, from other avocations.
Their homes are in the localities I have specified
as inhabited by the poor.</p>

<p>I was informed by a seller of birds, that he
thought fewer birds were kept by poor working-people,
and even by working-people who had
regular, though, perhaps, diminished earnings,
than was the case six or eight years ago. At
one time, it was not uncommon for a young man
to present his betrothed with a pair of singing-birds
in a neat cage; now such a present, as
far as my informant’s knowledge extended&mdash;and
he was a sharp intelligent man&mdash;was but rarely
made. One reason this man had often heard advanced
for poor persons not renewing their birds,
when lost or dead, is pitiful in its plainness&mdash;“they
eat too much.” I do not know, that, in such
a gift as I have mentioned, there was any intention
on the part of the lover to typify the beauty of
cheerfulness, even in a very close confinement
to home. “I can’t tell, sir,” was said to me,
“how it may have been originally, but I never
heard such a thing said much about, though
there’s been joking about the matter, as when
would the birds have young ones, and such like.
No, sir; I think it was just a fashion.” Contrary
to the custom in more prosperous establishments,
I am satisfied, that, among the
labouring classes, birds are more frequently the
pets of the men than of the women. My bird-dealing
informant cited merely his own experience,
but there is no doubt that cage-birds
are more extensively kept than ever in London;
consequently there is a greater demand for the
“green stuff” the birds require.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Watercress-selling, in Farringdon-market.</span></h3>

<p>The first coster-cry heard of a morning in the
London streets is that of “Fresh wo-orter-creases.”
Those that sell them have to be on
their rounds in time for the mechanics’ breakfast,
or the day’s gains are lost. As the stock-money
for this calling need only consist of a few
halfpence, it is followed by the very poorest of
the poor; such as young children, who have been
deserted by their parents, and whose strength is
not equal to any very great labour, or by old
men and women, crippled by disease or accident,
who in their dread of a workhouse life, linger
on with the few pence they earn by street-selling.</p>

<p>As winter draws near, the Farringdon cress-market
begins long before daylight. On your
way to the City to see this strange sight, the
streets are deserted; in the squares the blinds
are drawn down before the windows, and the
shutters closed, so that the very houses seem
asleep. All is so silent that you can hear the
rattle of the milkmaids’ cans in the neighbouring
streets, or the noisy song of three or four
drunken voices breaks suddenly upon you, as if
the singers had turned a corner, and then dies
away in the distance. On the cab-stands, but
one or two crazy cabs are left, the horses dozing
with their heads down to their knees, and the
drawn-up windows covered with the breath of
the driver sleeping inside. At the corners of the
streets, the bright fires of the coffee-stalls sparkle
in the darkness, and as you walk along, the
policeman, leaning against some gas-lamp, turns
his lantern full upon you, as if in suspicion that
one who walks abroad so early could mean no
good to householders. At one house there stands
a man, with dirty boots and loose hair, as if he
had just left some saloon, giving sharp single
knocks, and then going into the road and looking
up at the bed-rooms, to see if a light appeared
in them. As you near the City, you meet, if
it be a Monday or Friday morning, droves of
sheep and bullocks, tramping quietly along to
Smithfield, and carrying a fog of steam with
them, while behind, with his hands in his
pockets, and his dog panting at his heels, walks
the sheep-drover.</p>

<p>At the principal entrance to Farringdon-market
there is an open space, running the entire
length of the railings in front, and extending
from the iron gates at the entrance to the sheds
down the centre of the large paved court before
the shops. In this open space the cresses are
sold, by the salesmen or saleswomen to whom
they are consigned, in the hampers they are
brought in from the country.</p>

<p>The shops in the market are shut, the gaslights
over the iron gates burn brightly, and
every now and then you hear the half-smothered
crowing of a cock, shut up in some shed or bird-fancier’s
shop. Presently a man comes hurrying
along, with a can of hot coffee in each hand,
and his stall on his head, and when he has
arranged his stand by the gates, and placed his
white mugs between the railings on the stone
wall, he blows at his charcoal fire, making the
bright sparks fly about at every puff he gives.
By degrees the customers are creeping up, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in every style of rags; they shuffle up and down
before the gates, stamping to warm their feet,
and rubbing their hands together till they grate
like sandpaper. Some of the boys have brought
large hand-baskets, and carry them with the
handles round their necks, covering the head
entirely with the wicker-work as with a hood;
others have their shallows fastened to their
backs with a strap, and one little girl, with the
bottom of her gown tattered into a fringe like a
blacksmith’s apron, stands shivering in a large
pair of worn-out Vestris boots, holding in her
blue hands a bent and rusty tea-tray. A few
poor creatures have made friends with the coffee-man,
and are allowed to warm their fingers at
the fire under the cans, and as the heat strikes
into them, they grow sleepy and yawn.</p>

<p>The market&mdash;by the time we reach it&mdash;has
just begun; one dealer has taken his seat, and
sits motionless with cold&mdash;for it wants but a
month to Christmas&mdash;with his hands thrust deep
into the pockets of his gray driving coat. Before
him is an opened hamper, with a candle fixed
in the centre of the bright green cresses, and as
it shines through the wicker sides of the basket,
it casts curious patterns on the ground&mdash;as a
night shade does. Two or three customers, with
their “shallows” slung over their backs, and
their hands poked into the bosoms of their
gowns, are bending over the hamper, the light
from which tinges their swarthy features, and
they rattle their halfpence and speak coaxingly
to the dealer, to hurry him in their bargains.</p>

<p>Just as the church clocks are striking five,
a stout saleswoman enters the gates, and instantly
a country-looking fellow, in a wagoner’s
cap and smock-frock, arranges the baskets he
has brought up to London. The other ladies
are soon at their posts, well wrapped up in warm
cloaks, over their thick shawls, and sit with
their hands under their aprons, talking to the
loungers, whom they call by their names. Now
the business commences; the customers come in
by twos and threes, and walk about, looking at
the cresses, and listening to the prices asked.
Every hamper is surrounded by a black crowd,
bending over till their heads nearly meet, their
foreheads and cheeks lighted up by the candle
in the centre. The saleswomen’s voices are
heard above the noise of the mob, sharply
answering all objections that may be made to
the quality of their goods. “They’re rather
spotty, mum,” says an Irishman, as he examines
one of the leaves. “No more spots than a newborn
babe, Dennis,” answers the lady tartly, and
then turns to a new comer. At one basket, a
street-seller in an old green cloak, has spread
out a rusty shawl to receive her bunches, and
by her stands her daughter, in a thin cotton
dress, patched like a quilt. “Ah! Mrs. Dolland,”
cried the saleswoman in a gracious tone,
“can you keep yourself warm? it bites the
fingers like biling water, it do.” At another
basket, an old man, with long gray hair streaming
over a kind of policeman’s cape, is bitterly
complaining of the way he has been treated by
another saleswoman. “He bought a lot of her,
the other morning, and by daylight they were
quite white; for he only made threepence on
his best day.” “Well, Joe,” returns the lady,
“you should come to them as knows you, and
allers treats you well.”</p>

<p>These saleswomen often call to each other
from one end of the market to the other. If any
quarrel take place at one of the hampers, as
frequently it does, the next neighbour is sure
to say something. “Pinch him well, Sally,”
cried one saleswoman to another; “pinch him
well; <i>I</i> do when I’ve a chance.” “It’s no
use,” was the answer; “I might as well try to
pinch a elephant.”</p>

<p>One old wrinkled woman, carrying a basket
with an oilcloth bottom, was asked by a buxom
rosy dealer, “Now, Nancy, what’s for you?”
But the old dame was surly with the cold, and
sneering at the beauty of the saleswoman, answered,
“Why don’t you go and get a sweetheart;
sich as you aint fit for sich as we.” This
caused angry words, and Nancy was solemnly
requested “to draw it mild, like a good soul.”</p>

<p>As the morning twilight came on, the paved
court was crowded with purchasers. The sheds
and shops at the end of the market grew every
moment more distinct, and a railway-van,
laden with carrots, came rumbling into the
yard. The pigeons, too, began to fly on to the
sheds, or walk about the paving-stones, and
the gas-man came round with his ladder to turn
out the lamps. Then every one was pushing
about; the children crying, as their naked feet
were trodden upon, and the women hurrying
off, with their baskets or shawls filled with
cresses, and the bunch of rushes in their hands.
In one corner of the market, busily tying up
their bunches, were three or four girls seated on
the stones, with their legs curled up under them,
and the ground near them was green with the
leaves they had thrown away. A saleswoman,
seeing me looking at the group, said to me,
“Ah! you should come here of a summer’s
morning, and then you’d see ’em, sitting tying
up, young and old, upwards of a hundred poor
things as thick as crows in a ploughed field.”</p>

<p>As it grew late, and the crowd had thinned;
none but the very poorest of the cress-sellers
were left. Many of these had come without
money, others had their halfpence tied up carefully
in their shawl-ends, as though they dreaded
the loss. A sickly-looking boy, of about five,
whose head just reached above the hampers,
now crept forward, treading with his blue naked
feet over the cold stones as a cat does over wet
ground. At his elbows and knees, his skin
showed in gashes through the rents in his
clothes, and he looked so frozen, that the buxom
saleswoman called to him, asking if his mother
had gone home. The boy knew her well, for
without answering her question, he went up to
her, and, as he stood shivering on one foot,
said, “Give us a few old cresses, Jinney,” and
in a few minutes was running off with a green
bundle under his arm. All of the saleswomen
<span class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
seemed to be of kindly natures, for at another
stall an old dame, whose rags seemed to be
beyond credit, was paying for some cresses she
had long since been trusted with, and excusing
herself for the time that had passed since the
transaction. As I felt curious on the point
of the honesty of the poor, I asked the saleswoman
when she was alone, whether they lost
much by giving credit. “It couldn’t be much,”
she answered, “if they all of them decamped.”
But they were generally honest, and paid back,
often reminding her of credit given that she
herself had forgotten. Whenever she lost anything,
it was by the very very poor ones;
“though it aint their fault, poor things,” she
added in a kindly tone, “for when they keeps
away from here, it’s either the workhouse or the
churchyard as stops them.”</p>

<p>As you walk home&mdash;although the apprentice
is knocking at the master’s door&mdash;the little
water-cress girls are crying their goods in every
street. Some of them are gathered round the
pumps, washing the leaves and piling up the
bunches in their baskets, that are tattered and
worn as their own clothing; in some of the
shallows the holes at the bottom have been laced
up or darned together with rope and string, or
twigs and split laths have been fastened across;
whilst others are lined with oilcloth, or old pieces
of sheet-tin. Even by the time the cress-market
is over, it is yet so early that the maids are beating
the mats in the road, and mechanics, with
their tool-baskets swung over their shoulders, are
still hurrying to their work. To visit Farringdon-market
early on a Monday morning, is the
only proper way to judge of the fortitude and
courage and perseverance of the poor. As
Douglas Jerrold has beautifully said, “there is
goodness, like wild honey, hived in strange
nooks and corners of the earth.” These poor
cress-sellers belong to a class so poor that their
extreme want alone would almost be an excuse
for theft, and they can be trusted paying the
few pence they owe even though they hunger
for it. It must require no little energy of conscience
on the part of the lads to make them
resist the temptations around them, and refuse
the luring advice of the young thieves they meet
at the low lodging-house. And yet they prefer
the early rising&mdash;the walk to market with naked
feet along the cold stones&mdash;the pinched meal&mdash;and
the day’s hard labour to earn the few
halfpence&mdash;to the thief’s comparatively easy
life. The heroism of the unknown poor is
a thing to set even the dullest marvelling, and
in no place in all London is the virtue of the
humblest&mdash;both young and old&mdash;so conspicuous
as among the watercress-buyers at Farringdon-market.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Water-cress.</span></h3>

<p>The dealers in water-cresses are generally very
old or very young people, and it is a trade greatly
in the hands of women. The cause of this is,
that the children are sent out by their parents
“to get a loaf of bread somehow” (to use the
words of an old man in the trade), and the very
old take to it because they are unable to do hard
labour, and they strive to keep away from the
workhouse&mdash;(“I’d do anything before I’d go
there&mdash;sweep the crossings, or anything: but I
should have had to have gone to the house before,
if it hadn’t been for my wife. I’m sixty-two,”
said one who had been sixteen years at the trade).
The old people are both men and women. The
men have been sometimes one thing, and sometimes
another. “I’ve been a porter myself,” said
one, “jobbing about in the markets, or wherever I
could get a job to do. Then there’s one old man
goes about selling water-cresses who’s been a
seafaring man; he’s very old, he is&mdash;older than
what I am, sir. Many a one has been a good
mechanic in his younger days, only he’s got too
old for labour. The old women have, many of
them, been laundresses, only they can’t now do
the work, you see, and so they’re glad to pick
up a crust anyhow. Nelly, I know, has lost her
husband, and she hasn’t nothing else but her
few creases to keep her. She’s as good, honest,
hard-working a creature as ever were, for what
she can do&mdash;poor old soul! The young people
are, most of them, girls. There are some boys,
but girls are generally put to it by the poor
people. There’s Mary Macdonald, she’s about
fourteen. Her father is a bricklayer’s labourer.
He’s an Englishman, and he sends little Mary
out to get a halfpenny or two. He gets sometimes
a couple of days’ work in the week. He
don’t get more now, I’m sure, and he’s got three
children to keep out of that; so all on ’em that
can work are obligated to do something. The
other two children are so small they can’t do
nothing yet. Then there’s Louisa; she’s about
twelve, and she goes about with creases like I
do. I don’t think she’s got ne’er a father. I
know she’s a mother alive, and <i>she</i> sells creases
like her daughter. The mother’s about fifty odd,
I dare say. The sellers generally go about with
an arm-basket, like a greengrocer’s at their side,
or a ‘shallow’ in front of them; and plenty of
them carry a small tin tray before them, slung
round their neck. Ah! it would make your
heart ache if you was to go to Farringdon-market
early, this cold weather, and see the poor
little things there without shoes and stockings,
and their feet quite blue with the cold&mdash;oh, that
they are, and many on ’em don’t know how
to set one foot before the t’other, poor things.
You would say they wanted something give to
’em.”</p>

<p>The small tin tray is generally carried by the
young children. The cresses are mostly bought
in Farringdon-market: “The usual time to go
to the market is between five and six in the
morning, and from that to seven,” said one informant;
“myself, I am generally down in the
market by five. I was there this morning at five,
and bitter cold it was, I give you my word. We
poor old people feel it dreadful. Years ago I
didn’t mind cold, but I feel it now cruel bad, to
be sure. Sometimes, when I’m turning up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
things, I don’t hardly know whether I’ve got
’em in my hands or not; can’t even pick off a
dead leaf. But that’s nothing to the poor little
things without shoes. Why, bless you, I’ve
seen ’em stand and cry two and three together,
with the cold. Ah! my heart has ached for
’em over and over again. I’ve said to ’em, I
wonder why your mother sends you out, that I
have; and they said they was obligated to try
and get a penny for breakfast. We buy the
water-cresses by the ‘hand.’ One hand will
make about five halfpenny bundles. There’s
more call for ’em in the spring of the year than
what there is in the winter. Why, they’re
reckoned good for sweetening the blood in the
spring; but, for my own eating, I’d sooner
have the crease in the winter than I would
have it in the spring of the year. There’s an
old woman sits in Farringdon-market, of the
name of Burrows, that’s sot there twenty-four
years, and she’s been selling out creases to us
all that time.</p>

<p>“The sellers goes to market with a few pence.
I myself goes down there and lays out sometimes
my 4<i>d.</i>; that’s what I laid out this morning.
Sometimes I lay out only 2<i>d.</i> and 3<i>d.</i>,
according as how I has the halfpence in my
pocket. Many a one goes down to the market
with only three halfpence, and glad to have that
to get a halfpenny, or anything, so as to earn a
mouthful of bread&mdash;a bellyful that they can’t
get no how. Ah, many a time I walked through
the streets, and picked a piece of bread that the
servants chucked out of the door&mdash;may be to
the birds. I’ve gone and picked it up when I’ve
been right hungry. Thinks I, I can eat that as
well as the birds. None of the sellers ever goes
down to the market with less than a penny.
They won’t make less than a pennorth, that’s
one ‘hand,’ and if the little thing sells that, she
won’t earn more than three halfpence out of it.
After they have bought the creases they generally
take them to the pump to wet them. I
generally pump upon mine in Hatton-garden.
It’s done to make them look nice and fresh all
the morning, so that the wind shouldn’t make
them flag. You see they’ve been packed all
night in the hamper, and they get dry. Some
ties them up in ha’porths as they walks along.
Many of them sit down on the steps of St.
Andrew’s Church and make them up into
bunches. You’ll see plenty of them there of a
morning between five and six. Plenty, poor
little dear souls, sitting there,” said the old man
to me. There the hand is parcelled out into five
halfpenny bunches. In the summer the dealers
often go to market and lay out as much as 1<i>s.</i>
“On Saturday morning, this time of year, I
buys as many as nine hands&mdash;there’s more call
for ’em on Saturday and Sunday morning than
on any other days; and we always has to buy
on Saturdays what we want for Sundays&mdash;there
an’t no market on that day, sir. At the market
sufficient creases are bought by the sellers for
the morning and afternoon as well. In the
morning some begin crying their creases through
the streets at half-past six, and others about
seven. They go to different parts, but there is
scarcely a place but what some goes to&mdash;there
are so many of us now&mdash;there’s twenty to one
to what there used to be. Why, they’re so thick
down at the market in the summer time, that
you might bowl balls along their heads, and all
a fighting for the creases. There’s a regular
scramble, I can assure you, to get at ’em, so as
to make a halfpenny out of them. I should
think in the spring mornings there’s 400 or 500
on ’em down at Farringdon-market all at one
time&mdash;between four and five in the morning&mdash;if
not more than that, and as fast as they keep
going out, others keep coming in. I think
there is more than a thousand, young and old,
about the streets in the trade. The working
classes are the principal of the customers. The
bricklayers, and carpenters, and smiths, and
plumbers, leaving work and going home to
breakfast at eight o’clock, purchase the chief
part of them. A great many are sold down
the courts and mews, and bye streets, and
very few are got rid of in the squares and
the neighbourhood of the more respectable
houses. Many are sold in the principal
thoroughfares&mdash;a large number in the City.
There is a man who stands close to the Post-office,
at the top of Newgate-street, winter and
summer, who sells a great quantity of bunches
every morning. This man frequently takes
between 4<i>s.</i> and 5<i>s.</i> of a winter’s morning, and
about 10<i>s.</i> a day in the summer.” “Sixteen
years ago,” said the old man who gave me the
principal part of this information, “I could
come out and take my 18<i>s.</i> of a Saturday morning,
and 5<i>s.</i> on a Sunday morning as well; but
now I think myself very lucky if I can take my
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and it’s only on two mornings in the
week that I can get that.” The hucksters of
watercresses are generally an honest, industrious,
striving class of persons. The young
girls are said to be well-behaved, and to be the
daughters of poor struggling people. The old
men and women are persons striving to save
themselves from the workhouse. The old and
young people generally travel nine and ten
miles in the course of the day. They start off
to market at four and five, and are out on their
morning rounds from seven till nine, and on
their afternoon rounds from half-past two to five
in the evening. They travel at the rate of two
miles an hour. “If it wasn’t for my wife, I
must go to the workhouse outright,” said the
old watercress man. “Ah, I do’nt know what
I should do without her, I can assure you. She
earns about 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a day. She takes in a little
washing, and keeps a mangle. When I’m at
home I turn the mangle for her. The mangle
is my own. When my wife’s mother was alive
she lent us the money to buy it, and as we
earnt the money we paid her back so much a
week. It is <i>that</i> what has kept us together, or
else we shouldn’t have been as we are. The
mangle we give 50<i>s.</i> for, and it brings us in now
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a day with the washing. My wife is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
younger than I am. She is about thirty-five
years old. We have got two children. One is
thirteen and the other fifteen. They’ve both got
learning, and are both in situations. I always
sent ’em to school. Though I can’t neither
read nor write myself, I wished to make them
some little scholards. I paid a penny a week
for ’em at the school.   Lady M&mdash;&mdash; has always
given me my Christmas dinner for the last five
years, and God bless her for it&mdash;that I <i>do</i> say
indeed.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Watercress Girl.</span></h3>

<p>The little watercress girl who gave me the
following statement, although only eight years
of age, had entirely lost all childish ways, and
was, indeed, in thoughts and manner, a woman.
There was something cruelly pathetic in hearing
this infant, so young that her features had
scarcely formed themselves, talking of the bitterest
struggles of life, with the calm earnestness
of one who had endured them all. I did
not know how to talk with her. At first I
treated her as a child, speaking on childish subjects;
so that I might, by being familiar with
her, remove all shyness, and get her to narrate
her life freely. I asked her about her toys and
her games with her companions; but the look
of amazement that answered me soon put an
end to any attempt at fun on my part. I then
talked to her about the parks, and whether she
ever went to them. “The parks!” she replied
in wonder, “where are they?” I explained
to her, telling her that they were large open
places with green grass and tall trees, where
beautiful carriages drove about, and people
walked for pleasure, and children played. Her
eyes brightened up a little as I spoke; and
she asked, half doubtingly, “Would they let
such as me go there&mdash;just to look?” All her
knowledge seemed to begin and end with water-cresses,
and what they fetched. She knew no
more of London than that part she had seen on
her rounds, and believed that no quarter of the
town was handsomer or pleasanter than it was at
Farringdon-market or at Clerkenwell, where she
lived. Her little face, pale and thin with privation,
was wrinkled where the dimples ought to
have been, and she would sigh frequently. When
some hot dinner was offered to her, she would
not touch it, because, if she eat too much, “it
made her sick,” she said; “and she wasn’t
used to meat, only on a Sunday.”</p>

<p>The poor child, although the weather was
severe, was dressed in a thin cotton gown, with
a threadbare shawl wrapped round her shoulders.
She wore no covering to her head, and the long
rusty hair stood out in all directions. When she
walked she shuffled along, for fear that the
large carpet slippers that served her for shoes
should slip off her feet.</p>

<p>“I go about the streets with water-creases,
crying, ‘Four bunches a penny, water-creases.’
I am just eight years old&mdash;that’s all, and I’ve a
big sister, and a brother and a sister younger
than I am. On and off, I’ve been very near a
twelvemonth in the streets. Before that, I had
to take care of a baby for my aunt. No, it
wasn’t heavy&mdash;it was only two months old; but
I minded it for ever such a time&mdash;till it could
walk. It was a very nice little baby, not a very
pretty one; but, if I touched it under the chin,
it would laugh. Before I had the baby, I used
to help mother, who was in the fur trade; and,
if there was any slits in the fur, I’d sew them
up. My mother learned me to needle-work and
to knit when I was about five. I used to go to
school, too; but I wasn’t there long. I’ve forgot
all about it now, it’s such a time ago; and mother
took me away because the master whacked me,
though the missus use’n’t to never touch me. I
didn’t like him at all. What do you think? he
hit me three times, ever so hard, across the face
with his cane, and made me go dancing down
stairs; and when mother saw the marks on my
cheek, she went to blow him up, but she couldn’t
see him&mdash;he was afraid. That’s why I left
school.</p>

<p>“The creases is so bad now, that I haven’t
been out with ’em for three days. They’re so
cold, people won’t buy ’em; for when I goes up
to them, they say, ‘They’ll freeze our bellies.’
Besides, in the market, they won’t sell a ha’penny
handful now&mdash;they’re ris to a penny and tuppence.
In summer there’s lots, and ’most as
cheap as dirt; but I have to be down at Farringdon-market
between four and five, or else I
can’t get any creases, because everyone almost&mdash;especially
the Irish&mdash;is selling them, and
they’re picked up so quick. Some of the saleswomen&mdash;we
never calls ’em ladies&mdash;is very kind
to us children, and some of them altogether
spiteful. The good one will give you a bunch
for nothing, when they’re cheap; but the others,
cruel ones, if you try to bate them a farden less
than they ask you, will say, ‘Go along with you,
you’re no good.’ I used to go down to market
along with another girl, as must be about fourteen,
’cos she does her back hair up. When we’ve
bought a lot, we sits down on a door-step, and
ties up the bunches. We never goes home to
breakfast till we’ve sold out; but, if it’s very
late, then I buys a penn’orth of pudden, which
is very nice with gravy. I don’t know hardly
one of the people, as goes to Farringdon, to talk
to; they never speaks to me, so I don’t speak to
them. We children never play down there, ’cos
we’re thinking of our living. No; people never
pities me in the street&mdash;excepting one gentleman,
and he says, says he, ‘What do you do out so
soon in the morning?’ but he gave me nothink&mdash;he
only walked away.</p>

<p>“It’s very cold before winter comes on reg’lar&mdash;specially
getting up of a morning. I gets
up in the dark by the light of the lamp in the
court. When the snow is on the ground, there’s
no creases. I bears the cold&mdash;you must; so I
puts my hands under my shawl, though it hurts
’em to take hold of the creases, especially when
we takes ’em to the pump to wash ’em. No; I
never see any children crying&mdash;it’s no use.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I make a great deal of money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
One day I took 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the creases cost 6<i>d.</i>;
but it isn’t often I get such luck as that. I
oftener makes 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> than 1<i>s.</i>; and then I’m
at work, crying, ‘Creases, four bunches a penny,
creases!’ from six in the morning to about ten.
What do you mean by mechanics?&mdash;I don’t
know what they are. The shops buys most of
me. Some of ’em says, ‘Oh! I ain’t a-goin’ to
give a penny for these;’ and they want ’em at
the same price as I buys ’em at.</p>

<p>“I always give mother my money, she’s so
very good to me. She don’t often beat me; but,
when she do, she don’t play with me. She’s
very poor, and goes out cleaning rooms sometimes,
now she don’t work at the fur. I ain’t
got no father, he’s a father-in-law. No; mother
ain’t married again&mdash;he’s a father-in-law. He
grinds scissors, and he’s very good to me. No;
I dont mean by that that he says kind things to
me, for he never hardly speaks. When I gets
home, after selling creases, I stops at home. I
puts the room to rights: mother don’t make me
do it, I does it myself. I cleans the chairs,
though there’s only two to clean. I takes a tub
and scrubbing-brush and flannel, and scrubs the
floor&mdash;that’s what I do three or four times a
week.</p>

<p>“I don’t have no dinner. Mother gives me
two slices of bread-and-butter and a cup of tea
for breakfast, and then I go till tea, and has the
same. We has meat of a Sunday, and, of course,
I should like to have it every day. Mother has
just the same to eat as we has, but she takes
more tea&mdash;three cups, sometimes. No; I never
has no sweet-stuff; I never buy none&mdash;I don’t
like it. Sometimes we has a game of ‘honey-pots’
with the girls in the court, but not often.
Me and Carry H&mdash;&mdash; carries the little ’uns. We
plays, too, at ‘kiss-in-the-ring.’ I knows a good
many games, but I don’t play at ’em, ’cos going
out with creases tires me. On a Friday night,
too, I goes to a Jew’s house till eleven o’clock
on Saturday night. All I has to do is to snuff
the candles and poke the fire. You see they
keep their Sabbath then, and they won’t touch
anything; so they gives me my wittals and 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
and I does it for ’em. I have a reg’lar good lot
to eat. Supper of Friday night, and tea after
that, and fried fish of a Saturday morning, and
meat for dinner, and tea, and supper, and I like
it very well.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I’ve got some toys at home. I’ve
a fire-place, and a box of toys, and a knife and
fork, and two little chairs. The Jews gave ’em
to me where I go to on a Friday, and that’s why
I said they was very kind to me. I never had
no doll; but I misses little sister&mdash;she’s only
two years old. We don’t sleep in the same room;
for father and mother sleeps with little sister in
the one pair, and me and brother and other sister
sleeps in the top room. I always goes to
bed at seven, ’cos I has to be up so early.</p>

<p>“I am a capital hand at bargaining&mdash;but
only at buying watercreases. They can’t take
me in. If the woman tries to give me a small
handful of creases, I says, ‘I ain’t a goin’ to
have that for a ha’porth,’ and I go to the next
basket, and so on, all round. I know the
quantities very well. For a penny I ought to
have a full market hand, or as much as I could
carry in my arms at one time, without spilling.
For 3<i>d.</i> I has a lap full, enough to earn about
a shilling; and for 6<i>d.</i> I gets as many as crams
my basket. I can’t read or write, but I knows
how many pennies goes to a shilling, why,
twelve, of course, but I don’t know how many
ha’pence there is, though there’s two to a penny.
When I’ve bought 3<i>d.</i> of creases, I ties ’em up
into as many little bundles as I can. They
must look biggish, or the people won’t buy
them, some puffs them out as much as they’ll
go. All my money I earns I puts in a club
and draws it out to buy clothes with. It’s
better than spending it in sweet-stuff, for them
as has a living to earn. Besides it’s like a child
to care for sugar-sticks, and not like one who’s
got a living and vittals to earn. I aint a child,
and I shan’t be a woman till I’m twenty, but
I’m past eight, I am. I don’t know nothing
about what I earns during the year, I only
know how many pennies goes to a shilling, and
two ha’pence goes to a penny, and four fardens
goes to a penny. I knows, too, how many
fardens goes to tuppence&mdash;eight. That’s as
much as I wants to know for the markets.”</p>

<p>The discrepancy in the quantity sold in the
respective markets is to be accounted for by the
fact, that Farringdon is the water-cress market
to which are conveyed the qualities, large-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>leaved
and big-stalked, that suit the street-folk.
Of this description of cress they purchase one-half
of all that is sold in Farringdon; of the
finer, and smaller, and brown-leaved cress sold
there, they purchase hardly any. At Covent
Garden only the finer sorts of cress are in
demand, and, consequently, the itinerants buy
only an eighth in that market, and they are not
encouraged there. They purchase half the
quantity in the Borough, and the same in Spitalfields,
and a third at Portman. I have before
mentioned that 500 might be taken as the
number supported by the sale of “creases;”
that is, 500 families, or at least 1,000 individuals.
The total amount received is nearly
14,000<i>l.</i>, and this apportioned among 1,000
street-sellers, gives a weekly receipt of 5<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>,
with a profit of 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per individual.</p>

<p>The discrepancy is further accounted for
because the other market salesmen buy cresses
at Farringdon; but I have given under the head
of Farringdon <i>all</i> that is sold to those other
markets to be disposed to the street-sellers, and
the returns from the other markets are of the
cresses carried <i>direct</i> there, apart from any
purchases at Farringdon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Groundsel and Chickweed Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>On a former occasion (in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>)
I mentioned that I received a letter informing
me that a woman, residing in one of the
courts about Saffron-hill, was making braces,
and receiving only 1<i>s.</i> for four dozen of them. I
was assured she was a most deserving character,
strictly sober, and not receiving parochial relief.
“Her husband,” my informant added, “was
paralysed, and endeavoured to assist his family
by gathering green food for birds. They are in
deep distress, but their character is irreproachable.”
I found the couple located up a court,
the entrance to which was about as narrow as
the opening to a sentry-box, and on each side
lolled groups of labourers and costermongers,
with short black pipes in their mouths. As I
dived into the court, a crowd followed me to see
whither I was going. The brace-maker lived
on the first floor of a crazy, fœtid house. I
ascended the stairs, and the banisters, from
which the rails had all been purloined, gave
way in my hands. I found the woman, man,
and their family busy at their tea-dinner. In
a large broken chair, beside the fire-place, was
the old paralysed man, dressed in a ragged
greasy fustian coat, his beard unshorn, and his
hair in the wildest disorder. On the edge of
the bed sat a cleanly looking woman, his wife,
with a black apron on. Standing by the table
was a blue-eyed laughing and shoeless boy,
with an old camlet cape pinned over his shoulders.
Next him was a girl in a long grey pinafore,
with her hair cut close to her head, with
the exception of a few locks in front, which
hung down over her forehead like a dirty fringe.
On a chair near the window stood a basket half
full of chickweed and groundsel, and two large
cabbages. There was a stuffed linnet on the
mantel-piece and an empty cage hanging outside
the window. In front of the window-sill
was the small imitation of a gate and palings,
so popular among the workpeople. On the
table were a loaf, a few mugs of milkless tea
and a small piece of butter in a saucer. I had
scarcely entered when the mother began to remove
the camlet cape from the boy’s shoulders,
and to slip a coarse clean pinafore over his
head instead. At present I have only to deal
with the trade of the husband, who made the
following statement:</p>

<p>“I sell chickweed and grunsell, and turfs
for larks. That’s all I sell, unless it’s a few
nettles that’s ordered. I believe they’re for tea,
sir. I gets the chickweed at Chalk Farm. I
pay nothing for it. I gets it out of the public
fields. Every morning about seven I goes for
it. The grunsell a gentleman gives me leave
to get out of his garden: that’s down Battle-bridge
way, in the Chalk-road, leading to Holloway.
I gets there every morning about nine.
I goes there straight. After I have got my chickweed,
I generally gathers enough of each to make
up a dozen halfpenny bunches. The turfs I
buys. A young man calls here with them. I
pay 2<i>d.</i> a dozen for ’em to him. He gets them
himself. Sometimes he cuts ’em at Kilburn
Wells; and Notting-hill he goes to sometimes,
I believe. He hires a spring barrow, weekly,
to take them about. He pays 4<i>d.</i> a day, I believe,
for the barrow. He sells the turfs to the
bird-shops, and to such as me. He sells a
few to some private places. I gets the nettles
at Highgate. I don’t do much in the nettle
line&mdash;there ain’t much call for it. After I’ve
gathered my things I puts them in my basket,
and slings ’em at my back, and starts round
London. Low Marrabun I goes to always of a
Saturday and Wednesday. I goes to St. Pancras
on a Tuesday. I visit Clerkenwell, and
Russell-square, and round about there, on a
Monday. I goes down about Covent-garden
and the Strand on a Thursday. I does High
Marrabun on a Friday, because I aint able to
do so much on that day, for I gathers my stuff
on the Friday for Saturday. I find Low Marrabun
the best of my beats. I cry ‘chickweed
and grunsell’ as I goes along. I don’t say ‘for
young singing birds.’ It is usual, I know, but
<i>I</i> never did. I’ve been at the business about
eighteen year. I’m out in usual till about five
in the evening. I never stop to eat. I’m walking
all the time. I has my breakfast afore I
starts, and my tea when I comes home.” Here
the woman shivered. I turned round and found
the fire was quite out. I asked them whether
they usually sat without one. The answer was,
“We most generally raise a pennyworth, some
how, just to boil the kettle with.” I inquired
whether she was cold, and she assured me she
wasn’t. “It was the blood,” she said, “that
ran through her like ice sometimes.” “I am a
walking ten hours every day&mdash;wet or dry,” the
man continued. “I don’t stand nice much
about that. I can’t go much above one mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and a half an hour, owing to my right side being
paralysed. My leg and foot and all is
quite dead. I goes with a stick.” [The wife
brought the stick out from a corner of the room
to show me. It was an old peculiarly carved
one, with a bird rudely cut out of wood for the
handle, and a snake twisting itself up the stick.]
“I walk fifteen miles every day of my life, that
I do&mdash;quite that&mdash;excepting Sunday, in course.
I generally sell the chickweed and grunsell and
turfs, all to the houses, not to the shops. The
young man as cut the turf gathers grunsell as
well for the shops. They’re tradespeople and
gentlefolks’ houses together that I sells to&mdash;such
as keeps canaries, or goldfinches, or linnets. I
charge &frac12;<i>d.</i> a bunch for chickweed and grunsell
together. It’s the regular charge. The nettles
is ordered in certain quantities; I don’t get
them unless they’re ordered: I sells these in
three-pennn’orths at a time. Why, Saturday
is my best day, and that’s the reason why I
can’t spare time to gather on that day. On
Saturday I dare say I gets rid on two dozen
bunches of chickweed and grunsell. On the
other days, sometimes, I goes out and don’t sell
above five or six bunches; at other times I get
rid on a dozen; that I call a tidy day’s work
for any other day but a Saturday, and some days
I don’t sell as much as a couple of bunches in
the whole day. Wednesday is my next best day
after Saturday. On a Wednesday, sometimes,
I sell a dozen and a half. In the summer I
does much better than in winter. They gives
it more to the birds then, and changes it oftener.
I’ve seed a matter of eight or nine people that
sell chickweed and grunsell like myself in the
fields where I goes to gather it. They mostly
all goes to where I do to get mine. They are
a great many that sells grunsell about the streets
in London, like I do. I dare say there is a
hundred, and far more nor that, taking one place
with another. I takes my nettles to ladies’
houses. They considers the nettles good for the
blood, and drinks ’em at tea, mostly in the
spring and autumn. In the spring I generally
sells three threepenn’orths of ’em a week, and
in the autumn about two threepenn’orths. The
ladies I sell the nettles to are mostly sickly, but
sometimes they aint, and has only a breaking out
in the skin, or in their face. The nettles are
mostly taken in Low Marrabun. I gathers
more than all for Great Titchfield-street. The
turfs I sell mostly in London-street, in Marrabun
and John-street, and Carburton-street, and
Portland-street, and Berners, and all about
there. I sells about three dozen of turfs a
week. I sells them at three and four a penny.
I charges them at three a penny to gentlefolks
and four a penny to tradespeople. I pays 2<i>d.</i> a
dozen for ’em and so makes from 1<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> a
dozen out of ’em. I does trifling with these in
the winter&mdash;about two dozen a week, but always
three dozen in the summer. Of the chickweed
and grunsell I sells from six to seven dozen
bunches a week in the summer, and about four
or five dozen bunches in the winter. I sells
mostly to regular customers, and a very few to
chance ones that meet me in the street. The
chance customers come mostly in the summer
times. Altogether I should say with my regular
and chance customers I make from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>
a week in the summer, and from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> in the
winter. That’s as near as I can tell. Last Monday
I was out all day, and took 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; Tuesday
I took about 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>; Wednesday I got 9&frac12;<i>d.</i>;
Thursday I can’t hardly recollect, not to tell
the truth about it. But oh, dear me, yes I
wasn’t allowed to go out on that day. We was
given to understand nothing was allowed to be
sold on that day. They told us it were the
Thanksgiving-day. I was obliged to fast on
that day. We did have a little in the morning,
a trifle, but not near enough. Friday I came
home with nigh upon 6<i>d.</i>, and Saturday I got
1<i>s.</i>, and 3<i>d.</i> after when I went out at night. I
goes into Leather-lane every Saturday night, and
stands with my basket there, so that altogether,
last week I made 3<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> But that was a slack
week with me, owing to my having lost Thursday.
If it hadn’t been for that I should have
made near upon 4<i>s.</i> We felt the loss very
severely. Prices have come down dreadful
with us. The same bunches as I sell now for
&frac12;<i>d.</i> I used to get 1<i>d.</i> for nine or ten years ago.
I dare say I could earn then, take one day with
another, such a thing as 7<i>s.</i> a week, summer
and winter through. There’s so many at it
now to what there was afore, that it’s difficult
to get a living, and the ladies are very hard with
a body. They tries to beat me down, and particular
in the matter of turfs. They tell me
they can buy half-a-dozen for 1<i>d.</i>, so I’m obligated
to let ’em have three or four. There’s a
many women at the business. I hardly know
which is the most, men or women. There’s
pretty nigh as much of one as the other, I
think. I am a bed-sacking weaver by trade.
When I worked at it I used to get 15<i>s.</i> a week
regularly. But I was struck with paralysis
nearly nineteen years ago, and lost the use of
all one side, so I was obleeged to turn to summut
else. Another grunseller told me on the
business, and what he got, and I thought I
couldn’t do no better. That’s a favourite linnet.
We had that one stuffed there. A young man
that I knew stuffed it for me. I was very sorry
when the poor thing died. I’ve got another
little linnet up there.” “I’m particular fond
of little birds,” said the wife. “I never was
worse off than I am now. I pays 2<i>s.</i> a week
rent, and we has, take one time with another,
about 3<i>s.</i> for the four of us to subsist upon for
the whole seven days; yes, that, take one time
with another, is generally what I do have. We
very seldom has any meat. This day week we
got a pound of pieces. I gave 4<i>d.</i> for ’em.
Everything that will pledge I’ve got in pawn.
I’ve been obliged to let them go. I can’t
exactly say how much I’ve got in pledge, but
you can see the tickets.” [The wife brought
out a tin box full of duplicates. They were for
the usual articles&mdash;coats, shawls, shirts, sheets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
handkerchiefs, indeed almost every article of
wearing-apparel and bedding. The sums lent
were mostly 6<i>d.</i> and 9<i>d.</i>, while some ran as high
as 2<i>s.</i> The dates of many were last year, and
these had been backed for three months.]
“I’ve been paying interest for many of the
things there for seven years. I pay for the
backing 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, that is 1<i>d.</i> for the backing, and
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> for the three months’ interest. I pay 6<i>d.</i> a
year interest on every one of the tickets. If its
only 3<i>d.</i>, I have to pay &frac12;<i>d.</i> a month interest just
the same, but nothing for the ticket when we
put it in.” The number of duplicates was 26,
and the gross sum amounted to 1<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> One
of the duplicates was for 4<i>d.</i>; nine were for 6<i>d.</i>,
two for 9<i>d.</i>, nine were for 1<i>s.</i>, two for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
one for 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, one for 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> and two for 2<i>s.</i>
“The greatest comfort I should like to have
would be something more on our beds. We
lay dreadful cold of a night, on account of
being thin clad. I have no petticoats at all.
We have no blankets&mdash;of late years I haven’t
had any. The warm clothing would be the
greatest blessing I could ask. I’m not at all
discontented at my lot. That wouldn’t mend
it. We strive and do the best we can, and may
as well be contented over it. I think its God’s
will we should be as we are. Providence is
kind to me, even badly off as we are. I know
it’s all for the best.”</p>

<p>There are no “pitches,” or stands, for the
sale of groundsel in the streets; but, from the
best information I could acquire, there are now
1,000 itinerants selling groundsel, each person
selling, as an average, 18 bunches a day. We
thus have 5,616,000 bunches a year, which, at
&frac12;<i>d.</i> each, realise 11,700<i>l.</i>&mdash;about 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per week
per head of sellers of groundsel. The “oldest
hand” in the trade is the man whose statement
and likeness I give. The sale continues
through the year, but “the groundsel” season
extends from April to September; in those
months 24 bunches, per individual seller, is the
extent of the traffic, in the other months half
that quantity, giving the average of 18 bunches.</p>

<p>The capital required for groundsel-selling is
4<i>d.</i> for a brown wicker-basket; leather strap to
sling it from the shoulder, 6<i>d.</i>; in all, 10<i>d.</i> No
knife is necessary; they pluck the groundsel.</p>

<p>Chickweed is only sold in the summer, and is
most generally mixed with groundsel and plantain.
The chickweed and plantain, together, are
but half the sale of groundsel, and that only for
five months, adding, to the total amount, 2,335<i>l.</i>
But this adds little to the profits of the regular
itinerants; for, when there is the best demand,
there are the greatest number of sellers, who in
winter seek some other business. The total
amount of “green stuff” expended upon birds,
as supplied by the street-sellers, I give at the
close of my account of the trade of those purveyors.</p>

<p>Many of the groundsel and chickweed-sellers&mdash;for
the callings are carried on together&mdash;who
are aged men, were formerly brimstone-match
sellers, who “didn’t like to take to the lucifers.”</p>

<p>On the publication of this account in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, several sums were forwarded
to the office of that journal for the benefit of
this family. These were the means of removing
them to a more comfortable home, of redeeming
their clothing, and in a measure realizing the
wishes of the poor woman.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Turf Cutting and Selling.</span></h3>

<p>A man long familiar with this trade, and who
knew almost every member of it individually,
counted for me 36 turf-cutters, to his own knowledge,
and was confident that there were 40 turf-cutters
and 60 sellers in London; the addition
of the sellers, however, is but that of 10 women,
who assist their husbands or fathers in the street
sales,&mdash;but no women cut turf,&mdash;and of 10 men
who sell, but buy of the cutters.</p>

<p>The turf is simply a sod, but it is considered
indispensable that it should contain the leaves
of the “small Dutch clover,” (the shamrock of
the Irish), the most common of all the trefoils.
The turf is used almost entirely for the food and
roosting-place of the caged sky-larks. Indeed
one turf-cutter said to me: “It’s only people
that don’t understand it that gives turf to other
birds, but of course if we’re asked about it, we
say it’s good for every bird, pigeons and chickens
and all; and very likely it is if they choose to
have it.” The principal places for the cutting
of turf are at present Shepherd’s Bush, Notting
Hill, the Caledonian Road, Hampstead, Highgate,
Hornsey, Peckham, and Battersea. Chalk
Farm was an excellent place, but it is now
exhausted, “fairly flayed” of the shamrocks.
Parts of Camden Town were also fertile in turf,
but they have been built over. Hackney was a
district to which the turf-cutters resorted, but
they are now forbidden to cut sods there. Hampstead
Heath used to be another harvest-field for
these turf-purveyors, but they are now prohibited
from “so much as sticking a knife into the
Heath;” but turf-cutting is carried on surreptitiously
on all the outskirts of the Heath, for
there used to be a sort of feeling, I was told,
among some real Londoners that Hampstead
Heath yielded the best turf of any place. All
the “commons” and “greens,” Paddington,
Camberwell, Kennington, Clapham, Putney, &amp;c.
are also forbidden ground to the turf-cutter.
“O, as to the parks and Primrose Hill itself&mdash;round
about it’s another thing&mdash;nobody,” it was
answered to my inquiry, “ever thought of cutting
their turf there. The people about, if they
was only visitors, wouldn’t stand it, and right
too. I wouldn’t, if I wasn’t in the turf-cutting
myself.”</p>

<p>The places where the turf is principally cut
are the fields, or plots, in the suburbs, in which
may be seen a half-illegible board, inviting the
attention of the class of speculating builders to
an “eligible site” for villas. Some of these
places are open, and have long been open, to
the road; others are protected by a few crazy
rails, and the turf-cutters consider that outside
the rails, or between them and the road, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
have a <i>right</i> to cut turf, unless forbidden by the
police. The fact is, that they cut it on sufferance;
but the policeman never interferes, unless required
to do so by the proprietor of the land or
his agent. One gentleman, who has the control
over a considerable quantity of land “eligible”
for building, is very inimical to the pursuits of
the turf-cutters, who, of course, return his hostility.
One man told me that he was required,
late on a Saturday night, some weeks ago, to
supply six dozen of turfs to a very respectable
shopkeeper, by ten or eleven on the Sunday
morning. The shopkeeper had an aristocratic
connection, and durst not disappoint his customers
in their demands for fresh turf on the Sunday,
so that the cutter must supply it. In
doing so, he encountered Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (the gentleman
in question), who was exceedingly angry
with him: “You d&mdash;d poaching thief!” said
the gentleman, “if this is the way you pass your
Sunday, I’ll give you in charge.” One turf-cutter,
I was informed, had, within these eight
years, paid 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> fines for trespassing, besides
losing his barrow, &amp;c., on every conviction:
“But he’s a most outdacious fellor,” I was told
by one of his mates, “and won’t mind spoiling
anybody’s ground to save hisself a bit of trouble.
There’s too many that way, which gives us a bad
name.” Some of the managers of the land to be
built upon give the turf-cutters free leave to
labour in their vocation; others sell the sods for
garden-plots, or use them to set out the gardens
to any small houses they may be connected
with, and with them the turf-cutters have no
chance of turning a sod or a penny.</p>

<p>I accompanied a turf-cutter, to observe the
manner of his work. We went to the neighbourhood
of Highgate, which we reached a little
before nine in the morning. There was nothing
very remarkable to be observed, but the scene
was not without its interest. Although it was
nearly the middle of January, the grass was
very green and the weather very mild. There
happened to be no one on the ground but my
companion and myself, and in some parts of our
progress nothing was visible but green fields
with their fringe of dark-coloured leafless trees;
while in other parts, which were somewhat more
elevated, glimpses of the crowded roof of an
omnibus, or of a line of fleecy white smoke,
showing the existence of a railway, testified to
the neighbourhood of a city; but no sound was
heard except, now and then, a distant railway
whistle. The turf-cutter, after looking carefully
about him&mdash;the result of habit, for I was told
afterwards, by the policeman, that there was no
trespass&mdash;set rapidly to work. His apparatus
was a sharp-pointed table-knife of the ordinary
size, which he inserted in the ground, and made
it rapidly describe a half-circle; he then as
rapidly ran his implement in the opposite half-circle,
flung up the sod, and, after slapping it
with his knife, cut off the lower part so as to
leave it flat&mdash;working precisely as does a butcher
cutting out a joint or a chop, and reducing the
fat. Small holes are thus left in the ground&mdash;of
such shape and size as if deep saucers were
to be fitted into them&mdash;and in the event of a
thunder-shower in droughty weather, they become
filled with water, and have caused a puzzlement,
I am told, to persons taking their quiet
walk when the storm had ceased, to comprehend
why the rain should be found to gather in little
circular pools in some parts, and not in others.</p>

<p>The man I accompanied cut and shaped six
of these turfs in about a minute, but he worked
without intermission, and rather to show me
with what rapidity and precision he could cut,
than troubling himself to select what was saleable.
After that we diverged in the direction
of Hampstead; and in a spot not far from a
temporary church, found three turf-cutters at
work,&mdash;but they worked asunder, and without
communication one with another. The turfs, as
soon as they are cut and shaped, are thrown into
a circular basket, and when the basket is full
it is emptied on to the barrow (a costermonger’s
barrow), which is generally left untended at the
nearest point: “We can trust one another, as
far as I know,” said one turf-man to me, “and
nobody else would find it worth while to steal
turfs.” The largest number of men that my
most intelligent informant had ever seen at work
in one locality was fourteen, and that was in a
field just about to be built over, and “where
they had leave.” Among the turf-purveyors
there is no understanding as to where they are
to “cut.” Wet weather does not interfere with
turf procuring; it merely adds to the weight,
and consequently to the toil of drawing the
barrow. Snow is rather an advantage to the
street-seller, as purchasers are apt to fancy that
if the storm continues, turfs will not be obtainable,
and so they buy more freely. The turf-man
clears the snow from the ground in any
known locality&mdash;the cold pinching his ungloved
hands&mdash;and cuts out the turf, “as green,” I was
told, “as an April sod.” The weather most
dreaded is that when hoar frost lies long and
heavy on the ground, for the turf cut with the
rime upon it soon turns black, and is unsaleable.
Foggy dark weather is also prejudicial, “for
then,” one man said, “the days clips it uncommon
short, and people won’t buy by candlelight,
no more will the shops. Birds has gone to sleep
then, and them that’s fondest on them says,
‘We can get fresher turf to-morrow.’” The
gatherers cannot work by moonlight; “for the
clover leaves then shuts up,” I was told by one
who said he was a bit of a botanist, “like the
lid of a box, and you can’t tell them.”</p>

<p>One of my informants told me that he cut
25 dozen turfs every Friday (the great working
turf-day) of the year on an average (he sometimes
cut on that day upwards of 30 dozen);
17 dozen on a Tuesday; and 6 dozen on the
other days of the week, more or less, as the
demand justified&mdash;but 6 dozen was an average.
He had also cut a few turfs on a Sunday morning,
but only at long intervals, sometimes only
thrice a year. Thus one man will cut 2,496
dozen, or 29,952 turfs in a year, not reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the product of any Sunday. From the best
information I could acquire, there seems no
doubt but that one-half of the turf-cutters (20)
exert a similar degree of industry to that detailed;
and the other 20 procure a moiety of the
quantity cut and disposed of by their stronger
and more fortunate brethren. This gives an
aggregate, for an average year, of 598,560 turfs,
or including Sunday turf-cutting, of 600,000.
Each turf is about 6 inches diameter at the
least; so that the whole extent of turf cut for
London birds yearly, if placed side by side,
would extend fifty-six miles, or from London to
Canterbury.</p>

<p>In wet weather, 6 dozen turfs weigh, on an
average, 1 cwt.; in dry weather, 8 dozen weigh
no more; if, therefore, we take 7 dozen as the
usual hundred-weight, a turf-cutter of the best
class carries, in basket-loads, to his barrow, and
when his stock is completed, drags into town
from the localities I have specified, upwards
of 3&frac12; cwt. every Friday, nearly 2&frac12; every Tuesday,
and about 7 cwt. in the course of a week;
the smaller traders drag half the quantity,&mdash;and
the total weight of turf disposed of for the cage-birds
of London, every year, is 546 tons.</p>

<p>Of the supply of turf, obtained as I have
described, at least three-fourths is sold to the
bird-shops, who retail it to their customers. The
price paid by these shopkeepers to the labourers
for their turf trade is 2<i>d.</i> and 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> a dozen, but
rarely 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> They retail it at from 3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
a dozen, according to connection and locality.
The remainder is sold by the cutters on their
rounds from house to house, at two and three a
penny.</p>

<p>None of the turf-cutters confine themselves
to it. They sell in addition groundsel, chickweed,
plaintain, very generally; and a few supply
nettles, dandelion, ground-ivy, snails, worms,
frogs, and toads. The sellers of groundsel and
chickweed are far more numerous, as I have
shown, than the turf-cutters&mdash;indeed many of
them are incapable of cutting turf or of dragging
the weight of the turfs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience and Customers of
a Turf-Cutter.</span></h3>

<p>A short but strongly-built man, of about thirty,
with a very English face, and dressed in a
smock-frock, wearing also very strong unblacked
boots, gave me the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My father,” he said, “was in the Earl of
&mdash;&mdash;’s service, and I was brought up to stable-work.
I was employed in a large coaching inn,
in Lancashire, when I was last employed in
that way, but about ten years ago a railway line
was opened, and the coaching was no go any
longer; it hadn’t a chance to pay, so the horses
and all was sold, and I was discharged with a
lot of others. I walked from Manchester to
London&mdash;for I think most men when they don’t
know what in the world to do, come to London&mdash;and
I lived a few months on what little money
I had, and what I could pick up in an odd job
about horses. I had some expectations when
I came up that I might get something to do
through my lord, or some of his people&mdash;they
all knew me: but my lord was abroad, and his
establishment wasn’t in town, and I had to
depend entirely on myself. I was beat out three
or four times, and didn’t know what to do, but
somehow or other I got over it. At last&mdash;it’s
between eight and nine years ago&mdash;I was fairly
beat out. I was taking a walk&mdash;I can’t say just
now in what way I went, for it was all one
which way&mdash;but I remember I saw a man cutting
turf, and I remembered then that a man
that lived near me lived pretty middling by
turf-cutting. So I watched how it was done,
and then I inquired how I could get into it, and
as I’d paid my way I could give reference to
show I might be trusted; so I got a barrow on
hire, and a basket, and bought a knife for 3<i>d.</i> at
a marine-shop, and set to work. At first I only
supplied shops, but in a little time I fell into a
private round, and that pays better. I’ve been
at it almost every day, I may say, ever since.
My best customers are working people that’s
fond of birds; they’re far the best. It’s the
ready penny with them, and no grumbling.
I’ve lost money by trusting noblemen; of course
I blame their servants. You’d be surprised, sir,
to hear how often at rich folks’ houses, when
they’ve taken their turf or what they want,
they’ll take credit and say, ‘O, I’ve got no
change,’ or ‘I can’t be bothered with ha’pence,’
or ‘you must call again.’ There’s one great
house in Cavendish-square always takes a
month’s credit, and pays one month within another
(pays the first month as the second is
falling due), and not always that very regular.
They can’t know how poor men has to fight for
a bit of bread. Some people are very particular
about their turfs, and look very sharp for the
small clover leaves. We never have turfs left
on hand: in summer we water them to keep
them fresh; in wet weather they don’t require
it; they’ll keep without. I think I make on
turf 9<i>s.</i> a week all the year round; the summer’s
half as good again as the winter. Supposing
I make 3<i>s.</i> a week on groundsel, and
chickweed, and snails, and other things, that’s
12<i>s.</i>&mdash;but look you here, sir. I pay 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week for my rent&mdash;it’s a furnished room&mdash;and
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for my barrow; that’s 5<i>s.</i> off the
12<i>s.</i>; and I’ve a wife and one little boy. My
wife may get a day at least every week at
charring; she has 1<i>s.</i> for it and her board. She
helps me when she’s not out, and if she is out,
I sometimes have to hire a lad, so it’s no great
advantage the shilling a day. I’ve paid 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week for my barrow&mdash;it’s a very good and big
one&mdash;for four years. Before that I paid 2<i>s.</i> a
week. O yes, sir, I know very well, that at
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week I’ve paid nearly 14<i>l.</i> for a barrow
worth only 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>; but I can’t help it; I really
can’t. I’ve tried my hardest to get money to
have one of my own, and to get a few sticks
(furniture) of my own too. It’s no use trying
any more. If I have ever got a few shillings
a-head, there’s a pair of shoes wanted, or there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
something else, or my wife has a fit of sickness,
or my little boy has, or something’s sure to
happen that way, and it all goes. Last winter
was a very hard time for people in my way,
from hoar frost and fogs. I ran near 3<i>l.</i> into
debt; greater part of it for house-rent and my
barrow; the rest was small sums borrowed of
shopkeepers that I served. I paid all up in the
summer, but I’m now 14<i>s.</i> in debt for my barrow;
it always keeps me back; the man that
owns it calls every Sunday morning, but he
don’t press me, if I haven’t money. I would
get out of the life if I could, but will anybody
take a groom out of the streets? and I’m not
master of anything but grooming. I can read
and write. I was brought up a Roman Catholic,
and was christened one. I never go to mass
now. One gets out of the way of such things,
having to fight for a living as I have. It seems
like mocking going to chapel, when you’re
grumbling in your soul.”</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of Plantain-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>Plantain is sold extensively, and is given to
canaries, but water-cress is given to those birds
more than any other green thing. It is the ripe
seed, in a spike, of the “great” and the “ribbed”
plantain. The green leaves of the last-mentioned
plant used to be in demand as a styptick.
Shenstone speaks of “plantain ribbed, that heals
the reaper’s wound.” I believe that it was
never sold in the streets of London. The most
of the plantain is gathered in the brick-fields,
wherever they are found, as the greater plantain,
which gives three-fourths of the supply,
loves an arid situation. It is sold in hands to
the shops, about 60 “heads” going to a
“hand,” at a price, according to size, &amp;c.,
from 1<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> On a private round, five or
six are given for a halfpenny. It is, however,
generally gathered and sold with chickweed,
and along with chickweed I have shown the
quantity used.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The money-value of the several kinds and
quantities of “green-stuff” annually purchased
in the streets of London is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>6,696,450 </td><td class="left">bunches of </td><td class="left">water-cresses, at &frac12;<i>d.</i> per bunch</td><td>£13,950</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="total">28,557</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of the above amount, it may be said that
upwards of 14,000<i>l.</i> are spent yearly on what
may be called the bird-food of London.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_EATABLES_AND_DRINKABLES"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF EATABLES AND DRINKABLES.</h2>
</div>


<p>These dealers were more numerous, even when
the metropolitan population was but half its
present extent. I heard several causes assigned
for this,&mdash;such as the higher rate of earnings
of the labouring people at that time, as well
as the smaller number of shopkeepers who
deal in such cheap luxuries as penny pies,
and the fewer places of cheap amusement,
such as the “penny gaffs.” These places, I
was told, “run away with the young people’s
pennies,” which were, at one period, expended
in the streets.</p>

<p>The class engaged in the manufacture, or in
the sale, of these articles, are a more intelligent
people than the generality of street-sellers.
They have nearly all been mechanics who, from
inability to procure employment at their several
crafts&mdash;from dislike to an irksome and, perhaps,
sedentary confinement&mdash;or from an overpowering
desire “to be their own masters,” have
sought a livelihood in the streets. The purchase
and sale of fish, fruit, or vegetables require no
great training or deftness; but to make the
dainties, in which street-people are critical, and
to sell them at the lowest possible price, certainly
requires some previous discipline to produce
the skill to combine and the taste to please.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that I found it common
enough among these street-sellers to describe
themselves and their fraternity not by their
names or callings, but by the article in which
they deal. This is sometimes ludicrous enough:
“Is the man you’re asking about a pickled
whelk, sir?” was said to me. In answer to
another inquiry, I was told, “Oh, yes, I know
him&mdash;he’s a sweet-stuff.” Such ellipses, or
abbreviations, are common in all mechanical or
commercial callings.</p>

<p>Men and women, and most especially boys,
purchase their meals day after day in the streets.
The coffee-stall supplies a warm breakfast;
shell-fish of many kinds tempt to a luncheon;
hot-eels or pea-soup, flanked by a potato “all
hot,” serve for a dinner; and cakes and tarts,
or nuts and oranges, with many varieties of
pastry, confectionary, and fruit, woo to indulgence
in a dessert; while for supper there is a
sandwich, a meat pudding, or a “trotter.”</p>

<p>The street provisions consist of cooked or
prepared victuals, which may be divided into
solids, pastry, confectionary, and drinkables.</p>

<p>The “solids” however, of these three divisions,
are such as only regular street-buyers
consider to be sufficing for a substantial meal,
for it will be seen that the comestibles accounted
“good for dinner,” are all of a <i>dainty</i>, rather
than a solid character. Men whose lives, as I
have before stated, are alternations of starvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and surfeit, love some easily-swallowed and
comfortable food, better than the most approved
substantiality of a dinner-table. I was told by
a man, who was once foodless for thirty-eight
hours, that in looking into the window of a cook-shop&mdash;he
longed far more for a basin of soup
than for a cut from the boiled round, or the
roasted ribs, of beef. He felt a gnawing rather
than a ravenous desire, and some tasty semi-liquid
was the incessant object of his desires.</p>

<p>The solids then, according to street estimation,
consist of hot-eels, pickled whelks, oysters,
sheep’s-trotters, pea-soup, fried fish, ham-sandwiches,
hot green peas, kidney puddings, boiled
meat puddings, beef, mutton, kidney, and eel
pies, and baked potatos. In each of these provisions
the street poor find a mid-day or mid-night
meal.</p>

<p>The pastry and confectionary which tempt
the street eaters are tarts of rhubarb, currant,
gooseberry, cherry, apple, damson, cranberry,
and (so called) mince pies; plum dough and
plum-cake; lard, currant, almond and many
other varieties of cakes, as well as of tarts;
gingerbread-nuts and heart-cakes; Chelsea
buns; muffins and crumpets; “sweet stuff”
includes the several kinds of rocks, sticks, lozenges,
candies, and hard-bakes; the medicinal
confectionary of cough-drops and horehound;
and, lastly, the more novel and aristocratic
luxury of street-ices; and strawberry cream, at
1<i>d.</i> a glass, (in Greenwich Park).</p>

<p>The drinkables are tea, coffee, and cocoa;
ginger-beer, lemonade, Persian sherbet, and
some highly-coloured beverages which have no
specific name, but are introduced to the public
as “cooling” drinks; hot elder cordial or
wine; peppermint water; curds and whey;
water (as at Hampstead); rice milk; and milk
in the parks.</p>

<p>At different periods there have been attempts to
introduce more substantial viands into the street
provision trade, but all within these twenty
years have been exceptional and unsuccessful.
One man a few years back established a portable
cook-shop in Leather-lane, cutting out
portions of the joints to be carried away or eaten
on the spot, at the buyer’s option. But the
speculation was a failure. Black puddings
used to be sold, until a few years back, smoking
from cans, not unlike potato cans, in such
places as the New Cut; but the trade in these
rather suspicious articles gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert Smith, who is an acute observer
in all such matters, says, in a lively article on
the Street Boys of London:</p>

<p>“The kerb is his club, offering all the advantages
of one of those institutions without any
subscription or ballot. Had he a few pence,
he might dine equally well as at Blackwall,
and with the same variety of delicacies without
going twenty yards from the pillars of St.
Clement’s churchyard. He might begin with
a water <i>souchée</i> of eels, varying his first course
with pickled whelks, cold fried flounders, or
periwinkles. Whitebait, to be sure, he would
find a difficulty in procuring, but as the more
cunning gourmands do not believe these delicacies
to be fish at all, but merely little bits
of light pie-crust fried in grease;&mdash;and as
moreover, the brown bread and butter is after
all the grand attraction,&mdash;the boy might soon
find a substitute. Then would come the
potatos, apparently giving out so much steam
that the can which contains them seems in
momentary danger of blowing up; large, hot,
mealy fellows, that prove how unfounded were
the alarms of the bad-crop-ites; and he might
next have a course of boiled feet of some animal
or other, which he would be certain to find in
front of the gin-shop. Cyder-cups perhaps he
would not get; but there would be ‘ginger-beer
from the fountain, at 1<i>d.</i> per glass;’ and
instead of mulled claret, he could indulge in
hot elder cordial; whilst for dessert he could
calculate upon all the delicacies of the season,
from the salads at the corner of Wych-street
to the baked apples at Temple Bar. None of
these things would cost more than a penny a
piece; some of them would be under that sum;
and since as at Verey’s, and some other foreign
restaurateurs, there is no objection to your
dividing the “portions,” the boy might, if he
felt inclined to give a dinner to a friend, get off
under 6<i>d.</i> There would be the digestive
advantage too of moving leisurely about from
one course to another; and, above all, there
would be no fee to waiters.” After alluding
to the former glories of some of the street-stands,
more especially of the kidney pudding
establishments which displayed rude transparencies,
one representing the courier of St.
Petersburg riding six horses at once for a
kidney pudding, Mr. Smith continues,&mdash;“But
of all these eating-stands the chief favourite
with the boy is the potato-can. They collect
around it as they would do on ’Change, and
there talk over local matters, or discuss the
affairs of the adjacent cab-stand, in which they
are at times joined by the waterman whom they
respect, more so perhaps than the policeman;
certainly more than they do the street-keeper,
for him they especially delight to annoy, and
they watch any of their fellows eating a potato,
with a curiosity and an attention most remarkable,
as if no two persons fed in the same
manner, and they expected something strange
or diverting to happen at every mouthful.”</p>

<p>A gentleman, who has taken an artist’s interest
in all connected with the streets, and has
been familiar with their daily and nightly aspect
from the commencement of the present century,
considers that the great change is not so much
in what has ceased to be sold, but in the introduction
of fresh articles into street-traffic&mdash;such
as pine-apples and Brazil-nuts, rhubarb and
cucumbers, ham-sandwiches, ginger-beer, &amp;c.
The coffee-stall, he represents, has but superseded
the saloop-stall (of which I have previously
spoken); while the class of street-customers
who supported the saloop-dealer now support
the purveyor of coffee. The <i>appearance</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
two stalls, however, seen before daybreak, with
their respective customers, on a bleak winter’s
morning, was very different. Round the saloop-stall
was a group&mdash;hardly discernible at a little
distance in the dimly-lighted streets&mdash;the prominent
figures being of two callings now extinct&mdash;the
climbing-boy and the old hackney-coachman.</p>

<p>The little sweep <i>would</i> have his saloop smoking
hot&mdash;and there was the common appliance of a
charcoal grate&mdash;regaling himself with the savoury
steam until the mess was cool enough for
him to swallow; whilst he sought to relieve his
naked feet from the numbing effects of the cold
by standing now on the right foot and now on
the left, and swinging the other to and fro, until
a change of posture was necessitated; his white
teeth the while gleamed from his sooty visage as
he gleefully licked his lips at the warm and oily
breakfast.</p>

<p>The old hackney-coachman was wrapped up
in a many-caped great coat, drab&mdash;when it left
the tailor’s hands some years before&mdash;but then
worn and discoloured, and, perhaps, patched or
tattered; its weight alone, however, communicated
a sort of warmth to the wearer; his legs
were closely and artistically “wisped” with hay-bands;
and as he kept smiting his chest with his
arms, “to keep the cold out,” while his saloop
was cooling, he would, in no very gentle terms,
express his desire to add to its comforting influence
the stimulant of a “flash of lightning,”
a “go of rum,” or a “glass of max,”&mdash;for so a
dram of neat spirit was then called.</p>

<p>The old watchman of that day, too, almost as
heavily coated as the hackneyman, would sometimes
partake of the street “Saloop-loop-loop!
<i>Sa</i>-loop!” The woman of the town, in “looped
and windowed raggedness,” the outcast of the
very lowest class, was at the saloop, as she is
now and then at the coffee-stall, waiting until
daylight drove her to her filthy lodging-house.
But the climbing-boy has, happily, left no successor;
the hackneyman has been succeeded by
the jauntier cabman; and the taciturn old
watchman by the lounging and trim policeman.</p>

<p>Another class of street-sellers, no longer to
be seen, were the “barrow-women.” They sold
fruit of all kinds, little else, in very clean white
barrows, and their fruit was excellent, and purchased
by the wealthier classes. They were, for
the most part, Irish women, and some were remarkable
for beauty. Their dress was usually
a good chintz gown, the skirt being tidily tucked
or pinned up behind, “in a way,” said one informant,
“now sometimes seen on the stage when
correctness of costume is cared for.” These
women were prosperous in their calling, nor was
there any imputation on their chastity, as the
mothers were almost always wives.</p>

<p>Concerning the bygone street-cries, I had
also the following account from the personal
observation of an able <span class="lock">correspondent:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“First among the old ‘musical cries,’ may
be cited the ‘Tiddy Doll!’&mdash;immortalised by
Hogarth&mdash;then comes the last person, who,
with a fine bass voice, coaxed his customers to
buy <i>sweets</i> with, ‘Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Browns, browns, browns! have you got any
mouldy browns?’ There was a man, too, who
sold tripe, &amp;c., in this way, and to some purpose;
he was as fine a man as ever stepped, and his
deep rich voice would ring through a whole
street, ‘Dog’s-meat! cat’s-meat! nice tripe!
neat’s feet! Come buy my trotters!’ The last
part would not have disgraced Lablache. He
discovered a new way of pickling tripe&mdash;got on&mdash;made
contracts for supplying the Navy during
the war, and acquired a large property. One of
our most successful artists is his grandson.
Then there was that delight of our childhood&mdash;the
eight o’clock ‘Hot spiced gingerbread! hot
spiced gingerbread! buy my spiced gingerbread!
sm-o-o-king hot!’” Another informant remembered
a very popular character (among the boys),
whose daily cry was: “Hot spiced gingerbread
nuts, nuts, nuts! If <i>one</i>’ll warm you, <i>wha-at</i>’ll
a pound do?&mdash;<i>Wha-a-a-at</i>’ll a pound do?”
Gingerbread was formerly in much greater demand
than it is now.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Pea-Soup and
Hot Eels.</span></h3>

<p>Two of the condiments greatly relished by the
chilled labourers and others who regale themselves
on street luxuries, are “pea-soup” and
“hot eels.” Of these tradesmen there may be
500 now in the streets on a Saturday. As the
two trades are frequently carried on by the
same party, I shall treat of them together. The
greatest number of these stands is in Old-street,
St. Luke’s, about twenty. In warm weather
these street-cooks deal only in “hot eels” and
whelks; as the whelk trade is sometimes an accompaniment
of the others, for then the soup will
not sell. These dealers are stationary, having
stalls or stands in the street, and the savoury
odour from them attracts more hungry-looking
gazers and longers than does a cook-shop window.
They seldom move about, but generally frequent
the same place. A celebrated dealer of this class
has a stand in Clare-street, Clare-market, opposite
a cat’s-meat shop; he has been heard to
boast, that he wouldn’t soil his hands at the business
if he didn’t get his 30<i>s.</i> a day, and his 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
on a Saturday. Half this amount is considered to
be about the truth. This person has mostly all
the trade for hot eels in the Clare-market district.
There is another “hot eel purveyor” at
the end of Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road,
that does a very good trade. It is thought
that he makes about 5<i>s.</i> a day at the business,
and about 10<i>s.</i> on Saturday. There was, before
the removals, a man who came out about five
every afternoon, standing in the New-cut, nearly
opposite the Victoria Theatre, his “girl” always
attending to the stall. He had two or three
lamps with “hot eels” painted upon them, and
a handsome stall. He was considered to make
about 7<i>s.</i> a day by the sale of eels alone, but he
dealt in fried fish and pickled whelks as well, and
often had a pile of fried fish a foot high. Near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Bricklayers’ Arms, at the junction of the Old and
New Kent-roads, a hot-eel man dispenses what
a juvenile customer assured me was “as spicy
as any in London, as if there was gin in it.”
But the dealer in Clare-market does the largest
trade of all in the hot-eel line. He is “the
head man.” On one Saturday he was known
to sell 100lbs. of eels, and on most Saturdays
he will get rid of his four “draughts” of eels
(a draught being 20lbs.) He and his son are
dressed in Jenny Lind hats, bound with blue
velvet, and both dispense the provisions, while
the daughter attends to wash the cups. “On a
Sunday, anybody,” said my informant, “would
think him the first nobleman or squire in the
land, to see him dressed in his white hat, with
black crape round it, and his drab paletot and
mother-o’-pearl buttons, and black kid gloves,
with the fingers too long for him.”</p>

<p>I may add, that even the very poorest, who
have only a halfpenny to spend, as well as
those with better means, resort to the stylish
stalls in preference to the others. The eels
are all purchased at Billingsgate early in the
morning. The parties themselves, or their sons
or daughters, go to Billingsgate, and the watermen
row them to the Dutch eel vessels moored
off the market. The fare paid to the watermen
is 1<i>d.</i> for every 10lbs. purchased and brought
back in the boat, the passenger being gratis.
These dealers generally trade on their own
capital; but when some have been having “a
flare up,” and have “broke down for stock,”
to use the words of my informant, they borrow
1<i>l.</i>, and pay it back in a week or a fortnight at
the outside, and give 2<i>s.</i> for the loan of it. The
money is usually borrowed of the barrow, truck,
and basket-lenders. The amount of capital required
for carrying on the business of course
depends on the trade done; but even in a small
way, the utensils cost 1<i>l.</i> They consist of one
fish-kettle and one soup-kettle, holding upon an
average three gallons each; besides these, five
basins and five cups and ten spoons are required,
also a washhand basin to wash the cups,
basins, and spoons in, and a board and tressel
on which the whole stand. In a large way, it requires
from 3<i>l.</i> to 4<i>l.</i> to fit up a handsome stall.
For this the party would have “two fine kettles,”
holding about four gallons each, and two patent
cast-iron fireplaces (the 1<i>l.</i> outfit only admits of
the bottoms of two tin saucepans being used as
fireplaces, in which charcoal is always burning
to keep the eels and soup hot; the whelks are
always eaten cold). The crockery and spoons
would be in no way superior. A small dealer
requires, over and above this sum, 10<i>s.</i> to go to
market with and purchase stock, and the large
dealer about 30<i>s.</i> The class of persons belonging
to the business have either been bred to it,
or taken to it through being out of work. Some
have been disabled during their work, and have
resorted to it to save themselves from the workhouse.
The price of the hot eels is a halfpenny
for five or seven pieces of fish, and three-parts
of a cupfull of liquor. The charge for a half-pint
of pea-soup is a halfpenny, and the whelks
are sold, according to the size, from a halfpenny
each to three or four for the same sum. These
are put out in saucers.</p>

<p>The eels are Dutch, and are cleaned and
washed, and cut in small pieces of from a half
to an inch each. [The daughter of one of my
informants was busily engaged, as I derived this
information, in the cutting of the fish. She
worked at a blood-stained board, with a pile of
pieces on one side and a heap of entrails on the
other.] The portions so cut are then boiled, and
the liquor is thickened with flour and flavoured
with chopped parsley and mixed spices. It is
kept hot in the streets, and served out, as I have
stated, in halfpenny cupfulls, with a small quantity
of vinegar and pepper. The best purveyors
add a little butter. The street-boys are extravagant
in their use of vinegar.</p>

<p>To dress a draught of eels takes three hours&mdash;to
clean, cut them up, and cook them sufficiently;
and the cost is now 5<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> (much lower in the
summer) for the draught (the 2<i>d.</i> being the expense
of “shoring”), 8<i>d.</i> for 4 lb. of flour to
thicken the liquor, 2<i>d.</i> for the parsley to flavour
it, and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the vinegar, spices, and pepper
(about three quarts of vinegar and two ounces
of pepper). This quantity, when dressed and
seasoned, will fetch in halfpennyworths from
15<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> The profit upon this would be
from 7<i>s.</i> to 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but the cost of the charcoal
has to be deducted, as well as the salt used while
cooking. These two items amount to about 5<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The pea-soup consists of split peas, celery,
and beef bones. Five pints, at 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> a quart, are
used to every three gallons; the bones cost 2<i>d.</i>,
carrots 1<i>d.</i>, and celery &frac12;<i>d.</i>&mdash;these cost 1<i>s.</i> 0&frac14;<i>d.</i>;
and the pepper, salt, and mint, to season it,
about 2<i>d.</i> This, when served in halfpenny basinfulls,
will fetch from 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, leaving
1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> profit. But from this the expenses of
cooking must be taken; so that the clear gain
upon three gallons comes to about 11<i>d.</i> In a
large trade, three kettles, or twelve gallons, of
pea-soup will be disposed of in the day, and
about four draughts, or 80 lbs., of hot eels on
every day but Saturday,&mdash;when the quantity of
eels disposed of would be about five draughts, or
100 lbs. weight, and about 15 gallons of pea-soup.
Hence the profits of a good business in
the hot-eel and pea-soup line united will be from
7<i>l.</i> to 7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per week, or more. But there is
only one man in London does this amount of
business, or rather makes this amount of money.
A small business will do about 15 lbs. of eels in
the week, including Saturday, and about 12 gallons
of soup. Sometimes credit is given for a
halfpennyworth, or a pennyworth, at the outside;
but very little is lost from bad debts.
Boys who are partaking of the articles will occasionally
say to the proprietor of the stall, “Well,
master, they <i>are</i> nice; trust us another ha’p’orth,
and I’ll pay you when I comes again;”
but they are seldom credited, for the stall-keepers
know well they would never see them again.
Very often the stock cooked is not disposed of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and then it is brought home and eaten by the
family. The pea-soup will seldom keep a night,
but what is left the family generally use for
supper.</p>

<p>The dealers go out about half-past ten in the
morning, and remain out till about ten at night.
Monday is the next best day to Saturday. The
generality of the customers are boys from 12 to
16 years of age. Newsboys are very partial
to hot eels&mdash;women prefer the pea-soup. Some
of the boys will have as many as six halfpenny
cupfulls consecutively on a Saturday night; and
some women will have three halfpenny basinsfull
of soup. Many persons in the cold weather
prefer the hot soup to beer. On wet, raw, chilly
days, the soup goes off better than usual, and
in fine weather there is a greater demand for the
hot eels. One dealer assured me that he once
<i>did</i> serve two gentlemen’s servants with twenty-eight
halfpenny cupfulls of hot eels one after
another. One servant had sixteen, and the other
twelve cupfulls, which they ate all at one standing;
and one of these customers was so partial
to hot eels, that he used to come twice a day
every day for six months after that, and have
eight cupfulls each day, four at noon and four
in the evening. These two persons were the best
customers my informant ever had. Servants,
however, are not generally partial to the commodity.
Hot eels are not usually taken for
dinner, nor is pea-soup, but throughout the
whole day, and just at the fancy of the passers-by.
There are no shops for the sale of these
articles. The dealers keep no accounts of what
their receipts and expenditure are.</p>

<p>The best time of the year for the hot eels is
from the middle of June to the end of August.
On some days during that time a person in a
small way of business will clear upon an average
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, on other days 1<i>s.</i>; on some days,
during the month of August, as much as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a day. Some cry out “Nice hot eels&mdash;nice hot
eels!” or “Warm your hands and fill your
bellies for a halfpenny.” One man used to give
his surplus eels, when he considered his sale
completed on a night, to the poor creatures
refused admission into a workhouse, lending
them his charcoal fire for warmth, which was
always returned to him. The poor creatures
begged cinders, and carried the fire under a
railway arch. The general rule, however, is for
the dealer to be silent, and merely expose the
articles for sale. “I likes better,” said one man
to me, “to touch up people’s noses than their
heyes or their hears.” There are now in the
trade almost more than can get a living at it,
and their earnings are less than they were
formerly. One party attributed this to the
opening of a couple of penny-pie shops in his
neighbourhood. Before then he could get 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a day clear, take one day with another; but
since the establishment of the business in the
penny-pie line he cannot take above 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
day clear. On the day the first of these pie-shops
opened, it made as much as 10 lbs., or half
a draught of eels, difference to him. There was
a band of music and an illumination at the pie-shop,
and it was impossible to stand against
<i>that</i>. The fashionable dress of the trade is the
“Jenny Lind” or “wide-awake” hat, with a
broad black ribbon tied round it, and a white
apron and sleeves. The dealers usually go to
Hampton-court or Greenwich on a fine Sunday.
They are partial to the pit of Astley’s. One of
them told his waterman at Billingsgate the other
morning that “he and his good lady had been
werry amused with the osses at Hashley’s last
night.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Hot-Eel and
Pea-soup Man.</span></h3>

<p>“I was a coalheaver,” said one of the class
to me, as I sat in his attic up a close court,
watching his wife “thicken the liquor;” “I
was a-going along the plank, from one barge
to another, when the swell of some steamers
throwed the plank off the ‘horse,’ and chucked
me down, and broke my knee agin the side of
the barge. Before that I was yarning upon an
average my 20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a week. I was seven
months and four days in King’s College Hospital
after this. I found they was a-doing me
no good there, so I come out and went over to
Bartholemy’s Hospital. I was in there nineteen
months altogether, and after that I was a
month in Middlesex Hospital, and all on ’em
turned me out oncurable. You see, the bone’s
decayed&mdash;four bits of bone have been taken
from it. The doctor turned me out three
times ’cause I wouldn’t have it off. He asked
my wife if she would give consent, but neither
she nor my daughter would listen to it, so I
was turned out on ’em all. How my family
lived all this time it’s hard to tell. My eldest
boy did a little&mdash;got 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week as an
errand-boy, and my daughter was in service,
and did a little for me; but that was all we had
to live upon. There was six children on my
hands, and however they <i>did</i> manage I can’t
say. After I came out of the hospital I applied
to the parish, and was allowed 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week
and four loaves. But I was anxious to do
something, so a master butcher, as I knowed,
said he would get me ‘a pitch’ (the right to
fix a stall), if I thought I could sit at a stall
and sell a few things. I told him I thought
I could, and would be very thankful for it.
Well, I had heard how the man up in the
market was making a fortune at the hot-eel and
pea-soup line. [A paviour as left his barrow
and two shovels with me told me to-day, said
the man, by way of parenthesis&mdash;‘that he
knowed for a fact he was clearing 6<i>l.</i> a week
regular.’] So I thought I’d have a touch at
the same thing. But you see, I never could
rise money enough to get sufficient stock to
make a do of it, and never shall, I expect&mdash;it
don’t seem like it, however. I ought to have
5<i>s.</i> to go to market with to-morrow, and I ain’t
got above 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and what’s that for stock-money,
I’d like to know? Well, as I was
saying, the master butcher lent me 10<i>s.</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
start in the line. He was the best friend I
ever had. But I’ve never been able to do
anything at it&mdash;not to say to get a living.”
“He can’t carry anything now, sir,” said his
wife, as the old man strove to get the bellows
to warm up the large kettle of pea-soup that
was on the fire. “Aye, I can’t go without my
crutch. My daughter goes to Billingsgate for
me. I’ve got nobody else; and she cuts up
the eels. If it warn’t for her I must give it
up altogether, and go into the workhouse outright.
I couldn’t fetch ’em. I ought to have
been out to-night by rights till ten, if I’d had
anything to have sold. My wife can’t do
much; she’s troubled with the rheumatics in
her head and limbs.” “Yes,” said the old
body, with a sigh, “I’m never well, and never
shall be again, I know.” “Would you accept
on a drop of soup, sir?” asked the man;
“you’re very welcome, I can assure you.
You’ll find it very good, sir.” I told him I
had just dined, and the poor old fellow proceeded
with his tale. “Last week I earned
clear about 8<i>s.</i>, and that’s to keep six on us.
I didn’t pay no rent last week nor yet this, and
I don’t know when I shall again, if things goes
on in this way. The week before there was a
fast-day, and I didn’t earn above 6<i>s.</i> that week,
if I did that. My boy can’t go to school.
He’s got no shoes nor nothing to go in. The
girls go to the ragged-school, but we can’t send
them of a Sunday nowhere.” “Other people
can go,” said one of the young girls nestling
round the fire, and with a piece of sacking over
her shoulders for a shawl&mdash;“them as has got
things to go in; but mother don’t like to let us
go as we are.” “She slips her mother’s shoes
on when she goes out. It would take 1<i>l.</i> to
start me well. With that I could go to market,
and buy my draught of eels a shilling cheaper,
and I could afford to cut my pieces a little
bigger; and people where they gets used well
comes again&mdash;don’t you see? I could have
sold more eels if I’d had ’em to-day, and soup
too. Why, there’s four hours of about the best
time to-night that I’m losing now ’cause I’ve
nothing to sell. The man in the market can
give more than we can. He gives what is
called the lumping ha’p’orth&mdash;that is, seven or
eight pieces; ah, that I daresay he does;
indeed, some of the boys has told me he gives
as many as eight pieces. And then the more
eels you biles up, you see, the richer the liquor
is, and in our little tin-pot way it’s like biling
up a great jint of meat in a hocean of water.
In course we can’t compete agin the man in
the market, and so we’re being ruined entirely.
The boys very often comes and asks me if I’ve
got a farden’s-worth of heads. The woman at
Broadway, they tells me, sells ’em at four a
farden and a drop of liquor, but we chucks ’em
away, there’s nothing to eat on them; the boys
though will eat anything.”</p>

<p>In the hot-eel trade are now 140 vendors,
each selling 6 lb. of eels daily at their stands;
60 sell 40 lb. daily; and 100 are itinerant,
selling 5 lb. nightly at the public-houses. The
first mentioned take 2<i>s.</i> daily; the second 16<i>s.</i>;
and the third 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> This gives a street expenditure
in the trade in hot eels of 21,910<i>l.</i> for
the year.</p>

<p>To start in this business a capital is required
after this rate:&mdash;stall 6<i>s.</i>; basket 1<i>s.</i>; eel-kettle
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; jar 6<i>d.</i>; ladle 4<i>d.</i>; 12 cups 1<i>s.</i>;
12 spoons 1<i>s.</i>; stew-pan 2<i>s.</i>; chafing-dish 6<i>d.</i>;

vinegar 10<i>d.</i>; 1 lb. salt &frac12;<i>d.</i>; 1 lb. candles for
stall 6<i>d.</i>; parsley 3<i>d.</i>; stock-money 10<i>s.</i> In
all 1<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> In the course of a year the property
which may be described as fixed, as in
the stall, &amp;c., and the expenditure daily occurring
as for stock, butter, coal, according to
the foregoing statement, amounts to 15,750<i>l.</i>
The eels purchased for this trade at Billingsgate
are 1,166,880 lb., costing, at 3<i>d.</i> per lb.,
14,586<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In the pea-soup trade there are now one half
of the whole number of the hot-eel vendors;
of whom 100 will sell, each 4 gallons daily;
and of the remaining 50 vendors, each will sell
upon an average 10 gallons daily. The first
mentioned take 3<i>s.</i> daily; and the last 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
This gives a street expenditure of 4,050<i>l.</i> during
the winter season of five months.</p>

<p>To commence business in the street sale of
pea-soup a capital is required after this rate:
soup-kettle 4<i>s.</i>; peas 2<i>s.</i>; soup-ladle 6<i>d.</i>;
pepper-box 1<i>d.</i>; mint-box 3<i>d.</i>; chafing-dish
6<i>d.</i>; 12 basons 1<i>s.</i>; 12 spoons 1<i>s.</i>; bones,
celery, mint, carrots, and onions, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In
all 10<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> The hot-eel trade being in conjunction
with the pea-soup, the same stall,
candles, towels, sleeves, and aprons, does for
both, and the quantity of extra coal and charcoal;
pepper and salt given in the summary
of hot-eels serves in cooking, &amp;c., both eels and
pea-soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Pickled
Whelks.</span></h3>

<p>The trade in whelks is one of which the costermongers
have the undisputed monopoly. The
wholesale business is all transacted in Billingsgate,
where this shell-fish is bought by the
measure (a double peck or gallon), half-measure,
or wash. A wash is four measures, and is the
most advantageous mode of purchase; “It’s so
much cheaper by taking that quantity,” I was
told, “it’s as good as having a half-measure
in.” An average price for the year may be 4<i>s.</i>
the wash; “But I’ve given 21<i>s.</i> for three wash,”
said one costermonger, and he waxed indignant
as he spoke, “one Saturday, when there was a
great stock in too, just because there was a fair
coming on on Monday, and the whelkmen, who
are the biggest rogues in Billingsgate, always
have the price up then, and hinder a poor man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
doing good&mdash;they’ve a great knack of that.” A
wash weighs about 60 lbs. On rare occasions it
has been as low as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and even 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>About one-half of the whelks are sold alive
(wholesale), and the other half “cooked”
(boiled), some of the salesmen having “convenience
for cooking” near the market; but they
are all brought to London alive, “or what
should be alive.” When bought alive, which
ensures a better quality, I was told&mdash;for
“whelks’ll boil after they’re dead and gone,
you see, sir, as if they was alive and hungry”&mdash;the
costermonger boils them in the largest saucepan
at his command for about ten minutes, and
then leaves them until they cool. “They never
kicks as they boils, like lobsters or crabs,” said
one whelk dealer, “they takes it quiet. A missionary
cove said to me, ‘Why don’t you kill
them first? it’s murder.’ <i>They</i> doesn’t suffer;
<i>I’ve</i> suffered more with a toothach than the
whole of a measure of whelks has in a boiling,
that I’m clear upon.” The boiling is generally
the work of the women. The next process is to
place them in a tub, throw boiling water over
them, and stir them up for ten or fifteen minutes
with a broom-handle. If the quantity be a wash,
two broom-handles, usually wielded by the man
and his wife, are employed. This is both to
clean them and “to make them come out easier
to be wormed.” The “worming” is equivalent
to the removing of the beard of an oyster or
mussel. The whelks are wormed one by one.
The operator cuts into the fish, rapidly draws
out the “worm,” and pushes the severed parts
together, which closes. The small whelks are
not wormed, “because it’s not reckoned necessary,
and they’re sold to poor lads and such
like, that’s not particular; but nearly all the
women, and a good many of the boys, are very
particular. They think the worm’s poison.”
The whelks are next shaken in a tub, in cold
water, and are then ready for sale. The same
process, after the mere boiling, is observed,
when the whelks are bought “cooked.”</p>

<p>Some whelk-sellers, who wish to display a
superior article, engage children for a few halfpence
to rub the shell of every whelk, so that it
looks clean and even bright.</p>

<p>I find a difficulty, common in the course of
this inquiry, of ascertaining precisely the number
of whelk-sellers, because the sale is often
carried on simultaneously with that of other
things, (stewed eels, for instance,) and because
it is common for costermongers to sell whelks
on a Saturday night only, both at stalls and
“round to the public-houses,” but only when
they are cheap at Billingsgate. On a Saturday
night there may be 300 whelk-sellers in the
streets, nearly half at stalls, and half, or more,
“working the public-houses.” But of this
number it must be understood that perhaps the
wife is at the stall while the husband is on a
round, and some whelks are sent out by a man
having an extra stock. This, therefore, reduces
the number of independent dealers, but not the
actual number of sellers. On all other nights
there may be half the number engaged in this
traffic, in the streets regularly all the year; and
more than half on a Monday, as regards the
public-house business, in which little is done
between Monday and Saturday nights. But a
man will, in some instances, work the public-houses
every night (the wife tending the stall),
and the more assiduously if the weather be bad
or foggy, when a public-house custom is the best.
A fair week’s earnings in whelks, “when a man’s
known,” is 1<i>l.</i>; a bad week is from 5<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>
I am assured that bad weeks are “as plenty as
good, at least, the year round;” and thus the
average to the street whelk-sellers, in whelks
alone, is about 13<i>s.</i> when the trade is carried on
daily and regularly, and 5<i>s.</i> a week by those who
occasionally resort to it; and as the occasional
hands are the more numerous, the average may
be struck at 7<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The whelks are sold at the stalls at two, three,
four, six, and eight a penny, according to size.
Four is an average pennyworth for good whelks;
the six a penny are small, and the eight a penny
very small. The principal place for their sale is
in Old-street, City-road. The other principal
places are the street-markets, which I have
before particularised. The whelks are sold in
saucers, generally small and white, and of
common ware, and are contained in jars, ready
to be “shelled” into any saucer that may have
been emptied. Sometimes a small pyramid of
shells, surmounted by a candle protected by a
shade, attracts the regard of the passer-by.
The man doing the best business in London
was to be found, before the removals of which I
have spoken, in Lambeth-walk, but he has now
no fixed locality. His profits, I am informed,
were regularly 3<i>l.</i> a week; but out of this he
had to pay for the assistance of two or sometimes
three persons, in washing his whelks,
boiling them, &amp;c.; besides that, his wife was as
busy as himself. To the quality and cleanliness
of his whelks he was very attentive, and would
sell no mediocre article if better could be
bought. “He deserved all he earned, sir,”
said another street-dealer to me; “why, in
Old-street now they’ll have the old original
saucers, miserable things, such as they had
fifty years back; but the man we’re talking
of, about two years ago, brought in very pretty
plates, quite enterprising things, and they
answered well. His example’s spreading, but
it’s slowly.” The whelks are eaten with vinegar
and pepper.</p>

<p>For sale in the public-houses, the whelks are
most frequently carried in jars, and transferred
in a saucer to the consumer. “There’s often a
good sale,” said a man familiar with the business,
“when a public room’s filled. People
drinking there always want to eat. They buy
whelks, not to fill themselves, but for a relish. A
man that’s used to the trade will often get off
inferior sorts to the lushingtons; he’ll have
them to rights. Whelks is all the same, good,
bad, or middling, when a man’s drinking, if
they’re well seasoned with pepper and vinegar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Oh yes; any whelk-man will take in a drunken
fellow, and he will do it all the same, if he’s
made up his mind to, get drunk hisself that very
night.”</p>

<p>The trade is carried on by the regular costers,
but of the present number of whelk-sellers, about
twenty have been mechanics or servants. The
whelk-trade is an evening trade, commencing
generally about six, summer and winter, or an
hour earlier in winter.</p>

<p>The capital required to start in the whelk-business
is: stall, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; saucers, vinegar-bottle,
jar, pepper-castor, and small watering-pan (used
only in dusty weather), 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a pair of stilts
(supports for the stall), 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; stock-money, 5<i>s.</i>;
pepper and vinegar, 6<i>d.</i>, or 12<i>s.</i> in all. If the
trade be commenced in a round basket, for
public-house sale, 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> only is required,
but it is a hazardous experiment for a person
unpractised in street business.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Customers, etc., of Pickled
Whelk-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>An intelligent man gave me the following account.
He had been connected with street-trading
from his youth up, and is now about
thirty:</p>

<p>“The chief customers for whelks, sir, are
working people and poor people, and they prefer
them to oysters; I do myself, and I think
they’re not so much eaten because they’re not
fashionable like oysters. But I’ve sold them to
first-rate public-houses, and to doctors’ shops&mdash;more
than other shops, I don’t know why&mdash;and
to private houses. Masters have sent out their
servant-maids to me for three or four penn’orths
for supper. I’ve offered the maids a whelk, but
they won’t eat them in the street; I dare say
they’re afraid their young men may be about,
and might think they wasn’t ladies if they eat
whelks in the street. Boys are the best customers
for ‘small,’ but if you don’t look sharp,
you’ll be done out of three-ha’porth of vinegar
to a ha’porth of whelks. I can’t make out why
they like it so. They’re particular enough in
their way. If the whelks are thin, as they will
be sometimes, the lads will say, ‘What a lot of
snails you’ve gathered to-night!’ If they’re
plump and fine, then they’ll say, ‘Fat ’uns to-night&mdash;stunners!’
Some people eat whelks for
an appetite; they give me one, and more in
summer than winter. The women of the town
are good customers, at least they are in the Cut
and Shoreditch, for I know both. If they have
five-penn’orth, when they’re treated perhaps,
there’s always sixpence. They come on the
sly sometimes, by themselves, and make what’s
a meal, I’m satisfied, on whelks, and they’ll
want credit sometimes. I’ve given trust to a
woman of that sort as far as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I’ve lost
very little by them; I don’t know how much
altogether. I keep no account, but carry any
credit in my head. Those women’s good pay,
take it altogether, for they know how hard it is
to get a crust, and have a feeling for a poor
man, if they haven’t for a rich one&mdash;that’s my
opinion, sir. Costermongers in a good time
are capital customers; they’ll buy five or six
penn’orths at a time. The dust’s a great injury
to the trade in summer time; it dries the
whelks up, and they look old. I wish whelks
were cheaper at Billingsgate, and I could do
more business; and I could do more if I could
sell a few minutes after twelve on a Saturday
night, when people must leave the public-house.
I have sold three wash of a Saturday night, and
cleared 15<i>s.</i> on them. I one week made 3<i>l.</i>, but
I had a few stewed eels to help,&mdash;that is, I
cleared 2<i>l.</i>, and had a pound’s worth over on
the Saturday night, and sent them to be sold&mdash;and
they were sold&mdash;at Battersea on the Sunday;
I never went there myself. I’ve had
twenty people round my stall at one time on a
Saturday. Perhaps my earnings on that (and
other odd things) may come to 1<i>l.</i> a week, or
hardly so much, the year round. I can’t say
exactly. The shells are no use. Boys have
asked me for them ‘to make sea-shells of,’
they say&mdash;to hold them to their ears when
they’re big, and there’s a sound like the
sea rolling. Gentlemen have sometimes told
me to keep a dozen dozen or twenty dozen,
for borders to a garden. I make no charge
for them&mdash;just what a gentleman may please
to give.”</p>

<p>The information given shows an outlay of
5,250<i>l.</i> yearly for street whelks, and as the return
I have cited shows the money spent in whelks at
Billingsgate to be 2,500<i>l.</i>, the number of whelks
being 4,950,000, the account is correct, as the
coster’s usual “half-profits” make up the sum
expended.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sellers, and of the
Preparation of Fried Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Among the cooked food which has for many
years formed a portion of the street trade is
fried fish. The sellers are about 350, as a
maximum and 250 as a minimum, 300 being an
average number. The reason of the variation
in number is, that on a Saturday night, and
occasionally on other nights, especially on Mondays,
stall-keepers sell fried fish, and not as an
ordinary article of their trade. Some men, too,
resort to the trade for a time, when they cannot
be employed in any way more profitable or
suitable to them. The dealers in this article
are, for the most part, old men and boys, though
there may be 30 or 40 women who sell it, but
only 3 or 4 girls, and they are the daughters of
the men in the business as the women are the
wives. Among the fried-fish sellers there are
not half a dozen Irish people, although fish is
so especial a part of the diet of the poor Irish.
The men in the calling have been, as regards
the great majority, mechanics or servants;
none, I was told, had been fishmongers, or their
assistants.</p>

<p>The fish fried by street dealers is known as
“plaice dabs” and “sole dabs,” which are
merely plaice and soles, “dab” being a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>mon
word for any flat fish. The fish which
supplies upwards of one half the quantity fried
for the streets is plaice; the other fishes used
are soles, haddocks, whitings, flounders, and
herrings, but very sparingly indeed as regards
herrings. Soles are used in as large a quantity
as the other kinds mentioned altogether. On
my inquiry as to the precise quantity of each
description fried, the answer from the traders
was uniform: “I can’t say, sir. I buy whatever’s
cheapest.” The fish is bought at Billingsgate,
but some of the street dealers obtain
another and even a cheaper commodity than at
that great mart. This supply is known in the
trade as “friers,” and consists of the overplus
of a fishmonger’s stock, of what he has not sold
overnight, and does not care to offer for sale on
the following morning, and therefore vends it to
the costermongers, whose customers are chiefly
among the poor. The friers are sometimes half,
and sometimes more than half, of the wholesale
price in Billingsgate. Many of the friers are
good, but some, I was told, “in any thing like
muggy or close weather were very queer fish,
very queer indeed,” and they are consequently
fried with a most liberal allowance of oil, “which
will conceal anything.”</p>

<p>The fish to be fried is first washed and gutted;
the fins, head, and tail are then cut off,
and the trunk is dipped in flour and water, so
that in frying, oil being always used, the skin
will not be scorched by the, perhaps, too violent
action of the fire, but merely browned. Pale
rape oil is generally used. The sellers, however,
are often twitted with using lamp oil, even
when it is dearer than that devoted to the purpose.
The fish is cooked in ordinary frying-pans.
One tradesman in Cripplegate, formerly
a costermonger, has on his premises a commodious
oven which he had built for the frying, or
rather baking, of fish. He supplies the small
shopkeepers who deal in the article (although
some prepare it themselves), and sells his fish
retail also, but the street-sellers buy little of
him, as they are nearly all “their own cooks.”
Some of the “illegitimates,” however, lay in
their stock by purchase of the tradesman in
question. The fish is cut into portions before
it is fried, and the frying occupies about ten
minutes. The quantity prepared together is
from six to twenty portions, according to the
size of the pans; four dozen portions, or
“pieces,” as the street people call them, require
a quart of oil.</p>

<p>The fried fish-sellers live in some out of the
way alley, and not unfrequently in garrets; for
among even the poorest class there are great
objections to their being fellow-lodgers, on
account of the odour from the frying. Even
when the fish is fresh (as it most frequently is),
and the oil pure, the odour is rank. In one
place I visited, which was, moreover, admirable
for cleanliness, it was very rank. The cooks,
however, whether husbands or wives&mdash;for the
women often attend to the pan&mdash;when they
hear of this disagreeable rankness, answer that
it may be so, many people say so; but for their
parts they cannot smell it at all. The garments
of the fried-fish sellers are more strongly
impregnated with the smell of fish than were
those of any “wet” or other fish-sellers whom
I met with. Their residences are in some of
the labyrinths of courts and alleys that run
from Gray’s-inn-lane to Leather-lane, and
similar places between Fetter and Chancery-lanes.
They are to be found, too, in the courts
running from Cow-cross, Smithfield; and from
Turnmill-street and Ray-street, Clerkenwell;
also, in the alleys about Bishopsgate-street and
the Kingsland-road, and some in the half-ruinous
buildings near the Southwark and
Borough-roads. None, or very few, of those
who are their own cooks, reside at a greater
distance than three miles from Billingsgate. A
gin-drinking neighbourhood, one coster said,
suits best, “for people hasn’t their smell so
correct there.”</p>

<p>The sale is both on rounds and at stalls, the
itinerants being twice as numerous as the stationary.
The round is usually from public-house
to public-house, in populous neighbourhoods.
The itinerants generally confine themselves to
the trade in fried fish, but the stall-keepers
always sell other articles, generally fish of some
kind, along with it. The sale in the public-houses
is the greatest.</p>

<p>At the neighbouring races and fairs there is
a great sale of fried fish. At last Epsom races,
I was told, there were at least fifty purveyors
of that dainty from London, half of them perhaps
being costermongers, who speculated in it
merely for the occasion, preparing it themselves.
Three men joined in one speculation, expending
8<i>l.</i> in fish, and did well, selling at the usual
profit of cent. per cent., but with the drawback
of considerable expenses. Their customers at
the races and fairs are the boys who hold horses
or brush clothes, or who sell oranges or nuts,
or push at roundabouts, and the costers who are
there on business. At Epsom races there was
plenty of bread, I was informed, to be picked
up on the ground; it had been flung from the
carriages after luncheon, and this, with a piece
of fish, supplied a meal or “a relish” to hundreds.</p>

<p>In the public-houses, a slice of bread, 16 or
32 being cut from a quartern loaf&mdash;as they are
whole or half slices&mdash;is sold or offered with the
fish for a penny. The cry of the seller is, “fish
and bread, a penny.” Sometimes for an extra-sized
piece, with bread, 2<i>d.</i> is obtained, but
very seldom, and sometimes two pieces are
given for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> At the stalls bread is rarely
sold with the edible in question.</p>

<p>For the itinerant trade, a neatly painted
wooden tray, slung by a leathern strap from the
neck, is used: the tray is papered over generally
with clean newspapers, and on the paper
is spread the shapeless brown lumps of fish.
Parsley is often strewn over them, and a salt-box
is placed at the discretion of the customer.
The trays contain from two to five dozen pieces.
<span class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
I understand that no one has a trade greatly in
advance of his fellows. The whole body complain
of their earnings being far less than was
the case four or five years back.</p>

<p>The itinerant fried fish-sellers, when pursuing
their avocation, wear generally a jacket of cloth
or fustian buttoned round them, but the rest of
their attire is hidden by the white sleeves and
apron some wear, or by the black calico sleeves
and dark woollen aprons worn by others.</p>

<p>The capital required to start properly in the
business is:&mdash;frying-pan 2<i>s.</i> (second-hand 9<i>d.</i>);
tray 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (second-hand 8<i>d.</i>); salt-box 6<i>d.</i>
(second-hand 1<i>d.</i>); and stock-money 5<i>s.</i>&mdash;in
all 10<i>s.</i> A man has gone into the trade, however,
with 1<i>s.</i>, which he expended in fish and
oil, borrowed a frying-pan, borrowed an old tea-board,
and so started on his venture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Fried Fish-seller,
and of the Class of Customers.</span></h3>

<p>The man who gave me the following information
was well-looking, and might be about 45 or
50. He was poorly dressed, but his old brown
surtout fitted him close and well, was jauntily
buttoned up to his black satin stock, worn, but
of good quality; and, altogether, he had what is
understood among a class as “a <i>betterly</i> appearance
about him.” His statement, as well as those
of the other vendors of provisions, is curious in
its details of public-house <span class="lock">vagaries:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been in the trade,” he said, “seventeen
years. Before that, I was a gentleman’s servant,
and I married a servant-maid, and we had
a family, and, on that account, couldn’t, either
of us, get a situation, though we’d good characters.
I was out of employ for seven or eight
months, and things was beginning to go to the
pawn for a living; but at last, when I gave up
any hope of getting into a gentleman’s service, I
raised 10<i>s.</i>, and determined to try something
else. I was persuaded, by a friend who kept a
beer-shop, to sell oysters at his door. I took his
advice, and went to Billingsgate for the first
time in my life, and bought a peck of oysters for
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I was dressed respectable then&mdash;nothing
like the mess and dirt I’m in now” [I may
observe, that there was no dirt about him];
“and so the salesman laid it on, but I gave him
all he asked. I know a deal better now. I’d
never been used to open oysters, and I couldn’t
do it. I cut my fingers with the knife slipping
all over them, and had to hire a man to open for
me, or the blood from my cut fingers would have
run upon the oysters. For all that, I cleared
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on that peck, and I soon got up to the
trade, and did well; till, in two or three months,
the season got over, and I was advised, by the
same friend, to try fried fish. That suited me.
I’ve lived in good families, where there was
first-rate men-cooks, and I know what good
cooking means. I bought a dozen plaice; I
forget what I gave for them, but they were
dearer then than now. For all that, I took between
11<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> the first night&mdash;it was Saturday&mdash;that
I started; and I stuck to it, and took
from 7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> every night, with more, of course,
on Saturday, and it was half of it profit then. I
cleared a good mechanic’s earnings at that time&mdash;30<i>s.</i>
a week and more. Soon after, I was told
that, if agreeable, my wife could have a stall
with fried fish, opposite a wine-vaults just
opened, and she made nearly half as much as I
did on my rounds. I served the public-houses,
and soon got known. With some landlords I
had the privilege of the parlour, and tap-room,
and bar, when other tradesmen have been kept
out. The landlords will say to me still: ‘<i>You</i>
can go in, Fishy.’ Somehow, I got the name of
‘Fishy’ then, and I’ve kept it ever since. There
was hospitality in those days. I’ve gone into a
room in a public-house, used by mechanics, and
one of them has said: ‘I’ll stand fish round,
gentlemen;’ and I’ve supplied fifteen penn’orths.
Perhaps he was a stranger, such a sort of customer,
that wanted to be agreeable. Now, it’s
more likely I hear: ‘Jack, lend us a penny to
buy a bit of fried;’ and then Jack says: ‘You
be d&mdash;d! here, lass, let’s have another pint.’
The insults and difficulties I’ve had in the public-house
trade is dreadful. I once sold 16<i>d.</i>
worth to three rough-looking fellows I’d never
seen before, and they seemed hearty, and asked
me to drink with them, so I took a pull; but
they wouldn’t pay me when I asked, and I
waited a goodish bit before I did ask. I thought,
at first, it was their fun, but I waited from four
to seven, and I found it was no fun. I felt
upset, and ran out and told the policeman, but
he said it was only a debt, and he couldn’t interfere.
So I ran to the station, but the head man
there said the same, and told me I should hand
over the fish with one hand, and hold out the
other hand for my money. So I went back to
the public-house, and asked for my money&mdash;and
there was some mechanics that knew me there
then&mdash;but I got nothing but ‘&mdash;&mdash; you’s!’ and
one of ’em used most dreadful language. At
last, one of the mechanics said: ‘Muzzle him,
Fishy, if he won’t pay.’ He was far bigger than
me, him that was one in debt; but my spirit was
up, and I let go at him and gave him a bloody
nose, and the next hit I knocked him backwards,
I’m sure I don’t know how, on to a table; but
I fell on him, and he clutched me by the coat-collar&mdash;I
was respectable dressed then&mdash;and half
smothered me. He tore the back of my coat,
too, and I went home like Jim Crow. The pot-man
and the others parted us, and they made
the man give me 1<i>s.</i>, and the waiter paid me the
other 4<i>d.</i>, and said he’d take his chance to get
it&mdash;but he never got it. Another time I went
into a bar, and there was a ball in the house, and
one of the ball gents came down and gave my
basket a kick without ever a word, and started
the fish; and in a scuffle&mdash;he was a little fellow,
but my master&mdash;I had this finger put out of
joint&mdash;you can see that, sir, still&mdash;and was in
the hospital a week from an injury to my leg;
the tiblin bone was hurt, the doctors said” [the
tibia.] “I’ve had my tray kicked over for a
lark in a public-house, and a scramble for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fish, and all gone, and no help and no money for
me. The landlords always prevent such things,
when they can, and interfere for a poor man;
but then it’s done sudden, and over in an instant.
That sort of thing wasn’t the worst. I once had
some powdery stuff flung sudden over me at a
parlour door. My fish fell off, for I jumped,
because I felt blinded, and what became of them
I don’t know; but I aimed at once for home&mdash;it
was very late&mdash;and had to feel my way almost
like a blind man. I can’t tell what I suffered.
I found it was something black, for I kept rubbing
my face with my apron, and could just tell
it came away black. I let myself in with my
latch, and my wife was in bed, and I told her to
get up and look at my face and get some water,
and she thought I was joking, as she was half
asleep; but when she got up and got a light, and
a glass, she screamed, and said I looked such a
shiny image; and so I did, as well as I could
see, for it was black lead&mdash;such as they use for
grates&mdash;that was flung on me. I washed it off,
but it wasn’t easy, and my face was sore days
after. I had a respectable coat on then, too,
which was greatly spoiled, and no remedy at all.
I don’t know who did it to me. I heard some
one say: ‘You’re served out beautiful.’ Its
men that calls themselves gentlemen that does
such things. I know the style of them then&mdash;it
was eight or ten years ago; they’d heard of
Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and his goings on. That way it’s
better now, but worse, far, in the way of getting
a living. I dare say, if I had dressed in rough
corderoys, I shouldn’t have been larked at so
much, because they might have thought I was
a regular coster, and a fighter; but I don’t like
that sort of thing&mdash;I like to be decent and respectable,
if I can.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in the ‘fried’ trade ever since,
except about three months that I tried the sandwiches.
I didn’t do so well in them, but it was
a far easier trade; no carrying heavy weights all
the way from Billingsgate: but I went back to
the fried. Why now, sir, a good week with me&mdash;and
I’ve only myself in the trade now” [he
was a widower]&mdash;“is to earn 12<i>s.</i>, a poor week
is 9<i>s.</i>; and there’s as many of one as of the
other. I’m known to sell the best of fish, and
to cook it in the best style. I think half of us,
take it round and round for a year, may earn as
much as I do, and the other half about half as
much. I think so. I might have saved money,
but for a family. I’ve only one at home with
me now, and he really <i>is</i> a good lad. My customers
are public-house people that want a
relish or a sort of supper with their beer, not so
much to drinkers. I sell to tradesmen, too; 4<i>d.</i>
worth for tea or supper. Some of them send to
my place, for I’m known. The Great Exhibition
can’t be any difference to me. I’ve a regular
round. I used to sell a good deal to women
of the town, but I don’t now. They haven’t the
money, I believe. Where I took 10<i>s.</i> of them,
eight or ten years ago, I now take only 6<i>d.</i> They
may go for other sorts of relishes now; I can’t
say. The worst of my trade is, that people must
have as big penn’orths when fish is dear as when
its cheap. I never sold a piece of fish to an
Italian boy in my life, though they’re Catholics.
Indeed, I never saw an Italian boy spend a halfpenny
in the streets on anything.”</p>

<p>A working-man told me that he often bought
fried fish, and accounted it a good to men like
himself. He was fond of fried fish to his supper;
he couldn’t buy half so cheap as the street-sellers,
perhaps not a quarter; and, if he could,
it would cost him 1<i>d.</i> for dripping to fry the fish
in, and he got it ready, and well fried, and generally
good, for 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Subsequent inquiries satisfied me that my informant
was correct as to his calculations of his
fellows’ earnings, judging from his own. The
price of plaice at Billingsgate is from &frac12;<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i>
each, according to size (the fried fish purveyors
never calculate by the weight), &frac34;<i>d.</i> being a fair
average. A plaice costing 1<i>d.</i> will now be fried
into four pieces, each 1<i>d.</i>; but the addition of
bread, cost of oil, &amp;c., reduces the “fried”
peoples’ profits to rather less than cent. per
cent. Soles and the other fish are, moreover,
30 per cent. dearer than plaice. As 150 sellers
make as much weekly as my informant, and the
other 150 half that amount, we have an average
yearly earning of 27<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> in one case, and of
13<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> in the other. Taking only 20<i>l.</i> a year
as a medium earning, and adding 90 per cent.
for profit, the outlay on the fried fish supplied
by London street-sellers is 11,400<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Preparation and Quantity of
Sheep’s Trotters, and of the Street-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of sheep’s trotters, as a regular street-trade,
is confined to London, Liverpool, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
and a few more of our greater
towns. The “trotter,” as it is commonly called,
is the boiled foot of the sheep. None of my
readers can have formed any commensurate
notion of the extent of the sale in London, and
to some readers the very existence of such a
comestible may be unknown. The great supply
now required is readily attained. The wholesale
trade is now in the hands of one fellmongering
firm, though until within these twenty
months or so there were two, and the feet are
cut off the sheep-skins by the salesmen in the
skin-market, in Bermondsey, and conveyed to
the fellmonger’s premises in carts and in
trucks.</p>

<p>Sheep’s trotters, one of my informants could
remember, were sold in the streets fifty years
ago, but in such small quantities that it could
hardly be called a trade. Instead of being prepared
wholesale as at present, and then sold out
to the retailers, the trotters were then prepared
by the individual retailers, or by small traders
in tripe and cow-heel. Twenty-five years
ago nearly all the sheep’s trotters were “lined
and prepared,” when the skin came into
the hands of the fellmonger, for the glue and
size makers. Twenty years ago only about one-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>twentieth
of the trotters now prepared for eating
were devoted to the same purpose; and it was
not until about fifteen years back that the trade
began to reach its present magnitude; and for
the last twelve years it has been about stationary,
but there were never more sold than last
year.</p>

<p>From fifteen to twenty years ago glue and size,
owing principally to improved modes of manufacture,
became cheaper, so that it paid the fellmonger
better to dispose of the trotters as an
article “cooked” for the poor, than to the glue-boiler.</p>

<p>The process of cookery is carried on rapidly
at the fellmonger’s in question. The feet are
first scalded for about half an hour. After that
from ten to fifteen boys are employed in scooping
out the hoofs, which are sold for manure or
to manufacturers of Prussian blue, which is extensively
used by painters. Women are then
employed, forty being an average number, “to
scrape the hair off,”&mdash;for hair it is called&mdash;quickly,
but softly, so that the skin should not
be injured, and after that the trotters are boiled
for about four hours, and they are then ready
for market.</p>

<p>The proprietor of this establishment, after he
had obligingly given me the information I
required, invited me to walk round his premises
unaccompanied, and observe how the business
was conducted. The premises are extensive, and
are situated, as are nearly all branches of the
great trade connected with hides and skins, in
Bermondsey. The trotter business is kept distinct
from the general fellmongering. Within
a long shed are five coppers, each containing, on
an average, 250 “sets,” a set being the complement
of the sheep’s feet, four. Two of these
coppers, on my visit, were devoted to the scalding,
and three to the boiling of the trotters.
They looked like what one might imagine to be
witches’ big caldrons; seething, hissing, boiling,
and throwing forth a steam not peculiarly
grateful to the nostrils of the uninitiated. Thus
there are, weekly, “cooking” in one form or
other, the feet of 20,000 sheep for the consumption
of the poorer classes, or as a relish for those
whose stomachs crave after edibles of this description.
At one extremity of this shed are
the boys, who work in a place open at the side,
but the flues and fires make all parts sufficiently
warm. The women have a place to themselves
on the opposite side of the yard. The room
where they work has forms running along its
sides, and each woman has a sort of bench in
front of her seat, on which she scrapes the
trotters. One of the best of these workwomen
can scrape 150 sets, or 600 feet in a day, but
the average of the work is 500 sets a week,
including women and girls. I saw no girls but
what seemed above seventeen or eighteen, and
none of the women were old. They were exceedingly
merry, laughing and chatting, and appearing
to consider that a listener was not of primary
consequence, as they talked pretty much altogether.
I saw none but what were decently
dressed, some were good-looking, and none
seemed sickly.</p>

<p>In this establishment are prepared, weekly,
20,000 sets, or 80,000 feet; a yearly average of
4,160,000 trotters, or the feet of 1,040,000 sheep.
Of this quantity the street-folk buy seven-eighths;
3,640,000 trotters yearly, or 70,000
weekly. The number of sheep trotter-sellers
may be taken at 300, which gives an average of
nearly sixty sets a week per individual.</p>

<p>The wholesale price, at the “trotter yard,” is
five a penny, which gives an outlay by the
street-sellers of 3,033<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> yearly.</p>

<p>But this is not the whole of the trade.
Lamb’s trotters are also prepared, but only to
one-twentieth of the quantity of sheep’s trotters,
and that for only three months of the year.
These are all sold to the street-sellers. The
lamb’s foot is usually left appended to the
leg and shoulder of lamb. It is weighed with
the joint, but the butcher’s man or boy will say
to the purchaser: “Do you want the foot?”
As the answer is usually in the negative, it is at
once cut off and forms a “perquisite.” There
are some half dozen men, journeymen butchers
not fully employed, who collect these feet, prepare
and sell them to the street-people, but as
the lamb’s feet are very seldom as fresh as those
of the sheep carried direct from the skin market
to&mdash;so to speak&mdash;the great trotter kitchen, the
demand for “lamb’s” falls off yearly. Last
year the sale may be taken at about 14,000 sets,
selling, wholesale, at about 46<i>l.</i>, the same price
as the sheep.</p>

<p>The sellers of trotters, who are stationary at
publichouse and theatre doors, and at street
corners, and itinerant, but itinerant chiefly from
one public house to another are a wretchedly
poor class. Three fourths of them are elderly
women and children, the great majority being
Irish people, and there are more boys than girls
in the trade. The capital required to start in
the business is very small. A hand basket of
the larger size costs 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, but smaller or
second-hand only 1<i>s.</i>, and the white cotton cloth
on which the trotters are displayed costs 4<i>d.</i> or
6<i>d.</i>; stock-money need not exceed 1<i>s.</i>, so that
3<i>s.</i> is all that is required. This is one reason,
I heard from several trotter-sellers, why the
business is over-peopled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statements of Sheep’s Trotter Women.</span></h3>

<p>From one woman, who, I am assured, may
be taken as a fair type of the better class of
trotter-sellers&mdash;some of the women being sottish
and addicted to penn’orths of gin beyond
their means&mdash;I had the following statement.
I found her in the top room of a lofty house in
Clerkenwell. She was washing when I called,
and her son, a crippled boy of 16, with his
crutch by his side, was cleaning knives, which
he had done for many months for a family in
the neighbourhood, who paid for his labour
in what the mother pronounced better than
money&mdash;broken victuals, because they were of
such good, wholesome quality. The room, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
is of a good size, had its red-brown plaster walls,
stained in parts with damp, but a great portion
was covered with the cheap engravings “given
away with No. 6” (or any other number) of some
periodical “of thrilling interest;” while the narrow
mantel-shelf was almost covered with pot
figures of dumpy men, red-breeched and blue-coated,
and similar ornaments. I have often
noted such attempts to subdue, as it were, the
grimness of poverty, by the poor who had “seen
better days.” The mother was tall and spare,
and the boy had that look of premature sedateness,
his face being of a sickly hue, common to
those of quiet dispositions, who have been afflicted
from their <span class="lock">childhood:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’m the widow of a sawyer, sir,” said Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash;, with a very slight brogue, for she was an
Irishwoman, “and I’ve been a widow 18 long
years. I’m 54, I believe, but that 18 years seems
longer than all the rest of my life together. My
husband earned hardly ever less than 30<i>s.</i> a week,
sometimes 3<i>l.</i>, and I didn’t know what pinching
was. But I was left destitute with four young
children, and had to bring them up as well as
I could, by what I could make by washing and
charing, and a hard fight it was. One of my
children went for a soldier, one’s dead, another’s
married, and that’s the youngest there. Ah!
poor fellow, what he’s gone through! He’s had
18 abscesses, one after another, and he has been
four times in Bartholomew’s. There’s only God
above to help him when I’m gone. My health
broke six years ago, and I couldn’t do hard work
in washing, and I took to trotter selling, because
one of my neighbours was in that way, and told
me how to go about it. My son sells trotters
too; he always sits at the corner of this street.
I go from one public-house to another, and
sometimes stand at the door, or sit inside, because
I’m known and have leave. But I can’t
either sit, or stand, or walk long at a time, I’m
so rheumatic. No, sir, I can’t say I was ever
badly insulted in a public-house; but I only go
to those I know. Others may be different. We
depend mostly on trotters, but I have a shilling
and my meat, for charing, a day in every week.
I’ve tried ’winks and whelks too, ’cause I thought
they might be more in my pocket than trotters,
but they don’t suit a poor woman that’s begun
a street-trade when she’s not very young. And
the trotters can be carried on with so little
money. It’s not so long ago that I’ve sold three-penn’orth
of trotters&mdash;that is, him and me has&mdash;pretty
early in the evening; I’d bought them
at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;’s, in Bermondsey, in the afternoon,
for we can buy three penn’orth, and I walked
there again&mdash;perhaps it’s four miles there and
back&mdash;and bought another 3<i>d.</i> worth. The first
three-pence was all I could rise. It’s a long
weary way for me to walk, but some walk from
Poplar and Limehouse. If I lay out 2<i>s.</i> on the
Saturday&mdash;there’s 15 sets for 1<i>s.</i>, that’s 60
trotters&mdash;they’ll carry us on to Monday night,
and sometimes, if they’ll keep, to Tuesday night.
Sometimes I could sell half-a-crown’s worth in
less time. I have to go to Bermondsey three or
four times a week. The trade was far better six
years ago, though trotters were dearer then, only
13 sets 1<i>s.</i>, then 14, now 15. For some very
few, that’s very fine and very big, I get a penny
a piece; for some I get 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> for two; the most’s
&frac12;<i>d.</i> each; some’s four for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; and some I
have to throw into the dust-hole. The two of
us earns 5<i>s.</i> a week on trotters, not more, I’m
sure. I sell to people in the public-houses;
some of them may be rather the worse for drink,
but not so many; regular drunkards buys nothing
but drink. I’ve sold them too to steady,
respectable gentlemen, that’s been passing in
the street, who put them in their pockets for
supper. My rent’s 1<i>s.</i> a week.”</p>

<p>I then had some conversation with the poor
lad. He’d had many a bitter night, he told
me, from half-past five to twelve, for he knew
there was no breakfast for his mother and him
if he couldn’t sell some trotters. He had a cry
sometimes. He didn’t know any good it did
him, but he couldn’t help it. The boys gathered
round him sometimes, and teased him,
and snatched at his crutch; and the policeman
said that he must make him “move on,” as he
encouraged the boys about him. He didn’t like
the boys any more than they were fond of the
policemen. He had often sad thoughts as he
sat with his trotters before him, when he didn’t
cry; he wondered if ever he would be better off;
but what could he do? He could read, but not
write; he liked to read very well when he had
anything to read. His mother and he never
missed mass.</p>

<p>Another old woman, very poorly, but rather
tidily dressed, gave me the following account,
which shows a little of public-house <span class="lock">custom:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve seen better days, sir, I have indeed; I
don’t like to talk about that, but now I’m only
a poor sheep’s trotter seller, and I’ve been one a
good many years. I don’t know how long, and
I don’t like to think about it. It’s a shocking
bad trade, and such insults as we have to put
up with. I serve some public-houses, and I
stand sometimes at a playhouse-door. I make
3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and in a very good week
4<i>s.</i>, but, then, I sometimes make only 2<i>s.</i> I’m
infirm now, God help me! and I can do nothing
else. Another old woman and me has a room
between us, at 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a week. Mother’s the
best name I’m called in a public-house, and it
ain’t a respectable name. ‘Here, mother, give
us one of your b&mdash; trotters,’ is often said to me.
One customer sometimes says: ‘The stuff’ll
choke me, but that’s as good as the Union.’ <i>He</i>
ain’t a bad man, though. He sometimes treats
me. He’ll bait my trotters, but that’s his larking
way, and then he’ll say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘A pennorth o’ gin,</div>
       <div class="verse">’ll make your old body spin.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It’s his own poetry, he says. I don’t know
what he is, but he’s often drunk, poor fellow.
Women’s far worse to please than men. I’ve
known a woman buy a trotter, put her teeth
into it, and then say it wasn’t good, and return
it. It wasn’t paid for when she did so, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>cause
I grumbled, I was abused by her, as if
I’d been a Turk. The landlord interfered, and
he said, said he, ‘I’ll not have this poor woman
insulted; she’s here for the convenience of
them as requires trotters, and she’s a well-conducted
woman, and I’ll not have her insulted,’
he says, says he, lofty and like a gentleman,
sir. ‘Why, who’s insulting the old b&mdash;h?’
says the woman, says she. ‘Why, you are,’
says the landlord, says he, ‘and you ought to
pay her for her trotter, or how is she to live?’
‘What the b&mdash; h&mdash;ll do I care how she lives,’
says the woman, ‘its nothing to me, and I
won’t pay her.’ ‘Then I will,’ says the landlord,
says he, ‘here’s 6<i>d.</i>,’ and he wouldn’t take
the change. After that I soon sold all my
trotters, and some gave me double price, when
the landlord showed himself such a gentleman,
and I went out and bought nine trotters more,
another woman’s stock, that she was dreading
she couldn’t sell, and I got through them in no
time. It was the best trotter night I ever had.
She wasn’t a woman of the town as used me so.
I have had worse sauce from modest women, as
they called themselves, than from the women
of the town, for plenty of <i>them</i> knows what
poverty is, and is civiler, poor things&mdash;yes,
I’m sure of that, though it’s a shocking life&mdash;O,
shocking! I never go to the playhouse-door
but on a fine night. Young men treats their
sweethearts to a trotter, for a relish, with a drop
of beer between the acts. Wet nights is the
best for public-houses. ‘They’re not salt
enough,’ has been said to me, oft enough, ‘they
don’t make a man thirsty.’ It’ll come to the
workhouse with me before long, and, perhaps,
all the better. It’s warm in the public-house,
and that draws me to sell my trotters there
sometimes. I live on fish and bread a good
deal.”</p>

<p>The returns I collected show that there is
expended yearly in London streets on trotters,
calculating their sale, retail, at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, 6,500<i>l.</i>,
but though the regular price is &frac12;<i>d.</i>, some trotters
are sold at four for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, very few higher than
&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and some are kept until they are unsaleable,
so that the amount may be estimated at 6,000<i>l.</i>,
a receipt of 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, per individual seller,
rather more than one-half of which sum is
profit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Trade in Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>baked potato trade</i>, in the way it is at present
carried on, has not been known more than
fifteen years in the streets. Before that, potatoes
were sometimes roasted as chestnuts are
now, but only on a small scale. The trade is
more profitable than that in fruit, but continues
for but six months of the year.</p>

<p>The potatoes, for street-consumption, are
bought of the greengrocers, at the rate of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the cwt. They are usually a large-sized
“fruit,” running about two or three to the
pound. The kind generally bought is what are
called the “French Regent’s.” French potatoes
are greatly used now, as they are cheaper
than the English. The potatoes are picked,
and those of a large size, and with a rough
skin, selected from the others, because they are
the mealiest. A waxy potato shrivels in the
baking. There are usually from 280 to 300
potatoes in the cwt.; these are cleaned by the
huckster, and, when dried, taken in baskets,
about a quarter cwt. at a time, to the baker’s, to
be cooked. They are baked in large tins, and
require an hour and a half to do them well.
The charge for baking is 9<i>d.</i> the cwt., the baker
usually finding the tins. They are taken home
from the bakehouse in a basket, with a yard and
a half of green baize in which they are covered
up, and so protected from the cold. The huckster
then places them in his can, which consists
of a tin with a half-lid; it stands on four legs,
and has a large handle to it, while an iron fire-pot
is suspended immediately beneath the vessel
which is used for holding the potatoes. Directly
over the fire-pot is a boiler for hot water.
This is concealed within the vessel, and serves
to keep the potatoes always hot. Outside the
vessel where the potatoes are kept is, at one
end, a small compartment for butter and salt,
and at the other end another compartment for
fresh charcoal. Above the boiler, and beside
the lid, is a small pipe for carrying off the
steam. These potato-cans are sometimes
brightly polished, sometimes painted red, and
occasionally brass-mounted. Some of the
handsomest are all brass, and some are highly
ornamented with brass-mountings. Great pride
is taken in the cans. The baked-potato man
usually devotes half an hour to polishing them
up, and they are mostly kept as bright as silver.
The handsomest potato-can is now in Shoreditch.
It cost ten guineas, and is of brass
mounted with German silver. There are three
lamps attached to it, with coloured glass, and of
a style to accord with that of the machine; each
lamp cost 5<i>s.</i> The expense of an ordinary
can, tin and brass-mounted, is about 50<i>s.</i> They
are mostly made by a tinman in the Ratcliffe-highway.
The usual places for these cans to
stand are the principal thoroughfares and street-markets.
It is considered by one who has been
many years at the business, that there are,
taking those who have regular stands and those
who are travelling with their cans on their arm,
at least two hundred individuals engaged in
the trade in London. There are three at the
bottom of Farringdon-street, two in Smithfield,
and three in Tottenham-court-road (the two
places last named are said to be the best
‘pitches’ in all London), two in Leather-lane,
one on Holborn-hill, one at King’s-cross, three
at the Brill, Somers-town, three in the New-cut,
three in Covent-garden (this is considered
to be on market-days the second-best pitch),
two at the Elephant and Castle, one at Westminster-bridge,
two at the top of Edgeware-road,
one in St. Martin’s-lane, one in Newport-market,
two at the upper end of Oxford-street,
one in Clare-market, two in Regent-street, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in Newgate-market, two at the Angel, Islington,
three at Shoreditch church, four about
Rosemary-lane, two at Whitechapel, two near
Spitalfields-market, and more than double the
above number wandering about London. Some
of the cans have names&mdash;as the “Royal Union
Jack” (engraved in a brass plate), the “Royal
George,” the “Prince of Wales,” the “Original
Baked Potatoes,” and the “<i>Old</i> Original Baked
Potatoes.”</p>

<p>The business begins about the middle of
August and continues to the latter end of April,
or as soon as the potatoes get to any size,&mdash;until
they are pronounced ‘bad.’ The season,
upon an average, lasts about half the year,
and depends much upon the weather. If
it is cold and frosty, the trade is brisker
than in wet weather; indeed then little is doing.
The best hours for business are from half-past
ten in the morning till two in the afternoon,
and from five in the evening till eleven or
twelve at night. The night trade is considered
the best. In cold weather the potatoes are frequently
bought to warm the hands. Indeed,
an eminent divine classed them, in a public
speech, among the best of modern improvements,
it being a cheap luxury to the poor
wayfarer, who was benumbed in the night by
cold, and an excellent medium for diffusing
warmth into the system, by being held in the
gloved hand. Some buy them in the morning
for lunch and some for dinner. A newsvender,
who had to take a hasty meal in his shop, told
me he was “always glad to hear the baked-potato
cry, as it made a dinner of what was
only a snack without it.” The best time at
night, is about nine, when the potatoes are
purchased for supper.</p>

<p>The customers consist of all classes. Many
gentlefolks buy them in the street, and take
them home for supper in their pockets; but the
working classes are the greatest purchasers.
Many boys and girls lay out a halfpenny in a
baked potato. Irishmen are particularly fond
of them, but they are the worst customers, I am
told, as they want the largest potatoes in the
can. Women buy a great number of those sold.
Some take them home, and some eat them in
the street. Three baked potatoes are as much
as will satisfy the stoutest appetite. One potato
dealer in Smithfield is said to sell about 2&frac12; cwt.
of potatoes on a market-day; or, in other words,
from 900 to 1,000 potatoes, and to take upwards
of 2<i>l.</i> One informant told me that he himself
had often sold 1&frac12; cwt. of a day, and taken 1<i>l.</i> in
halfpence. I am informed, that upon an average,
taking the good stands with the bad ones
throughout London, there are about 1 cwt. of
potatoes sold by each baked-potato man&mdash;and
there are 200 of these throughout the metropolis&mdash;making
the total quantity of baked
potatoes consumed every day 10 tons. The
money spent upon these comes to within a few
shillings of 125<i>l.</i> (calculating 300 potatoes to
the cwt., and each of those potatoes to be sold
at a halfpenny). Hence, there are 60 tons of
baked potatoes eaten in London streets, and
750<i>l.</i> spent upon them every week during the
season. Saturdays and Mondays are the best
days for the sale of baked potatoes in those
parts of London that are not near the markets;
but in those in the vicinity of Clare, Newport,
Covent-garden, Newgate, Smithfield, and other
markets, the trade is briskest on the market-days.
The baked-potato men are many of them
broken-down tradesmen. Many are labourers
who find a difficulty of obtaining employment
in the winter time; some are costermongers;
some have been artisans; indeed, there are some
of all classes among them.</p>

<p>After the baked potato season is over, the
generality of the hucksters take to selling strawberries,
raspberries, or anything in season.
Some go to labouring work. One of my informants,
who had been a bricklayer’s labourer,
said that after the season he always looked out
for work among the bricklayers, and this kept
him employed until the baked potato season
came round again.</p>

<p>“When I first took to it,” he said, “I was
very badly off. My master had no employment
for me, and my brother was ill, and so was my
wife’s sister, and I had no way of keeping ’em,
or myself either. The labouring men are mostly
out of work in the winter time, so I spoke to a
friend of mine, and he told me how he managed
every winter, and advised me to do the same.
I took to it, and have stuck to it ever since.
The trade was much better then. I could buy
a hundred-weight of potatoes for 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>,
and there were fewer to sell them. We generally
use to a cwt. of potatoes three-quarters of
a pound of butter&mdash;tenpenny salt butter is what
we buy&mdash;a pennyworth of salt, a pennyworth of
pepper, and five pennyworth of charcoal. This,
with the baking, 9<i>d.</i>, brings the expenses to just
upon 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cwt., and for this our receipts
will be 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, thus leaving about 5<i>s.</i> per cwt.
profit.” Hence the average profits of the trade
are about 30<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;“and more to some,”
said my informant. A man in Smithfield-market,
I am credibly informed, clears at the
least 3<i>l.</i> a week. On the Friday he has a fresh
basket of hot potatoes brought to him from the
baker’s every quarter of an hour. Such is his
custom that he has not even time to take money,
and his wife stands by his side to do so.</p>

<p>Another potato-vender who shifted his can,
he said, “from a public-house where the tap
dined at twelve,” to another half-a-mile off,
where it “dined at one, and so did the parlour,”
and afterwards to any place he deemed
best, gave me the following account of his <span class="lock">customers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Such a day as this, sir [Jan. 24], when the
fog’s like a cloud come down, people looks very
shy at my taties, very; they’ve been more suspicious
ever since the taty rot. I thought I
should never have rekivered it; never, not the
rot. I sell most to mechanics&mdash;I was a grocer’s
porter myself before I was a baked taty&mdash;for
their dinners, and they’re on for good shops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
where I serves the taps and parlours, and pays
me without grumbling, like gentlemen. Gentlemen
does grumble though, for I’ve sold to
them at private houses when they’ve held the
door half open as they’ve called me&mdash;aye, and
ladies too&mdash;and they’ve said, ‘Is <i>that</i> all for
2<i>d.</i>?’ If it’d been a peck they’d have said the
same, I know. Some customers is very pleasant
with me, and says I’m a blessing. One
always says he’ll give me a ton of taties when
his ship comes home, ’cause he can always have
a hot murphy to his cold saveloy, when tin’s
short. He’s a harness-maker, and the railways
has injured him. There’s Union-street and
there’s Pearl-row, and there’s Market-street,
now,&mdash;they’re all off the Borough-road&mdash;if I
go there at ten at night or so, I can sell 3<i>s.</i>
worth, perhaps, ’cause they know me, and I
have another baked taty to help there sometimes.
They’re women that’s not reckoned the
best in the world that buys there, but they pay
me. I know why I got my name up. I had
luck to have good fruit when the rot was about,
and they got to know me. I only go twice or
thrice a week, for it’s two miles from my regular
places. I’ve trusted them sometimes.
They’ve said to me, as modest as could be,
‘Do give me credit, and ’pon my word you
shall be paid; there’s a dear!’ I am paid
mostly. Little shopkeepers is fair customers,
but I do best for the taps and the parlours.
Perhaps I make 12<i>s.</i> or 15<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;I hardly
know, for I’ve only myself and keep no ’count&mdash;for
the season; money goes one can’t tell
how, and ’specially if you drinks a drop, as I
do sometimes. Foggy weather drives me to it,
I’m so worritted; that is, now and then, you’ll
mind, sir.”</p>

<p>There are, at present, 300 vendors of hot
baked potatoes getting their living in the streets
of London, each of whom sell, upon an average,
&frac34; cwt. of potatoes daily. The average takings
of each vendor is 6<i>s.</i> a day; and the receipts of
the whole number throughout the season (which
lasts from the latter end of September till March
inclusive), a period of 6 months, is 14,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>A capital is required to start in this trade, as
follows:&mdash;can, 2<i>l.</i>; knife, 3<i>d.</i>; stock-money, 8<i>s.</i>;
charge for baking 100 potatoes, 1<i>s.</i>; charcoal,
4<i>d.</i>; butter, 2<i>d.</i>; salt, 1<i>d.</i>, and pepper, 1<i>d.</i>;
altogether, 2<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> The can and knife is the
only property described as fixed, stock-money,
&amp;c., being daily occurring, amounts to 75<i>l.</i>
during the season.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Trotting,” or “Hawking”
Butchers.</span></h3>

<p>These two appellations are, or have been,
used somewhat confusedly in the meat trade.
Thirty, or forty, or fifty years ago&mdash;for each
term was mentioned to me&mdash;the butcher in
question was a man who went “trotting” on
his small horse to the more distant suburbs to
sell meat. This was when the suburbs, in any
direction, were “not built up to” as they are
now, and the appearance of the trotting butcher
might be hailed as saving a walk of a mile, or
a mile and a half, to a butcher’s shop, for only
tradesmen of a smaller capital then opened
butcher’s shops in the remoter suburbs. For a
suburban butcher to send round “for orders”
at that period would have occupied too much
time, for a distance must be traversed; and to
have gone, or sent, on horseback, would have
entailed the keeping or hiring of a horse which
was in those days an expensive matter. One
butcher who told me that he had known the
trade, man and boy, for nearly fifty years, said:
“As to ‘trotting,’ a small man couldn’t so
well do it, for if 20<i>l.</i> was offered for a tidy
horse in the war time it would most likely be
said, ‘I’ll get more for it in the cavaldry&mdash;for
it was often called cavaldry then&mdash;there’s better
plunder there.’ (<i>Plunder</i>, I may explain, is a
common word in the horse trade to express
<i>profit</i>.) So it wasn’t so easy to get a horse.”
The trotting butchers were then men sent or
going out from the more frequented parts to
supply the suburbs, but in many cases only
when a tradesman was “hung up” with meat.
They carried from 20 to 100 lb. of meat generally
in one basket, resting on the pommel of
the saddle, and attached by a long leathern
strap to the person of the “trotter.” The
trade, however, was irregular and, considering
the expenses, little remunerative; neither was
it extensive, but what might be the extent I
could not ascertain. There then sprung up the
class of butchers&mdash;or rather the class became
greatly multiplied&mdash;who sent their boys or men
on fast trotting horses to take orders from the
dwellers in the suburbs, and even in the streets,
not suburbs, which were away from the shop
thoroughfares, and afterwards to deliver the
orders&mdash;still travelling on horseback&mdash;at the
customer’s door. This system still continues,
but to nothing like its former extent, and as it
does not pertain especially to the street-trade
I need not dwell upon it at present, nor on the
competition that sprung up as to “trotting
butcher’s ponies,”&mdash;in the “matching” of
which “against time” sporting men have
taken great interest.</p>

<p>Of “trotting” butchers, keeping their own
horses, there are now none, but there are still,
I am told, about six of the class who contrive,
by hiring, or more frequently borrowing, horses
of some friendly butcher, to live by trotting.
These men are all known, and all call upon
known customers&mdash;often those whom they have
served in their prosperity, for the trotting butcher
is a “reduced” man&mdash;and are not likely
to be succeeded by any in the same line, or&mdash;as
I heard it called&mdash;“ride” of business.
These traders not subsisting exactly upon street
traffic, or on any adventure depending upon
door by door, or street by street, commerce,
but upon a <i>connection</i> remaining from their
having been in business on their own accounts,
need no further mention.</p>

<p>The present class of street-traders in raw
meat are known to the trade as “hawking”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
butchers, and they are as thoroughly street-sellers
as are the game and poultry “hawkers.”
Their number, I am assured, is never less than
150, and sometimes 200 or even 250. They
have all been butchers, or journeymen butchers,
and are broken down in the one case, or
unable to obtain work in the other. They then
“watch the turn of the markets,” as small
meat “jobbers,” and&mdash;as on the Stock Exchange&mdash;“invest,”
when they account the
market at the lowest. The meat so purchased
is hawked in a large basket carried on the
shoulders, if of a weight too great to be sustained
in a basket on the arm. The sale is
confined almost entirely to public-houses, and
those at no great distance from the great meat
marts of Newgate, Leadenhall, and Whitechapel.
The hawkers do not go to the suburbs.
Their principal trade is in pork and veal,&mdash;for
those joints weigh lighter, and present a larger
surface in comparison with the weight, than
do beef or mutton. The same may be said of
lamb; but of that they do not buy one quarter
so much as of pork or veal.</p>

<p>The hawking butcher bought his meat last
year at from 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> the pound, according
to kind and quality. He seldom gave 6<i>d.</i>, even
years ago, when meat was dearer; for it is difficult&mdash;I
was told by one of these hawkers&mdash;to
get more than 6<i>d.</i> per lb. from chance customers,
no matter what the market price. “If I
ask 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 7<i>d.</i>,” he said, “I’m sure of one
answer&mdash;‘Nonsense!’ I never goes no higher
nor 6<i>d.</i>” Sometimes&mdash;and especially if he can
command credit for two or three days&mdash;the
hawking butcher will buy the whole carcass of
a sheep. If he reside near the market, he may
“cut it up” in his own room; but he can generally
find the necessary accommodation at some
friendly butcher’s block. If the weather be
“bad for keeping,” he will dispose of a portion
of the carcass to his brother-hawkers; if cold,
he will persevere in hawking the whole himself.
He usually, however, buys only a hind or fore-quarter
of mutton, or other meat, except beef,
which he buys by the joint, and more sparingly
than he buys any other animal food. The hawker
generally has his joints weighed before he starts,
and can remember the exact pounds and ounces
of each, but the purchasers generally weigh them
before payment; or, as one hawker expressed it,
“They goes to the scales before they come to the
tin.”</p>

<p>Many of these hawkers drink hard, and, being
often men of robust constitution, until the approach
of age, can live “hard,”&mdash;as regards
lodging, especially. One hawker I heard of
slept in a slaughter-house, on the bare but clean
floor, for nearly two years: “But that was seven
years ago, and no butcher would allow it now.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Hawking
Butcher.</span></h3>

<p>A middle-aged man, the front of his head being
nearly bald, and the few hairs there were to be
seen shining strongly and lying flat, as if rubbed
with suet or dripping, gave me the following
account. He was dressed in the usual blue garb
of the <span class="lock">butcher:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve hawked, sir&mdash;well, perhaps for fifteen
years. My father was a journeyman butcher,
and I helped him, and so grew up to it. I never
had to call regular work, and made it out with
hawking. Perhaps I’ve hawked, take it altogether,
nearly three quarters of every year. The
other times I’ve had a turn at slaughtering.
But I haven’t slaughtered for these three or
four years; I’ve had turns as a butcher’s porter,
and wish I had more, as it’s sure browns, if it’s
only 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day: but there’s often a bit of
cuttings. I sell most pork of anything in
autumn and winter, and most mutton in
summer; but the summer isn’t much more than
half as good as the winter for my trade. When I
slaughtered I had 3<i>s.</i> for an ox, 4<i>d.</i> for a sheep,
and 1<i>s.</i> for a pig. Calves is slaughtered by the
master’s people generally. Well, I dare say it
<i>is</i> cruel the way they slaughter calves; you
would think it so, no doubt. I believe they
slaughter cheaper now. If I buy cheap&mdash;and
on a very hot day and a slow market, I have
bought a fore, aye, and a hind, quarter of mutton,
about two and a half stone each (8 lbs.
to the stone), at 2<i>d.</i> a pound; but that’s
only very, very seldom&mdash;when I buy cheap
sir, I aim at 2<i>d.</i> a pound over what I give, if
not so cheap at 1<i>d.</i>, and then its low to my
customers. But I cut up the meat, you see,
myself, and I carry it. I sell eight times as
much to public-houses and eating-houses as
anywhere else; most to the publics if they’ve
ordinaries, and a deal for the publics’ families’
eating, ’cause a landlord knows I wouldn’t
deceive <i>him</i>,&mdash;and there’s a part of it taken
out in drink, of course, and landlords is good
judges. Trade was far better years back.
I’ve heard my father and his pals talk about
a hawking butcher that twenty years ago was
imprisoned falsely, and got a honest lawyer to
bring his haction, and had 150<i>l.</i> damages for
false imprisonment. It was in the Lord
Mayor’s Court of Equity, I’ve heard. It was
a wrong arrest. I don’t understand the particulars
of it, but it’s true; and the damages
was for loss of time and trade. I’m no
lawyer myself; not a bit. I have sold the like
of a loin of mutton, when it was small, in a
tap-room, to make chops for the people there.
They’ll cook chops and steaks for a pint of beer,
at a public; that is, you must order a pint&mdash;but
I’ve sold it very seldom. When mutton was
dearer it was easier to sell it that way, for I
sold cheap; and at one public the mechanics&mdash;I
hardly know just what they was, something
about building&mdash;used to gather there at one
o’clock and wait for ‘Giblets’; so they called me
there. I live a good bit on the cuttings of the
meat I hawk, or I chop a meal off if I can
manage or afford it, or my wife&mdash;(I’ve only a
wife and she earns never less than 2<i>s.</i> a week
in washing for a master butcher&mdash;I wish I was
a master butcher,&mdash;and that covers the rent)&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wife makes it into broth. Take it all the
year round, I s’pose I sell three stun a day
(24 lb.), and at 1<i>d.</i> a pound profit. Not a
farthing more go round and round. I don’t
think the others, altogether, do as much, for
I’m known to a many landlords. But some
make 3<i>s.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> a day oft enough. I’ve made
as much myself sometimes. We all aim at 1<i>d.</i>
a pound profit, but have to take less in hot
weather sometimes. Last year 4<i>d.</i> the pound has
been a haverage price to me for all sorts.”</p>

<p>“Dead salesmen,” as they are called&mdash;that is,
the market salesmen of the meat sent so largely
from Scotland and elsewhere, ready slaughtered&mdash;expressed
to me their conviction that my
informant’s calculation was correct, and might
be taken as an average; so did butchers. Thus,
then, we find that the hawking butchers, taking
their number at 150, sell 747,000 lbs. of meat,
producing 12,450<i>l.</i> annually, one-fourth being
profit; this gives an annual receipt of 83<i>l.</i> each,
and an annual earning of 20<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> The capital
required to start in this trade is about 20<i>s.</i>, which
is usually laid out as follows:&mdash;A basket for the
shoulders, which costs 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a leathern strap,
1<i>s.</i>; a basket for the arm, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a butcher’s
knife, 1<i>s.</i>; a steel, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a leather belt for the
waist to which the knife is slung, 6<i>d.</i>; a chopper,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and a saw, 2<i>s.</i>; 6<i>s.</i> stock-money,
though credit is sometimes given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Ham-Sandwiches.</span></h3>

<p>The ham-sandwich-seller carries his sandwiches
on a tray or flat basket, covered with a clean
white cloth; he also wears a white apron, and
white sleeves. His usual stand is at the doors
of the theatres.</p>

<p>The trade was unknown until eleven years
ago, when a man who had been unsuccessful in
keeping a coffee-shop in Westminster, found it
necessary to look out for some mode of living,
and he hit upon the plan of vending sandwiches,
precisely in the present style, at the
theatre doors. The attempt was successful; the
man soon took 10<i>s.</i> a night, half of which was
profit. He “attended” both the great theatres,
and was “doing well;” but at five or six weeks’
end, competitors appeared in the field, and increased
rapidly, and so his sale was affected,
people being regardless of his urging that he
“was the original ham-sandwich.” The capital
required to start in the trade was small; a few
pounds of ham, a proportion of loaves, and a
little mustard was all that was required, and
for this 10<i>s.</i> was ample. That sum, however,
could not be commanded by many who were
anxious to deal in sandwiches; and the man
who commenced the trade supplied them at 6<i>d.</i>
a dozen, the charge to the public being 1<i>d.</i>
a-piece. Some of the men, however, murmured,
because they thought that what they thus
bought were not equal to those the wholesale
sandwich-man offered for sale himself; and his
wholesale trade fell off, until now, I am told, he
has only two customers among street-sellers.</p>

<p>Ham sandwiches are made from any part of the
bacon which may be sufficiently lean, such as
“the gammon,” which now costs 4<i>d.</i> and 5<i>d.</i> the
pound. It is sometimes, but very rarely, picked
up at 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> When the trade was first started,
7<i>d.</i> a pound was paid for the ham, but the
sandwiches are now much larger. To make
three dozen a pound of meat is required, and
four quartern loaves. The “ham” may cost 5<i>d.</i>,
the bread 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, and the mustard 1<i>d.</i>
The proceeds for this would be 3<i>s.</i>, but the trade
is very precarious: little can be done in wet
weather. If unsold, the sandwiches spoil, for
the bread gets dry, and the ham loses its fresh
colour; so that those who depend upon this
trade are wretchedly poor. A first-rate week is
to clear 10<i>s.</i>; a good week is put at 7<i>s.</i>; and a
bad week at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> On some nights they do
not sell a dozen sandwiches. There are halfpenny
sandwiches, but these are only half the
size of those at a penny.</p>

<p>The persons carrying on this trade have been,
for the most part, in some kind of service&mdash;errand-boys,
pot-boys, foot-boys (or pages), or
lads engaged about inns. Some few have been
mechanics. Their average weekly earnings
hardly exceed 5<i>s.</i>, but some “get odd jobs”
at other things.</p>

<p>“There are now, sir, at the theatres this (the
Strand) side the water, and at Ashley’s, the
Surrey, and the Vic., two dozen and nine sandwiches.”
So said one of the trade, who counted
up his brethren for me. This man calculated
also that at the Standard, the saloons, the concert-rooms,
and at Limehouse, Mile-end, Bethnal-green-road,
and elsewhere, there might be
more than as many again as those “working”
the theatres&mdash;or 70 in all. They are nearly all
men, and no boys or girls are now in the trade.
The number of these people, when the large
theatres were open with the others, was about
double what it is now.</p>

<p>The information collected shows that the
expenditure in ham-sandwiches, supplied by
street-sellers, is 1,820<i>l.</i> yearly, and a consumption
of 436,800 sandwiches.</p>

<p>To start in the ham-sandwich street-trade
requires 2<i>s.</i> for a basket, 2<i>s.</i> for kettle to boil
ham in, 6<i>d.</i> for knife and fork, 2<i>d.</i> for mustard-pot
and spoon, 7<i>d.</i> for &frac12; cwt. of coals, 5<i>s.</i> for
ham, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for bread, 4<i>d.</i> for mustard, 9<i>d.</i> for
basket, cloth, and apron, 4<i>d.</i> for over-sleeves&mdash;or
a capital of 12<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Ham Sandwich-seller.</span></h3>

<p>A young man gave me the following account.
His look and manners were subdued; and,
though his dress was old and worn, it was clean
and <span class="lock">unpatched:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I hardly remember my father, sir,” he said;
“but I believe, if he’d lived, I should have been
better off. My mother couldn’t keep my brother
and me&mdash;he’s older than me&mdash;when we grew to
be twelve or thirteen, and we had to shift for
ourselves. She works at the stays, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
makes only 3<i>s.</i> a week, and we can’t help her.
I was first in place as a sort of errand-boy, then
I was a stationer’s boy, and then a news agent’s
boy. I wasn’t wanted any longer, but left with
a good character. My brother had gone into the
sandwich trade&mdash;I hardly know what made him&mdash;and
he advised me to be a ham sandwich-man,
and so I started as one. At first, I made 10<i>s.</i>,
and 7<i>s.</i>, and 8<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;that’s seven years,
or so&mdash;but things are worse now, and I make
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> some weeks, and 5<i>s.</i> others, and 6<i>s.</i> is an
out-and-outer. My rent’s 2<i>s.</i> a week, but I
haven’t my own things. I am so sick of this
life, I’d do anything to get out of it; but I don’t
see a way. Perhaps I might have been more
careful when I was first in it; but, really, if you
do make 10<i>s.</i> a week, you want shoes, or a shirt&mdash;so
what is 10<i>s.</i> after all? I wish I had it now,
though. I used to buy my sandwiches at 6<i>d.</i> a
dozen, but I found that wouldn’t do; and now I
buy and boil the stuff, and make them myself.
What <i>did</i> cost 6<i>d.</i>, now only costs me 4<i>d.</i> or 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>
I work the theatres this side of the water, chiefly
the ’Lympic and the ’Delphi. The best theatre
I ever had was the Garding, when it had two
galleries, and was dramatic&mdash;the operas there
wasn’t the least good to me. The Lyceum was
good, when it was Mr. Keeley’s. I hardly know
what sort my customers are, but they’re those
that go to theaytres: shopkeepers and clerks, I
think. Gentlemen don’t often buy of me. They
<i>have</i> bought, though. Oh, no, they never give a
farthing over; they’re more likely to want seven
for 6<i>d.</i> The women of the town buy of me, when
it gets late, for themselves and their fancy men.
They’re liberal enough when they’ve money.
They sometimes treat a poor fellow in a public-house.
In summer I’m often out ’till four in
the morning, and then must lie in bed half next
day. The ’Delphi was better than it is. I’ve
taken 3<i>s.</i> at the first “turn out” (the leaving
the theatre for a short time after the first piece),
“but the turn-outs at the Garding was better
than that. A penny pie-shop has spoiled us at
the ’Delphi and at Ashley’s. I go out between
eight and nine in the evening. People often want
more in my sandwiches, though I’m starving on
them. ‘Oh,’ they’ll say, ‘you’ve been ’prenticed
to Vauxhall, you have.’ ‘They’re 1<i>s.</i>
there,’ says I, ‘and no bigger. I haven’t Vauxhall
prices.’ I stand by the night-houses when
it’s late&mdash;not the fashionables. Their customers
would’nt look at me; but I’ve known women,
that carried their heads very high, glad to get a
sandwich afterwards. Six times I’ve been upset
by drunken fellows, on purpose, I’ve no doubt,
and lost all my stock. Once, a gent. kicked my
basket into the dirt, and he was going off&mdash;for
it was late&mdash;but some people by began to make
remarks about using a poor fellow that way, so
he paid for all, after he had them counted. I am
<i>so</i> sick of this life, sir. I <i>do</i> dread the winter so.
I’ve stood up to the ankles in snow till after
midnight, and till I’ve wished I was snow myself,
and could melt like it and have an end. I’d do
anything to get away from this, but I can’t.
Passion Week’s another dreadful time. It drives
us to starve, just when we want to get up a little
stock-money for Easter. I’ve been bilked by
cabmen, who’ve taken a sandwich; but, instead
of paying for it, have offered to fight me. There’s
no help. We’re knocked about sadly by the
police. Time’s very heavy on my hands, sometimes,
and that’s where you feel it. I read a bit,
if I can get anything to read, for I was at St.
Clement’s school; or I walk out to look for a
job. On summer-days I sell a trotter or two.
But mine’s a wretched life, and so is most ham
sandwich-men. I’ve no enjoyment of my youth,
and no comfort.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir! I live very poorly. A ha’porth
or a penn’orth of cheap fish, which I cook
myself, is one of my treats&mdash;either herrings or
plaice&mdash;with a ’tatur, perhaps. Then there’s a
sort of meal, now and then, off the odds and ends
of the ham, such as isn’t quite viewy enough for
the public, along with the odds and ends of the
loaves. I can’t boil a bit of greens with my
ham, ’cause I’m afraid it might rather spoil the
colour. I don’t slice the ham till it’s cold&mdash;it
cuts easier, and is a better colour then, I think.
I wash my aprons, and sleeves, and cloths myself,
and iron them too. A man that sometimes
makes only 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and sometimes less,
and must pay 2<i>s.</i> rent out of that, must look
after every farthing. I’ve often walked eight
miles to see if I could find ham a halfpenny
a pound cheaper anywhere. If it was tainted,
I know it would be flung in my face. If I
was sick there’s only the parish for me.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Bread.</span></h3>

<p>The street-trade in bread is not so extensive as
might be expected, from the universality of the
consumption. It is confined to Petticoat-lane
and the poorer districts in that neighbourhood.
A person who has known the East-end of town
for nearly fifty years, told me that as long as
he could recollect, bread was sold in the streets,
but not to the present extent. In 1812 and
1813, when bread was the dearest, there was
very little sold in the streets. At that time,
and until 1815, the Assize Acts, regulating the
bread-trade, were in force, and had been in force
in London since 1266. Previously to 1815 bakers
were restricted, by these Acts, to the baking of
three kinds of bread&mdash;wheaten, standard wheaten,
and household. The wheaten was made
of the best flour, the standard wheaten of the
different kinds of flour mixed together, and the
household of the coarser and commoner flour.
In 1823, however, it was enacted that within
the City of London and ten miles round, “it
shall be lawful for the bakers to make and
sell bread made of wheat, barley, rye, oats,
buck-wheat, Indian-corn, peas, beans, rice, or
potatoes, or any of them, along with common
salt, pure-water, eggs, milk, barm-leaven, potato,
or other yeast, and mixed in such proportions
as they shall think fit.” I mention this
because my informant, as well as an old
master baker with whom I conversed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
subject, remembered that every now and then,
after 1823, but only for two or three years,
some speculative trader, both in shops and in
the streets, would endeavour to introduce an inferior,
but still a wholesome, bread, to his customers,
such as an admixture of barley with
wheat-flour, but no one&mdash;as far as I could learn&mdash;persevered
in the speculation for more than a
week or so. Their attempts were not only unsuccessful
but they met with abuse, from street-buyers
especially, for endeavouring to palm off
“brown” bread as “good enough for poor
people.” One of my elder informants remembered
his father telling him that in 1800 and
1801, George III. had set the example of eating
brown bread at his one o’clock dinner, but
he was sometimes assailed as he passed in his
carriage, with the reproachful epithet of
“<i>Brown</i> George.” This feeling continues, for
the poor people, and even the more intelligent
working-men, if cockneys, have still a notion that
only “white” bread is fit for consumption. Into
the question of the relative nutrition of breads,
I shall enter when I treat of the bakers.</p>

<p>During a period of about four months in
the summer, there are from twenty to thirty
men daily selling stale bread. Of these only
twelve sell it regularly every day of the year,
and they trade chiefly on their own account.
Of the others, some are sent out by their
masters, receiving from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> for their
labour. Those who sell on their own account,
go round to the bakers’ shops about Stepney,
Mile-end, and Whitechapel, and purchase the
stale-bread on hand. It is sold to them at &frac12;<i>d.</i>,
1<i>d.</i> and 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per quartern less than the retail shop
price; but when the weather is very hot, and
the bakers have a large quantity of stale-bread
on hand, the street-sellers sometimes get the
bread at 2<i>d.</i> a quartern less than the retail price.
All the street-sellers of bread have been brought
up as bakers. Some have resorted to the street-trade,
I am told, when unable to procure work;
others because it is a less toilsome, and sometimes
a more profitable means of subsistence,
than the labour of an operative baker. It is
very rarely that any of the street-traders leave
their calling to resume working as journeymen.
Some of these traders have baskets containing
the bread offered for street-sale; others have
barrows, and one has a barrow resembling a
costermonger’s, with a long basket made to fit
upon it. The dress of these vendors is a light
coat of cloth or fustian; corduroy, fustian, or
cloth trousers, and a cloth cap or a hat, the
whole attire being, what is best understood as
“dusty,” ingrained as it is with flour.</p>

<p>From one bread-seller, a middle-aged man,
with the pale look and habitual stoop of a journeyman
baker, I had the following account:</p>

<p>“I’ve known the street-trade a few years;
I can’t say exactly how many. I was a journeyman
baker before that, and can’t say but what
I had pretty regular employment; but then, sir,
what an employment it is! So much night-work,
and the heat of the oven, with the close
air, and sleeping on sacks at nights (for you can’t
leave the place), so that altogether it’s a slave’s
life. A journeyman baker hasn’t what can be
called a home, for he’s so much away at the
oven; he’d better not be a married man, for
if his wife isn’t very careful there’s talk, and
there’s unhappiness about nothing perhaps. I
can’t be thought to speak feelingly that way
though, for I’ve been fortunate in a wife. But
a journeyman baker’s life drives him to drink,
almost whether he will or not. A street life’s
not quite so bad. I was out of work two or three
weeks, and I certainly lushed too much, and
can’t say as I tried very hard to get work, but
I had a pound or two in hand, and then I began
to think I’d try and sell stale bread in the
streets, for it’s a healthfuller trade than the
other; so I started, and have been at it ever
since, excepting when I work a few days, or
weeks, for a master baker; but he’s a relation,
and I assist him when he’s ill. My customers
are all poor persons,&mdash;some in rags, and some as
decent as their bad earnings’ll let them. No
doubt about it, sir, there’s poor women buy of
me that’s wives of mechanics working slop, and
that’s forced to live on stale bread. Where there’s
a family of children, stale bread goes so very
much further. I think I sell to few but what has
families, for a quartern’s too much at a time for
a single woman. I often hear my customers talk
about their children, and say they must make
haste, as the poor things are hungry, and they
couldn’t get them any bread sooner. O, it’s a
hard fight to live, all Spitalfields and Bethnal-green
way, for I know it all. There are first
the journeyman bakers over-worked and fretted
into drinking, a-making the bread, and there
are the poor fellows in all sorts of trade over-worked
to get money to buy it. I’ve had women
that looked as if they was ‘reduced,’ come to
me of an evening as soon as it was dusk, and
buy stale bread, as if they was ashamed to be
seen. Yes, I give credit. Some has a week’s
credit regular, and pays every Saturday night.
I lose very little in trusting. I sometimes have
bread over and sell it&mdash;rather than hold it over
to next day&mdash;for half what it cost me. I have
given it away to begging people, sooner than
keep it to be too stale, and they would get
something for it at a lodging-house. The
lodging-house keepers never buy of me that
I know of. They can buy far cheaper than I
can&mdash;you understand, sir. Perhaps, altogether,
I make about a guinea every week; wet weather
and short days are against me. I don’t sell more,
I think, on a Saturday than on other nights.
The nights are much of a muchness that way.”</p>

<p>The average quantity sold by each vendor
during the summer months is 150 quarterns
daily, usually at 4<i>d.</i>, but occasionally at 3<i>d.</i> the
quartern. One man informed me that he had sold
in one day 350 quarterns, receiving 5<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
for them.</p>

<p>The number of men (for if there be women
they are the men’s wives) engaged daily throughout
the year in the street-sale of bread is 12.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
These sell upon an average 100 quarterns each
per day: taking every day in the year 1<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>
each (a few being sold at 3<i>d.</i>)</p>

<p>Calculating then the four months’ trade in
summer at 150 quarterns per day per man, and
reckoning 15 men so selling, and each receiving
45<i>s.</i> (thus allowing for the threepenny sale); and
taking the receipts of the 12 regular traders at
1<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> per day, we find nearly 9,000<i>l.</i> annually
expended in the street purchase of 700,000
quartern loaves of bread. The profits of the
sellers vary from 1<i>l.</i> to 2<i>l.</i> a week, according to
the extent of their business.</p>

<p>To start in this branch of the street-trade a
capital is required according to the following
rate:&mdash;Stock-money for bread, average 1<i>l.</i>;
(largest amount required, 5<i>l.</i>; smallest, 10<i>s.</i>);
a basket, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Of those who are employed in
the summer, one-half have baskets, and the
other half bakers’ barrows; while of those who
attend the year through, 8 have baskets at
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, 3 have barrows at 40<i>s.</i> each, and one
a barrow and the long basket, before mentioned.
The barrow costs 30<i>s.</i>, and the basket 2<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Hot Green
Peas.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of hot green peas in the streets is of
great antiquity, that is to say, if the cry of “hot
peas-cod,” recorded by Lydgate (and formerly
alluded to), may be taken as having intimated
the sale of the same article. In many parts
of the country it is, or was, customary to have
“<i>scaldings</i> of peas,” often held as a sort of
rustic feast. The peas were not shelled, but
boiled in the pod, and eaten by the pod being
dipped in melted butter, with a little pepper,
salt, and vinegar, and then drawn through the
teeth to extract the peas, the pod being thrown
away. The mention of <i>peas-cod</i> (or pea-shell)
by Lydgate renders it probable that the “scalding”
method was that then in use in the streets.
None of the street-sellers, however, whom I saw,
remembered the peas being vended in any other
form than shelled and boiled as at present.</p>

<p>The sellers of green peas have no stands, but
carry a round or oval tin pot or pan, with a
swing handle; the pan being wrapped round
with a thick cloth, to retain the heat. The peas
are served out with a ladle, and eaten by the
customers, if eaten in the street, out of basins,
provided with spoons, by the pea-man. Salt,
vinegar, and pepper, are applied from the vendor’s store,
at the customer’s discretion.</p>

<p>There are now four men carrying on this
trade. They wear no particular dress, “just
what clothes we can get,” said one of them.
One, who has been in the trade twenty-five years,
was formerly an inn-porter; the other three are
ladies’ shoemakers in the day-time, and pea-sellers
in the evening, or at early morning, in any
market. Their average sale is three gallons
daily, with a receipt of 7<i>s.</i> per man. Seven
gallons a day is accounted a large sale; but
the largest of all is at Greenwich fair, when
each pea-man will take 35<i>s.</i> in a day. Each
vendor has his district. One takes Billingsgate,
Rosemary-lane, and its vicinity; another, the
Old Clothes Exchange, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch,
and Bethnal-green; a third, Mile-end and Stepney;
and a fourth, Ratcliffe-highway, Limehouse,
and Poplar. Each man resides in his
“round,” for the convenience of boiling his
peas, and introducing them to his customers
“hot and hot.”</p>

<p>The peas used in this traffic are all the dried
field pea, but dried green and whole, and not
split, or prepared, as are the yellow peas for
soup or puddings. They are purchased at the
corn-chandlers’ or the seed-shops, the price
being 2<i>s.</i> the peck (or two gallons.) The peas
are soaked before they are boiled, and swell considerably,
so that one gallon of the dried peas
makes rather more than two gallons of the boiled.
The hot green peas are sold in halfpennyworths;
a halfpennyworth being about a quarter of a
pint. The cry of the sellers is, “Hot green
peas! all hot, all hot! Here’s your peas hot,
hot, hot!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Hot Green Pea
Seller.</span></h3>

<p>The most experienced man in the trade gave me
the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Come the 25th of March, sir, and I shall have
been 26 years in the business, for I started it on
the 25th of March&mdash;it’s a day easy for to remember,
’cause everybody knows it’s quarter-day&mdash;in
1825. I was a porter in coaching-inns
before; but there was a mishap, and I had to
drop it. I didn’t leave ’cause I thought the pea
line might be better, but because I must do
something, and knew a man in the trade, and all
about it. It was a capital trade then, and for a
good many years after I was in it. Many a day
I’ve taken a guinea, and, sometimes, 35<i>s.</i>; and
I have taken two guineas at Greenwich Fair, but
then I worked till one or two in the morning from
eleven the day before. Money wasn’t so scarce
then. Oh, sir, as to what my profit was or is, I
never tell. I wouldn’t to my own wife; neither
her that’s living nor her that’s dead.” [A person
present intimated that the secret might be
safely confided to the dead wife, but the pea-seller
shook his head.] “Now, one day with
another, except Sundays, when I don’t work, I
may take 7<i>s.</i> I always use the dried peas. They
pay better than fresh garden-peas would at a groat
a peck. People has asked for young green peas,
but I’ve said that I didn’t have them. Billingsgate’s
my best ground. I sell to the costers, and
the roughs, and all the parties that has their dinners
in the tap-rooms&mdash;they has a bit of steak, or
a bit of cold meat they’ve brought with them.
There’s very little fish eat in Billingsgate, except,
perhaps, at the ord’n’ries (ordinaries). I’m
looked for as regular as dinner-time. The landlords
tell me to give my customers plenty of
pepper and salt, to make them thirsty. I go on
board the Billingsgate ships, too, and sometimes
sell 6<i>d.</i> worth to captain and crew. It’s a treat,
after a rough voyage. Oh, no, sir, I never go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
board the Dutch eel-vessels. There’s nothing
to be got out of scaly fur’ners (foreigners.) I
sell to the herring, and mackarel, and oyster-boats,
when they’re up. My great sale is in
public-houses, but I sometimes sell 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i>
worth to private houses. I go out morning,
noon, and night; and at night I go my round
when people’s having a bite of supper, perhaps,
in the public-houses. I sell to the women of the
town then. Yes, I give them credit. To-night,
now (Saturday), I expect to receive 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, or
near on to it, that I’ve trusted them this week.
They mostly pay me on a Saturday night. I
lose very little by them. I’m knocked about in
public-houses by the Billingsgate roughs, and
I’ve been bilked by the prigs. I’ve known at
least six people try my trade, and fail in it, and
I was glad to see them broke. I sell twice as
much in cold weather as in warm.”</p>

<p>I ascertained that my informant sold three
times as much as the other dealers, who confine
their trade principally to an evening round.
Reckoning that the chief man of business sells
3 gallons a day (which, at 1<i>d.</i> the quarter-pint,
would be 8<i>s.</i>, my informant said 7<i>s.</i>), and that
the other three together sell the same quantity,
we find a street-expenditure on hot green peas of
250<i>l.</i> and a street consumption of 1870 gallons.
The peas, costing 2<i>s.</i> the two gallons, are
vended for 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i>, at the least, as they boil
into more than double the quantity, and a gallon,
retail, is 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the addition of vinegar,
pepper, &amp;c., may reduce the profit to cent. per
cent., while there is the heaping up of every
measure retail to reduce the profit. Thus, independent
of any consideration as to the labour in
boiling, &amp;c. (generally done by the women), the
principal man’s profit is 21<i>s.</i> a week; that of
the others 7<i>s.</i> each weekly.</p>

<p>The capital required to start in the business
is&mdash;can, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; vinegar-bottle and pepper-box,
4<i>d.</i>; saucers and spoons, 6<i>d.</i>; stock-money,
about 2<i>s.</i>; cloth to wrap over the peas, 4<i>d.</i>
(a vendor wearing out a cloth in three months);
or an average of 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Cats’ and Dogs’-meat Dealers.</span></h3>

<p>The supply of food for cats and dogs is far
greater than may be generally thought. “Vy,
sir,” said one of the dealers to me, “can you
tell me ’ow many people’s in London?” On
my replying, upwards of two millions; “I don’t
know nothing vatever,” said my informant,
“about millions, but I think there’s a cat to
every ten people, aye, and more than that; and
so, sir, you can reckon.” [I told him this gave
a total of 200,000 cats in London; but the number
of inhabited houses in the metropolis was
100,000 more than this, and though there was
not a cat to every house, still, as many lodgers
as well as householders kept cats, I added that
I thought the total number of cats in London
might be taken at the same number as the inhabited
houses, or 300,000 in all.] “There’s not
near half so many dogs as cats. I must know,
for they all knows me, and I sarves about 200 cats
and 70 dogs. Mine’s a middling trade, but some
does far better. Some cats has a hap’orth a day,
some every other day; werry few can afford a
penn’orth, but times is inferior. Dogs is better
pay when you’ve a connection among ’em.”</p>

<p>The cat and dogs’-meat dealers, or “carriers,”
as they call themselves, generally purchase the
meat at the knackers’ (horse-slaughterers’)
yards. There are upwards of twenty of such
yards in London; three or four are in Whitechapel,
one in Wandsworth, two in Cow-cross&mdash;one
of the two last mentioned is the largest
establishment in London&mdash;and there are two
about Bermondsey. The proprietors of these
yards purchase live and dead horses. They contract
for them with large firms, such as brewers,
coal-merchants, and large cab and ’bus yards,
giving so much per head for their old live
and dead horses through the year. The price
varies from 2<i>l.</i> to 50<i>s.</i> the carcass. The knackers
also have contractors in the country (harness-makers
and others), who bring or send up to
town for them the live and dead stock of those
parts. The dead horses are brought to the yard&mdash;two
or three upon one cart, and sometimes five.
The live ones are tied to the tail of these
carts, and behind the tail of each other. Occasionally
a string of fourteen or fifteen are
brought up, head to tail, at one time. The live
horses are purchased merely for slaughtering.
If among the lot bought there should chance
to be one that is young, but in bad condition, it is
placed in the stable, fed up, and then put into the
knacker’s carts, or sold by them, or let on hire.
Occasionally a fine horse has been rescued from
death in this manner. One person is known to
have bought an animal for 15<i>s.</i>, for which he
afterwards got 150<i>l.</i> Frequently young horses
that will not work in cabs&mdash;such as “jibs”&mdash;are
sold to the horse-slaughterers as useless. They
are kept in the yard, and after being well fed,
often turn out good horses. The live horses are
slaughtered by the persons called “knackers.”
These men get upon an average 4<i>s.</i> a day. They
begin work at twelve at night, because some of
the flesh is required to be boiled before six in the
morning; indeed, a great part of the meat is
delivered to the carriers before that hour. The
horse to be slaughtered has his mane clipped as
short as possible (on account of the hair, which
is valuable). It is then blinded with a piece of
old apron smothered in blood, so that it may not
see the slaughterman when about to strike. A
pole-axe is used, and a cane, to put an immediate
end to the animal’s sufferings. After the
animal is slaughtered, the hide is taken off, and
the flesh cut from the bones in large pieces.
These pieces are termed, according to the part
from which they are cut, hind-quarters, fore-quarters,
cram-bones, throats, necks, briskets,
backs, ribs, kidney pieces, hearts, tongues, liver
and lights. The bones (called “racks” by the
knackers) are chopped up and boiled, in order
to extract the fat, which is used for greasing
common harness, and the wheels of carts and
drags, &amp;c. The bones themselves are sold for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
manure. The pieces of flesh are thrown into large
coppers or pans, about nine feet in diameter and
four feet deep. Each of these pans will hold about
three good-sized horses. Sometimes two large
brewers’ horses will fill them, and sometimes as
many as four “poor” cab-horses may be put into
them. The flesh is boiled about an hour and 20
minutes for a “killed” horse, and from two hours
to two hours and 20 minutes for a dead horse
(a horse dying from age or disease). The flesh,
when boiled, is taken from the coppers, laid on
the stones, and sprinkled with water to cool it.
It is then weighed out in pieces of 112, 56, 28,
21, 14, 7, and 3&frac12; lbs. weight. These are either
taken round in a cart to the “carriers,” or, at
about five, the carriers call at the yard to purchase,
and continue doing so till twelve in the day.
The price is 14<i>s.</i> per cwt. in winter, and 16<i>s.</i> in
summer. The tripe is served out at 12 lb. for
6<i>d.</i> All this is for cats and dogs. The carriers
then take the meat round town, wherever their
“walk” may lie. They sell it to the public at
the rate of 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb., and in small pieces, on
skewers, at a farthing, a halfpenny, and a penny
each. Some carriers will sell as much as a
hundred-weight in a day, and about half a hundred-weight
is the average quantity disposed of
by the carriers in London. Some sell much
cheaper than others. These dealers will frequently
knock at the doors of persons whom
they have seen served by another on the previous
day, and show them that they can let them have
a larger quantity of meat for the same money.
The class of persons belonging to the business
are mostly those who have been unable to obtain
employment at their trade. Occasionally a person
is bred to it, having been engaged as a lad
by some carrier to go round with the barrow
and assist him in his business. These boys will,
after a time, find a “walk” for themselves, beginning
first with a basket, and ultimately rising
to a barrow. Many of the carriers give light
weight to the extent of 2 oz. and 4 oz. in the
pound. At one yard alone near upon 100
carriers purchase meat, and there are, upon
an average, 150 horses slaughtered there every
week. Each slaughter-house may be said to do,
one with another, 60 horses per week throughout
the year, which, reckoning the London
slaughter-houses at 12, gives a total of 720
horses killed every week in the metropolis, or, in
round numbers, 37,500 in the course of the year.</p>

<p>The London cat and dogs’-meat carriers or
sellers&mdash;nearly all men&mdash;number at the least
1,000.</p>

<p>The slaughtermen are said to reap large
fortunes very rapidly&mdash;indeed, the carriers
say they coin the money. Many of them retire
after a few years, and take large farms. One,
after 12 years’ business, retired with several
thousand pounds, and has now three large farms.
The carriers are men, women, and boys. Very
few women do as well as the men at it. The
carriers “are generally sad drunkards.” Out of
five hundred, it is said three hundred at least
spend 1<i>l.</i> a head a week in drink. One party in
the trade told me that he knew a carrier who
would often spend 10<i>s.</i> in liquor at one sitting.
The profit the carriers make upon the meat is at
present only a penny per pound. In the summer
time the profit per pound is reduced to a halfpenny,
owing to the meat being dearer on account
of its scarcity. The carriers give a great
deal of credit&mdash;indeed, they take but little ready
money. On some days they do not come home
with more than 2<i>s.</i> One with a middling walk
pays for his meat 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day. For this he
has half a hundred-weight. This produces him
as much as 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, so that his profit is 4<i>s.</i>;
which, I am assured, is about a fair average
of the earnings of the trade. One carrier is
said to have amassed 1,000<i>l.</i> at the business.
He usually sold from 1&frac12; to 2 cwt. every morning,
so that his profits were generally from
16<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> per day. But the trade is much
worse now. There are so many at it, they
say, that there is barely a living for any. A
carrier assured me that he seldom went less
than 30, and frequently 40 miles, through
the streets every day. The best districts are
among the houses of tradesmen, mechanics,
and labourers. The coachmen in the mews at
the back of the squares are very good customers.
“The work lays thicker there,” said
my informant. Old maids are bad, though very
plentiful, customers. They cheapen the carriers
down so, that they can scarcely live at the business.
“They will pay one halfpenny and owe
another, and forget that after a day or two.” The
cats’ meat dealers generally complain of their
losses from bad debts. Their customers require
credit frequently to the extent of 1<i>l.</i> “One
party owes me 15<i>s.</i> now,” said a carrier to me,
“and many 10<i>s.</i>; in fact, very few people pay
ready money for the meat.”</p>

<p>The carriers frequently serve as much as ten
pennyworths to one person in a day. One gentleman
has as much as 4 lbs. of meat each morning
for two Newfoundland dogs; and there was one
woman&mdash;a black&mdash;who used to have as much as
16 pennyworth every day. This person used to
get out on the roof of the house and throw it
to the cats on the tiles. By this she brought so
many stray cats round about the neighbourhood,
that the parties in the vicinity complained; it
was quite a nuisance. She <i>would</i> have the meat
always brought to her before ten in the morning,
or else she would send to a shop for it, and
between ten and eleven in the morning the noise
and cries of the hundreds of stray cats attracted
to the spot was “terrible to hear.” When the
meat was thrown to the cats on the roof, the
riot, and confusion, and fighting, was beyond
description. “A beer-shop man,” I was told,
“was obliged to keep five or six dogs to drive
the cats from his walls.” There was also a mad
woman in Islington, who used to have 14 lbs.
of meat a day. The party who supplied her
had his money often at 2<i>l.</i> and 3<i>l.</i> at a time.
She had as many as thirty cats at times in her
house. Every stray one that came she would
take in and support. The stench was so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that she was obliged to be ejected. The best
days for the cats’ meat business are Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Saturdays. A double quantity
of meat is sold on the Saturday; and on that day
and Monday and Tuesday the weekly customers
generally pay.</p>

<p>“My father was a baker by trade,” said a
carrier to me, “but through an enlargement of
the heart he was obliged to give up working
at his trade; leaning over the trough increased
his complaint so severely, that he used to
fall down, and be obliged to be brought home.
This made him take to the cats’ and dogs’ meat
trade, and he brought me up to it. I do pretty
comfortably. I have a very good business,
having been all my life at it. If it wasn’t for
the bad debts I should do much better; but
some of the people I trust leave the houses, and
actually take in a double quantity of meat the
day before. I suppose there is at the present
moment as much as 20<i>l.</i> owing to me that I
never expect to see a farthing of.”</p>

<p>The generality of the dealers wear a shiny
hat, black plush waistcoat and sleeves, a blue
apron, corduroy trousers, and a blue and white
spotted handkerchief round their necks. Some,
indeed, will wear two and three handkerchiefs
round their necks, this being fashionable among
them. A great many meet every Friday afternoon
in the donkey-market, Smithfield, and
retire to a public-house adjoining, to spend the
evening.</p>

<p>A “cats’ meat carrier” who supplied me with
information was more comfortably situated than
any of the poorer classes that I have yet seen.
He lived in the front room of a second floor, in
an open and respectable quarter of the town,
and his lodgings were the perfection of comfort
and cleanliness in an humble sphere. It was
late in the evening when I reached the house.
I found the “carrier” and his family preparing
for supper. In a large morocco leather
easy chair sat the cats’ meat carrier himself;
his “blue apron and black shiny hat” had
disappeared, and he wore a “dress” coat and
a black satin waistcoat instead. His wife, who
was a remarkably pretty woman, and of very
attractive manners, wore a “Dolly Varden” cap,
placed jauntily at the back of her head, and a
drab merino dress. The room was cosily carpeted,
and in one corner stood a mahogany “crib”
with cane-work sides, in which one of the children
was asleep. On the table was a clean white
table-cloth, and the room was savoury with the
steaks, and mashed potatoes that were cooking
on the fire. Indeed, I have never yet seen
greater comfort in the abodes of the poor. The
cleanliness and wholesomeness of the apartment
were the more striking from the unpleasant
associations connected with the calling.</p>

<p>It is believed by one who has been engaged
at the business for 25 years, that there are from
900 to 1,000 horses, averaging 2 cwt. of meat
each&mdash;little and big&mdash;boiled down every week;
so that the quantity of cats’ and dogs’ meat used
throughout London is about 200,000 lbs. per
week, and this, sold at the rate of 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb.,
gives 2,000<i>l.</i> a week for the money spent in
cats’ and dogs’ meat, or upwards of 100,000<i>l.</i> a
year, which is at the rate of 100<i>l.</i>-worth sold
annually by each carrier. The profits of the
carriers may be estimated at about 50<i>l.</i> each
per annum.</p>

<p>The capital required to start in this business
varies from 1<i>l.</i> to 2<i>l.</i> The stock-money needed
is between 5<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> The barrow and basket,
weights and scales, knife and steel, or black-stone,
cost about 2<i>l.</i> when new, and from 15<i>s.</i> to
4<i>s.</i> second-hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Drinkables.</span></h3>

<p>The street-sellers of the drinkables, who have
now to be considered, belong to the same class
as I have described in treating of the sale of
street-provisions generally. The buyers are
not precisely of the same class, for the street-eatables
often supply a meal, but with the exception
of the coffee-stalls, and occasionally
of the rice-milk, the drinkables are more of
a luxury than a meal. Thus the buyers are
chiefly those who have “a penny to spare,”
rather than those who have “a penny to dine
upon.” I have described the different classes
of purchasers of each potable, and perhaps the
accounts&mdash;as a picture of street-life&mdash;are even
more curious than those I have given of the
purchasers of the eatables&mdash;of (literally) the
diners <i>out</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Coffee-stall Keepers.</span></h3>

<p>The vending of tea and coffee, in the streets, was
little if at all known twenty years ago, saloop
being then the beverage supplied from stalls to
the late and early wayfarers. Nor was it until
after 1842 that the stalls approached to anything
like their present number, which is said to
be upwards of 300&mdash;the majority of the proprietors
being women. Prior to 1824, coffee
was in little demand, even among the smaller
tradesmen or farmers, but in that year the duty
having been reduced from 1<i>s.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> per lb., the
consumption throughout the kingdom in the next
seven years was nearly trebled, the increase being
from 7,933,041 lbs., in 1824, to 22,745,627 lbs.,
in 1831. In 1842, the duty on coffee, was fixed
at 4<i>d.</i>, from British possessions, and from foreign
countries at 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>But it was not owing solely to the reduced
price of coffee, that the street-vendors of it increased
in the year or two subsequent to 1842, at
least 100 per cent. The great facilities then
offered for a cheap adulteration, by mixing
ground chicory with the ground coffee, was an
enhancement of the profits, and a greater temptation
to embark in the business, as a smaller
amount of capital would suffice. Within these
two or three years, this cheapness has been
still further promoted, by the medium of
adulteration, the chicory itself being, in its
turn, adulterated by the admixture of baked
carrots, and the like saccharine roots, which, of
course, are not subjected to any duty, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
foreign chicory is charged 6<i>d.</i> per lb. English
chicory is not chargeable with duty, and is now
cultivated, I am assured, to the yield of between
4,000 and 5,000 tons yearly, and this
nearly all used in the adulteration of coffee.
Nor is there greater culpability in this trade
among street-venders, than among “respectable”
shopkeepers; for I was assured, by a
leading grocer, that he could not mention
twenty shops in the city, of which he could say:
“You can go and buy a pound of ground coffee
there, and it will not be adulterated.” The
revelations recently made on this subject by the
<i>Lancet</i> are a still more convincing proof of the
<i>general</i> dishonesty of grocers.</p>

<p>The coffee-stall keepers generally stand at
the corner of a street. In the fruit and meat
markets there are usually two or three coffee-stalls,
and one or two in the streets leading to
them; in Covent-garden there are no less than
four coffee-stalls. Indeed, the stalls abound in
all the great thoroughfares, and the most in
those not accounted “fashionable” and great
“business” routes, but such as are frequented
by working people, on their way to their day’s
labour. The best “pitch” in London is supposed
to be at the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street.
The proprietor of that stall is said to
take full 30<i>s.</i> of a morning, in halfpence. One
stall-keeper, I was informed, when “upon the
drink” thinks nothing of spending his 10<i>l.</i> or
15<i>l.</i> in a week. A party assured me that once,
when the stall-keeper above mentioned was away
“on the spree,” he took up his stand there, and
got from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> in the course of ten minutes,
at the busy time of the morning.</p>

<p>The coffee-stall usually consists of a spring-barrow,
with two, and occasionally four, wheels.
Some are made up of tables, and some have a tressel
and board. On the top of this are placed two
or three, and sometimes four, large tin cans, holding
upon an average five gallons each. Beneath
each of these cans is a small iron fire-pot, perforated
like a rushlight shade, and here charcoal
is continually burning, so as to keep the
coffee or tea, with which the cans are filled, hot
throughout the early part of the morning. The
board of the stall has mostly a compartment for
bread and butter, cake, and ham sandwiches,
and another for the coffee mugs. There is
generally a small tub under each of the stalls,
in which the mugs and saucers are washed.
The “grandest” stall in this line is the one
before-mentioned, as standing at the corner of
Duke-street, Oxford-street (of which an engraving
is here given). It is a large truck on four
wheels, and painted a bright green. The cans
are four in number, and of bright polished
tin, mounted with brass-plates. There are
compartments for bread and butter, sandwiches,
and cake. It is lighted by three large
oil lamps, with bright brass mountings, and
covered in with an oil-cloth roof. The coffee-stalls,
generally, are lighted by candle-lamps.
Some coffee-stalls are covered over with tarpaulin,
like a tent, and others screened from
the sharp night or morning air by a clothes-horse
covered with blankets, and drawn half
round the stall.</p>

<p>Some of the stall-keepers make their appearance
at twelve at night, and some not till three
or four in the morning. Those that come out
at midnight, are for the accommodation of the
“night-walkers”&mdash;“fast gentlemen” and loose
girls; and those that come out in the morning,
are for the accommodation of the working men.</p>

<p>It is, I may add, piteous enough to see
a few young and good-looking girls, some without
the indelible mark of habitual depravity
on their countenances, clustering together for
warmth round a coffee-stall, to which a penny
expenditure, or the charity of the proprietor, has
admitted them. The thieves do not resort to
the coffee-stalls, which are so immediately under
the eye of the policeman.</p>

<p>The coffee-stall keepers usually sell coffee
and tea, and some of them cocoa. They keep
hot milk in one of the large cans, and coffee,
tea, or cocoa in the others. They supply bread
and butter, or currant cake, in slices&mdash;ham
sandwiches, water-cresses, and boiled eggs. The
price is 1<i>d.</i> per mug, or &frac12;<i>d.</i> per half-mug, for
coffee, tea, or cocoa; and &frac12;<i>d.</i> a slice the bread
and butter or cake. The ham sandwiches are
2<i>d.</i> (or 1<i>d.</i>) each, the boiled eggs 1<i>d.</i>, and the
water-cresses a halfpenny a bunch. The coffee,
tea, cocoa, and sugar they generally purchase
by the single pound, at a grocer’s. Those who
do an extensive trade purchase in larger quantities.
The coffee is usually bought in the
berry, and ground by themselves. All purchase
chicory to mix with it. For the coffee
they pay about 1<i>s.</i>; for the tea about 3<i>s.</i>; for
the cocoa 6<i>d.</i> per lb.; and for the sugar 3&frac12;<i>d.</i>
to 4<i>d.</i> For the chicory the price is 6<i>d.</i> (which is
the amount of the duty alone on foreign chicory),
and it is mixed with the coffee at the rate of
6 ozs. to the pound; many use as much as 9 and
12 ozs. The coffee is made of a dark colour
by means of what are called “finings,” which
consist of burnt sugar&mdash;such, as is used for
browning soups. Coffee is the article mostly
sold at the stalls; indeed, there is scarcely
one stall in a hundred that is supplied with
tea, and not more than a dozen in all London
that furnish cocoa. The stall-keepers usually
make the cake themselves. A 4 lb. cake
generally consists of half a pound of currants,
half a pound of sugar, six ounces of
beef dripping, and a quartern of flour. The
ham for sandwiches costs 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> per lb.;
and when boiled produces in sandwiches about
2<i>s.</i> per lb. It is usually cut up in slices little
thicker than paper. The bread is usually “second
bread;” the butter, salt, at about 8<i>d.</i> the pound.
Some borrow their barrows, and pay 1<i>s.</i> a week
for the hire of them. Many borrow the capital
upon which they trade, frequently of their landlord.
Some get credit for their grocery&mdash;some
for their bread. If they borrow, they pay about
20 per cent. per week for the loan. I was told
of one man that makes a practice of lending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
money to the coffee-stall-keepers and other
hucksters, at the rate of at least 20 per cent. a
week. If the party wishing to borrow a pound
or two is unknown to the money-lender, he
requires security, and the interest to be paid
him weekly. This money-lender, I am informed,
has been transported once for receiving
stolen property, and would now purchase any
amount of plate that might be taken to him.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The class of persons usually belonging to
the business have been either cab-men, policemen,
labourers, or artisans. Many have been
bred to dealing in the streets, and brought up
to no other employment, but many have taken
to the business owing to the difficulty of obtaining
work at their own trade. The generality
of them are opposed to one another. I
asked one in a small way of business what was
the average amount of his profits, and his answer
was,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I usually buy 10 ounces of coffee a night.
That costs, when good, 1<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i> With this I
should make five gallons of coffee, such as I
sell in the street, which would require 3 quarts
of milk, at 3<i>d.</i> per quart, and 1&frac12; lb. of sugar, at
3&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb., there is some at 3<i>d.</i> This would
come to 2<i>s.</i> 2&frac34;<i>d.</i>; and, allowing 1&frac14;<i>d.</i> for a
quarter of a peck of charcoal to keep the coffee
hot, it would give 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the cost of five
gallons of coffee. This I should sell out at about
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per pint; so that the five gallons would
produce me 5<i>s.</i>, or 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> clear. I generally
get rid of one quartern loaf and 6 oz. of
butter with this quantity of coffee, and for
this I pay 5<i>d.</i> the loaf and 3<i>d.</i> the butter,
making 8<i>d.</i>; and these I make into twenty-eight
slices at &frac12;<i>d.</i> per slice; so the whole brings me
in 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, or about 6<i>d.</i> clear. Added to this,
I sell a 4 lb. cake, which costs me 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb.
1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> the entire cake; and this in twenty-eight
slices, at 1<i>d.</i> per slice, would yield 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,
or 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> clear; so that altogether my clear
gains would be 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> upon an expenditure of
2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>&mdash;say 200 per cent.”</p>

<p>This is said to be about the usual profit of the
trade. Sometimes they give credit. One person
assured me he trusted as much as 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> that
morning, and out of that he was satisfied there
was 4<i>d.</i>, at least, he should never see. Most of
the stalls are stationary, but some are locomotive.
Some cans are carried about with yokes, like
milk-cans, the mugs being kept in a basket.
The best district for the night-trade is the City,
and the approaches to the bridges. There are
more men and women, I was told, walking
along Cheapside, Aldersgate-street, Bishopsgate-street,
and Fleet-street. In the latter
place a good trade is frequently done between
twelve at night and two in the morning. For
the morning trade the best districts are the
Strand, Oxford-street, City-road, New-road
(from one end to the other), the markets, especially
Covent Garden, Billingsgate, Newgate,
and the Borough. There are no coffee-stalls
in Smithfield. The reason is that the drovers,
on arriving at the market, are generally tired
and cold, and prefer sitting down to their coffee
in a warm shop rather than drink it in the
open street. The best days for coffee-stalls are
market mornings, viz. Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday. On these days the receipts are generally
half as much again as those of the other
mornings. The best time of the year for the
business is the summer. This is, I am told,
because the workpeople and costermongers have
more money to spend. Some stall-keepers save
sufficient to take a shop, but these are only such
as have a “pitch” in the best thoroughfares.
One who did a little business informed me that
he usually cleared, including Sunday, 14<i>s.</i>&mdash;last
week his gains were 15<i>s.</i>; the week
before that he could not remember. He
is very frequently out all night, and does not
earn sixpence. This is on wet and cold nights,
when there are few people about. His is generally
the night-trade. The average weekly
earnings of the trade, throughout the year, are
said to be 1<i>l.</i> The trade, I am assured by all,
is overstocked. They are half too many, they
say. “Two of us,” to use their own words,
“are eating one man’s bread.” “When coffee
in the streets first came up, a man could go
and earn,” I am told, “his 8<i>s.</i> a night at the
very lowest; but now the same class of men
cannot earn more than 3<i>s.</i>” Some men may
earn comparatively a large sum, as much as
38<i>s.</i> or 2<i>l.</i>, but the generality of the trade cannot
make more than 1<i>l.</i> per week, if so much.
The following is the statement of one of the
<span class="lock">class:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was a mason’s labourer, a smith’s labourer,
a plasterer’s labourer, or a bricklayer’s labourer.
I was, indeed, a labouring man. I could not get
employment. I was for six months without any
employment. I did not know which way to support
my wife and child (I have only one child).
Being so long out of employment, I saw no other
means of getting a living but out of the streets.
I was almost starving before I took to it&mdash;that I
certainly was. I’m not ashamed of telling anybody
that, because it’s true, and I sought for a
livelihood wherever I could. Many said they
wouldn’t do such a thing as keep a coffee-stall,
but I said I’d do anything to get a bit of bread
honestly. Years ago, when I was a boy, I used
to go out selling water-cresses, and apples,
oranges, and radishes, with a barrow, for my
landlord; so I thought, when I was thrown out
of employment, I would take to selling coffee in
the streets. I went to a tinman, and paid him
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (the last of my savings, after I’d been
four or five months out of work) for a can,
I didn’t care how I got my living so long as
I could turn an honest penny. Well; I went
on, and knocked about, and couldn’t get a
pitch anywhere; but at last I heard that
an old man, who had been in the habit of
standing for many years at the entrance of one
of the markets, had fell ill; so, what did
I do, but I goes and pops into his pitch, and
there I’ve done better than ever I did afore. I
get 20<i>s.</i> now where I got 10<i>s.</i> one time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
if I only had such a thing as 5<i>l.</i> or 10<i>l.</i>, I
might get a good living for life. I cannot
do half as much as the man that was there
before me. He used to make his coffee down
there, and had a can for hot water as well;
but I have but one can to keep coffee and
all in; and I have to borrow my barrow,
and pay 1<i>s.</i> a week for it. If I sell my can out,
I can’t do any more. The struggle to get a
living is so great, that, what with one and another
in the coffee-trade, it’s only those as can
get good ‘pitches’ that can get a crust at it.”</p>

<p>As it appears that each coffee-stall keeper
on an average, clears 1<i>l.</i> a week, and his
takings may be said to be at least double that
sum, the yearly street expenditure for tea, coffee,
&amp;c., amounts to 31,200<i>l.</i> The quantity of
coffee sold annually in the streets, appears to
be about 550,000 gallons.</p>

<p>To commence as a coffee-stall keeper in a
moderate manner requires about 5<i>l.</i> capital.
The truck costs 2<i>l.</i>, and the other utensils and
materials 3<i>l.</i> The expense of the cans is near
upon 16<i>s.</i> each. The stock-money is a few
shillings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Ginger-beer,
Sherbet, Lemonade, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>The street-trade in ginger-beer&mdash;now a very
considerable traffic&mdash;was not known to any
extent until about thirty years ago. About
that time (1822) a man, during a most sultry
drought, sold extraordinary quantities of “cool
ginger-beer” and of “soda-powders,” near the
Royal Exchange, clearing, for the three or four
weeks the heat continued, 30<i>s.</i> a day, or 9<i>l.</i>
weekly. Soda-water he sold “in powders,”
the acid and the alkali being mixed in the
water of the glass held by the customer, and
drunk whilst effervescing. His prices were 2<i>d.</i>
and 3<i>d.</i> a glass for ginger-beer; and 3<i>d.</i> and
4<i>d.</i> for soda-water, “according to the quality;”
though there was in reality no difference whatever
in the quality&mdash;only in the price. From
that time, the numbers pursuing this street
avocation increased gradually; they have however
fallen off of late years.</p>

<p>The street-sellers who “brew their own beer”
generally prepare half a gross (six dozen) at
a time. For a “good quality” or the “penny
bottle” trade, the following are the ingredients
and the mode of preparation:&mdash;3 gallons of
water; 1 lb. of ginger, 6<i>d.</i>; lemon-acid, 2<i>d.</i>;
essence of cloves, 2<i>d.</i>; yeast, 2<i>d.</i>; and 1 lb. of
raw sugar, 7<i>d.</i> This admixture, the yeast being
the last ingredient introduced, stands 24 hours,
and is then ready for bottling. If the beverage
be required in 12 hours, double the quantity of
yeast is used. The bottles are filled only “to
the ridge,” but the liquid and the froth more
than fill a full-sized half-pint glass. “Only
half froth,” I was told, “is reckoned very fair,
and it’s just the same in the shops.” Thus, 72
bottles, each to be sold at 1<i>d.</i>, cost&mdash;apart from
any outlay in utensils, or any consideration of
the value of labour&mdash;only 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, and yield, at
1<i>d.</i> per bottle, 6<i>s.</i> For the cheaper beverage&mdash;called
“playhouse ginger-beer” in the trade&mdash;instead
of sugar, molasses from the “private
distilleries” is made available. The
“private” distilleries are the illicit ones:
“‘Jiggers,’ we call them,” said one man; “and
I could pass 100 in 10 minutes’ walk from where
we’re talking.” Molasses, costing 3<i>d.</i> at a jigger’s,
is sufficient for a half-gross of bottles of
ginger-beer; and of the other ingredients only
half the quantity is used, the cloves being altogether
dispensed with, but the same amount of
yeast is generally applied. This quality of
“beer” is sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the glass.</p>

<p>About five years ago “fountains” for the
production of ginger-beer became common in
the streets. The ginger-beer trade in the open
air is only for a summer season, extending from
four to seven months, according to the weather,
the season last year having been over in about
four months. There were then 200 fountains in
the streets, all of which, excepting 20 or 30 of
the best, were hired of the ginger-beer manufacturers,
who drive a profitable trade in them.
The average value of a street-fountain, with
a handsome frame or stand, which is usually
fixed on a wheeled and movable truck, so
as one man’s strength may be sufficient to
propel it, is 7<i>l.</i>; and, for the rent of such a
fountain, 6<i>s.</i> a week is paid when the season is
brisk, and 4<i>s.</i> when it is slack; but last summer,
I am told, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was an average. The largest
and handsomest ginger-beer fountain in London
was&mdash;I speak of last summer&mdash;in use at the
East-end, usually standing in Petticoat-lane,
and is the property of a dancing-master. It is
made of mahogany, and presents somewhat the
form of an upright piano on wheels. It has
two pumps, and the brass of the pump-handles
and the glass receivers is always kept bright
and clean, so that the whole glitters handsomely
to the light. Two persons “serve” at this
fountain; and on a fine Sunday morning, from
six to one, that being the best trading time, they
take 7<i>l.</i> or 8<i>l.</i> in halfpennies&mdash;for “the beer”
is &frac12;<i>d.</i> a glass&mdash;and 2<i>l.</i> each other day of the
week. This machine, as it may be called, is
drawn by two ponies, said to be worth 10<i>l.</i>
a-piece; and the whole cost is pronounced&mdash;perhaps
with a sufficient exaggeration&mdash;to have been
150<i>l.</i> There were, in the same neighbourhood,
two more fountains on a similar scale, but commoner,
each drawn by only one pony instead of
the aristocratic “pair.”</p>

<p>The ingredients required to feed the “ginger-beer”
fountains are of a very cheap description.
To supply 10 gallons, 2 quarts of lime-juice
(as it is called, but it is, in reality, lemon-juice),
costing 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, are placed in the recess,
sometimes with the addition of a pound of
sugar (4<i>d.</i>); while some, I am assured, put
in a smaller quantity of juice, and add two-pennyworth
of oil of vitriol, which “brings out
the sharpness of the lime-juice.” The rest
is water. No process of brewing or fermentation
is necessary, for the fixed air pumped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the liquid as it is drawn from the fountain,
communicates a sufficient briskness or effervescence.
“The harder you pumps,” said one
man who had worked a fountain, “the frothier
it comes; and though it seems to fill a big
glass&mdash;and the glass an’t so big for holding as
it looks&mdash;let it settle, and there’s only a quarter
of a pint.” The hirer of a fountain is required
to give security. This is not, as in some slop-trades,
a deposit of money; but a householder
must, by written agreement, make himself responsible
for any damage the fountain may sustain,
as well as for its return, or make good the
loss: the street ginger-beer seller is alone responsible
for the rent of the machine. It is
however, only men that are known, who are
trusted in this way. Of the fountains thus hired,
50 are usually to be found at the neighbouring
fairs and races. As the ginger-beer men carry
lime-juice, &amp;c., with them, only water is required
to complete the “brewing of the beer” and so
conveyance is not difficult.</p>

<p>There is another kind of “ginger-beer,” or
rather of “small acid tiff,” which is sold out
of barrels at street-stalls at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the glass. To
make 2&frac12; gallons of this, there is used 1/2lb. tartaric,
or other acid, 1<i>s.</i>; &frac12; lb. alkali (soda),
10<i>d.</i>; &frac12; lb. lump sugar, bruised fine, 4<i>d.</i>; and
yeast 1<i>d.</i> Of these “barrel-men” there are
now about one hundred.</p>

<p>Another class of street-sellers obtain their
stock of ginger-beer from the manufacturers.
One of the largest manufacturers for the street-trade
resides near Ratcliffe-highway, and another
in the Commercial-road. The charge by the
wholesale traders is 8<i>d.</i> the doz., while to a
known man, or for ready money, 13 are given
to the dozen. The beer, however, is often let
out on credit&mdash;or in some cases security is given
in the same way as for the fountains&mdash;and the
empty bottles must be duly returned. It is not
uncommon for two gross of beer to be let out
in this way at a time. For the itinerant trade
these are placed on a truck or barrow, fitted
up with four shelves, on which are ranged the
bottles. These barrows are hired in the same
way as the costers’ barrows. Some sell their
beer at stalls fitted up exclusively for the trade,
a kind of tank being let into the centre of the
board and filled with water, in which the glasses
are rinsed or washed. Underneath the stall
there is usually a reserve of the beer, and a keg
containing water. Some of the best frequented
stalls were in Whitechapel, Old-street-road, City-road,
Tottenham-court-road, the New-cut, Elephant
and Castle, the Commercial-road, Tower-hill,
the Strand, and near Westminster-bridge.</p>

<p>The stationary beer business is, for the most
part, carried on in the more public streets, such
as Holborn and Oxford-street, and in the markets
of Covent-garden, Smithfield, and Billingsgate;
while the peripatetic trade, which is
briskest on the Sundays&mdash;when, indeed, some of
the stationary hands become itinerant&mdash;is more
for the suburbs; Victoria-park, Battersea-fields,
Hampstead-heath, Primrose-hill, Kennington-common,
and Camberwell-green, being approved
Sunday haunts.</p>

<p>The London street-sellers of ginger-beer,
say the more experienced, may be computed at
3,000&mdash;of whom about one-third are women. I
heard them frequently estimated at 5,000, and
some urged that the number was at least as near
5,000 as 3,000. For my own part I am inclined
to believe that half the smaller number would
be nearer the truth. Judging by the number of
miles of streets throughout the metropolis, and
comparing the street-sellers of ginger-beer with
the fruit-stall keepers, I am satisfied that in
estimating the ginger-beer-sellers at 1,500 we
are rather over than under the truth. This
body of street-sellers were more numerous five
years back by 15 or 20 per cent., but the introduction
of the street fountains, and the trade
being resorted to by the keepers of coal-sheds
and the small shopkeepers&mdash;who have frequently
a stand with ginger-beer in front of their shops&mdash;have
reduced the amount of the street-sellers.
In 1842, there were 1,200 ginger-beer sellers in
the streets who had attached to their stalls or
trucks labels, showing that they were members&mdash;or
assumed to be members&mdash;of the Society
of Odd Fellows. This was done in hopes of a
greater amount of custom from the other members
of the Society, but the expectation was
not realised&mdash;and so the Odd Fellowship of
the ginger-beer people disappeared. Of the
street-traders 200 work fountains; and of the
remaining portion the stationary and the itinerant
are about equally divided. Of the whole
number, however, not above an eighth confine
themselves to the trade, but usually sell with
their “pop” some other article of open-air
traffic&mdash;fruit, sweet-stuff, or shell-fish. There
are of the entire number about 350, who, whenever
the weather permits, stay out all night
with their stands or barrows, and are to be found
especially in all the approaches to Covent-garden,
and the other markets to which there is a
resort during the night or at day-break. These
men, I was told by one of their body, worked
from eight in the evening to eight or ten next
morning, then went to bed, rose at three, and
“plenty of ’em then goes to the skittles or to
get drunk.”</p>

<p>The character of the ginger-beer-sellers does
not differ from what I have described as pertaining
to the costermonger class, and to street-traders
generally. There is the same admixture
of the reduced mechanic, the broken-down
gentleman’s servant, the man of any class in
life who cannot brook the confinement and restraint
of ordinary in-door labour, and of the
man “brought up to the streets.” One experienced
and trustworthy man told me that
from his own knowledge he could count up
twenty “classical men,” as he styled them,
who were in the street ginger-beer-trade, and of
these four had been, or were said to have been
“parsons,” two being of the same name (Mr.
S &mdash;&mdash;); but my informant did not know if
they stood in any degree of consanguinity one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to another. The women are the wives, daughters,
or other connections of the men.</p>

<p>Some of the stalls at which ginger-beer is sold&mdash;and
it is the same at the coal-sheds and
the chandlers’ shops&mdash;are adorned pictorially.
Erected at the end of a stall is often a painting,
papered on a board, in which a gentleman, with
the bluest of coats, the whitest of trousers, the
yellowest of waistcoats, and the largest of guard-chains
or eye-glasses, is handing a glass of ginger-beer,
frothed up like a pot of stout, and
containing, apparently, a pint and a half, to
some lady in flowing white robes, or gorgeous
in purple or orange.</p>

<p>To commence in this branch of the street
business requires, in all 18<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>: six glasses,
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; board, 5<i>s.</i>; tank, 1<i>s.</i>; keg, 1<i>s.</i>; gross of
beer, 8<i>s.</i> (this is where the seller is not also the
maker); and for towels, &amp;c., 6<i>d.</i>; if however
the street-seller brew his own beer, he will
require half a gross of bottles, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and the
ingredients I have enumerated, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i></p>

<p>In addition to the street-sale of ginger-beer is
that of other summer-drinks. Of these, the
principal is lemonade, the consumption of which
is as much as that of all the others together.
Indeed, the high-sounding names given to some
of these beverages&mdash;such as “Nectar” and
“Persian Sherbet”&mdash;are but other names for
lemonade, in a slightly different colour or
fashion.</p>

<p>Lemonade is made, by those vendors who deal
in the best articles, after the following method:
1 lb. of carbonate of soda, 6<i>d.</i>; 1 lb. of tartaric
acid, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> (“at least,” said an informant, “<i>I</i>
pay 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> at ’Pothecaries Hall, but it can be
had at 1<i>s.</i>”); 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>; essence
of lemon, 3<i>d.</i> This admixture is kept, in the
form of a powder, in a jar, and water is drawn
from what the street-sellers call a “stone-barrel”&mdash;which
is a stone jar, something like the
common-shaped filters, with a tap&mdash;and a larger
or smaller spoonful of the admixture in a glass
of water supplies an effervescing draught for 1<i>d.</i>
or &frac12;<i>d.</i> “There’s sometimes shocking roguishness
in the trade,” said one man, “and there is
in a many trades&mdash;some uses vitriol!” Lemonade,
made after the recipe I have given, is
sometimes bottled by the street-sellers, and sold
in the same way as ginger-beer. It is bought,
also, for street sale of the ginger-beer manufacturers&mdash;the
profit being the same&mdash;but so bought
to less than a twentieth of the whole sale. The
water in the stone barrel is spring-water, obtained
from the nearest pump, and in hot weather
obtained frequently, so as to be “served” in as
cool a state as possible. Sometimes lemonade
powders are used; they are bought at a chemist’s,
at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the pound. “Sherbet” is the
same admixture, with cream of tartar instead of
tartaric acid. “Raspberry” has, sometimes, the
addition of a few crusted raspberries, and a
colouring of cochineal, with, generally, a greater
degree of sweetening than lemonade. “If cochineal
is used for colouring,” said one man,
“it sometimes turns brown in the sun, and the
rasberry don’t sell. A little lake’s better.”
“Lemon-juice” is again lemonade, with a slight
infusion of saffron to give it a yellow or pale
orange colour. “Nectar,” in imitation of
Soyer’s, has more sugar and less acid than the
lemonade; spices, such as cinnamon, is used to
flavour it, and the colouring is from lake and
saffron.</p>

<p>These “cooling drinks” are sold from the
powder or the jar, as I have described, from
fountains, and from bottles. The fountain sale
is not above a tenth of the whole. All is sold in
&frac12;<i>d.</i> and 1<i>d.</i> glasses, except the nectar, which is
never less than 1<i>d.</i> The customers are the same
as those who buy ginger-beer; but one “lemonader”
with whom I conversed, seemed inclined
to insist that they were a “more respectabler
class.” Boys are good customers&mdash;better, perhaps,
than for the beer,&mdash;as “the colour and the
fine names attracts them.”</p>

<p>The “cooling drink” season, like that of the
ginger-beer, is determined by the weather, and
last summer it was only four months. It was
computed for me that there were 200 persons,
chiefly men, selling solely lemonade, &amp;c., and an
additional 300 uniting the sale with that of ginger-beer.
One man, whose statement was confirmed
by others, told me that on fine days he
took 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, out of which he cleared 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
and he concluded that his brother tradesmen
cleared as much every fine day, and so, allowing
for wet weather and diminished receipts, made
10<i>s.</i> a week. The receipts, then, for this street
luxury&mdash;a receipt of 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> affording a profit of
10<i>s.</i>&mdash;show a street expenditure in such a summer
as the last, of 2,800<i>l.</i>, by those who do not
unite ginger-beer with the trade. Calculating
that those who do unite ginger-beer with it sell
only one-half as much as the others, we find a
total outlay of 4,900<i>l.</i> One of the best trades
is in the hands of a man who “works” Smithfield,
and on the market days clears generally
from 6<i>s.</i> to 9<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The stalls, &amp;c., are of the same character as
those of the ginger-beer sellers. The capital
required to start is:&mdash;stone barrel, with brass
tap, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; stand and trestle, 6<i>s.</i>; 6 tumbler
glasses, 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; 2 towels, 6<i>d.</i>; stock money,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; jar, 2<i>s.</i>; 12 bottles (when used), 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
in all, about a guinea.</p>

<p>In showing the money expended in the ginger-beer
trade it must be borne in mind that a
large portion of the profits accrues to persons
who cannot be properly classed with the regular
street-traders. Such is the proprietor of the
great fountain of which I have spoken, who is
to be classed as a speculative man, ready to
embark capital in any way&mdash;whether connected
with street-traffic or not&mdash;likely to be remunerative.
The other and large participants
in the profits are the wholesale ginger-beer
manufacturers, who are also the letters-out of
fountains, one of them having generally nine
let out at a time. For a street trader to sell
three gross of ginger-beer in bottle is now
accounted a <i>good</i> week, and for that the receipts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
will be 36<i>s.</i> with a profit in the penny bottle
trade, to the seller, if he buy of a manufacturer,
of 12<i>s.</i>; if he be his own brewer&mdash;reckoning
a fair compensation for labour, and for money
invested in utensils, and in bottles, &amp;c., of 20<i>s.</i>
An ordinary week’s sale is two gross, costing
the public 24<i>s.</i>, with the same proportion of
profit in the same trade to the seller. In a <i>bad</i>
week, or “in a small way to help out other
things,” not more than one gross is sold.</p>

<p>The fountain trade is the most profitable to
the proprietors, whether they send out their
machines on their own account, or let them out
on hire; but perhaps there are only an eighth of
the number not let out on hire. Calculating
that a fountain be let out for three successive
seasons of twenty weeks each, at only 4<i>s.</i> the
week, the gross receipts are 12<i>l.</i> for what on the
first day of hire was worth only 7<i>l.</i>; so that the
returns from 200 machines let out for the same
term, would be 2,400<i>l.</i>, or a profit of 1,000<i>l.</i>
over and above the worth of the fountain, which
having been thus paid for is of course in a succeeding
year the means of a clear profit of 4<i>l.</i>
I am assured that the weekly average of “a
fountain’s takings,” when in the hands of the
regular street-dealers, is 18<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The barrel traders may be taken as in the
average receipt of 6<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>The duration of the season was, last year,
only sixteen weeks. Calculating from the best
data I could acquire, it appears that for this
period 200 street-sellers of ginger-beer in the
bottle trade of the penny class take 30<i>s.</i> a week
each (thus allowing for the inferior receipts in
bad weather); 300 take 20<i>s.</i> each, selling for
the most part at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the bottle, and that the remaining
400 “in a small way” take 6<i>s.</i> each;
hence we find 11,480<i>l.</i> expended in the bottled
ginger-beer of the streets. Adding the receipts
from the fountains and the barrels, the barrel
season continuing only ten weeks, the total sum
expended annually in street ginger-beer is altogether
14,660<i>l.</i> The bottles of ginger-beer sold
yearly in the streets will number about 4,798,000,
and the total street consumption of the same
beverage may be said to be about 250,000 gallons
per annum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience and Customers of a
Ginger-beer Seller.</span></h3>

<p>A slim, well-spoken man, with a half-military
appearance, as he had a well trimmed moustache,
and was very cleanlily dressed, gave me
the following account: “I have known the
ginger-beer trade for eight years, and every
branch of it. Indeed I think I’ve tried all
sorts of street business. I’ve been a costermonger,
a lot-seller, a nut-seller, a secret-paper-seller
(with straws, you know, sir), a
cap-seller, a street-printer, a cakeman, a clown,
an umbrella-maker, a toasting-fork maker, a
sovereign seller, and a ginger-beer seller. I
hardly know what I haven’t been. I made
my own when last I worked beer. Sunday
was my best day, or rather Sunday mornings
when there’s no public-houses open. Drinking
Saturday nights make dry Sunday mornings.
Many a time men have said to me: ‘Let’s
have a bottle to quench a spark in my throat,’
or ‘My mouth’s like an oven.’ I’ve had to
help people to lift the glass to their lips, their
hands trembled so. They couldn’t have written
their names plain if there was a sovereign for
it. But these was only chance customers; one
or two in a morning, and five or six on a
Sunday morning. I’ve been a teetotaller
myself for fifteen years. No, sir, I didn’t
turn one&mdash;but I never was a drinker&mdash;not
from any great respect for the ginger-beer trade,
but because I thought it gave one a better
chance of getting on. I once had saved money,
but it went in a long sickness. I used to be
off early on Sunday mornings sometimes to
Hackney Marsh, and sell my beer there to
gentlemen&mdash;oldish gentlemen some of them&mdash;going
a fishing. Others were going there to
swim. One week I took 35<i>s.</i> at 1<i>d.</i> a bottle, by
going out early in a morning; perhaps 20<i>s.</i> of
it was profit, but my earnings in the trade in
a good season wasn’t more than 12<i>s.</i> one week
with another. All the trades in the streets are
bad now, I think. Eight years back I could
make half as much more in ginger-beer as could
be made last summer. Working people and
boys were my other customers. I stuck to
ginger-beer in the season and then went into
something else, for I can turn my hand to anything.
I began a street life at eight years old
by selling memorandum-books in the bull-ring
at Birmingham. My parents were ill and
hadn’t a farthing in the house. I began with
1<i>d.</i> stock-money, and I bought three memorandum-books
for it at Cheap Jack’s thatched
house. I’ve been in London seventeen or
eighteen years. I’m a roulette-maker now;
I mean the roulette boxes that gentlemen take
with them to play with when travelling on a
railway or such times. I make loaded dice, too,
and supply gaming-houses. I think I know
more gaming-houses than any man in London.
I’ve sold them to gentlemen and to parsons,
that is ministers of religion. I can prove that.
I don’t sell those sort of things in the streets.
I could do very well in the trade, but it’s so
uncertain and so little’s wanted compared to
what would keep a man going, and I have a
mother that’s sixty to support. Altogether my
present business is inferior to the ginger-beer;
but the fountains will destroy all the fair ginger-beer
trade.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Hot Elder
Wine.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of hot elder wine in the streets is
one of the trades which have been long established,
but it is only within these eight or
ten years that it has been carried on in its
present form. It continues for about four months
in the winter.</p>

<p>Elder wine is made from the berries of the
elder-tree. Elder syrup&mdash;also made from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
berries&mdash;was formerly famous in the north of
England as a curative for colds, and was frequently
taken, with a small admixture of rum,
at bedtime. Some of the street-sellers make the
wine themselves; the majority, however, buy it
of the British wine makers. The berries must
be gathered when fully ripe, and on a dry day.
They are picked, measured, and put into a
copper, two gallons of water being added to
every gallon of berries. They are then boiled
till the berries are quite soft, when the liquor is
strained and pressed from them through a strong
hair sieve. The liquor thus expressed is again
put into the copper, boiled an hour, skimmed,
and placed in a tub along with a bread toast,
on which yeast is spread thickly; it then
stands two days, and is afterwards put into a
cask, a few cloves and crusted ginger being
hung in a muslin bag from the bung-hole,
so as to flavour the liquor. Sometimes this
spicing is added afterwards, when the liquor
is warmed. The berries are sold in the markets,
principally in Covent-garden,&mdash;the price
varying, according to the season, from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 3<i>s.</i> a gallon. Of all elder-wine makers the
Jews are the best as regards the street commodity.
The costermongers say they “have a
secret;” a thing said frequently enough when
superior skill is shown, and especially when,
as in the case of the Jews’ elder wine, better
pennyworths are given. The Jews, I am told,
add a small quantity of raspberry vinegar to
their “elder,” so as to give it a “sharp pleasant
twang.” The heat and pungency of the elder
wine sold in the streets is increased by some
street-sellers by means of whole black pepper
and capsicums.</p>

<p>The apparatus in which the wine is now kept
for sale in the streets is of copper or brass,
and is sometimes “handsome.” It is generally
an urn of an oblong form, erected on a sort
of pedestal, with the lid or top ornamented
with brass mouldings, &amp;c. Three plated taps
give vent to the beverage. Orifices are contrived
and are generally hidden, or partially
hidden, with some ornament, which act as
safety-valves, or, as one man would have it,
“chimneys.” The interior of these urns holds
three or four quarts of elder wine, which is surrounded
with boiling water, and the water and
wine are kept up to the boiling pitch by
means of a charcoal fire at the foot of the
vessel. Fruit of some kind is generally sold
by the elder-wine men at their stand.</p>

<p>The elder wine urn is placed on a stand
covered with an oil-cloth, six or eight glasses
being ranged about it. It is sold at a halfpenny
and a penny a glass; but there is
“little difference in some elder wines,” I
was told, “between the penn’orths and the
ha’porths.” A wine glass of the “regular”
size is a half-quartern, or the eighth of a pint.</p>

<p>Along with each glass of hot elder wine is
given a small piece of toasted bread. Some
buyers steep this bread in the wine, and so
imbibe the flavour. “It ain’t no good as I
know on,” said an elder-wine seller, “but
it’s the fashion, and so people must have
it.” The purchasers of elder wine are the
working classes&mdash;but not the better order of
them&mdash;and the boys of the street. Some of
these lads, I was told, were very choice and
critical in their elder wines. Some will say:
“It ain’t such bad wine, but not the real
spicy.”&mdash;“The helder I thinks,” said another,
“is middlin’, but somehow there’s nothing but
hotness for to taste.”</p>

<p>Of these traders there are now perhaps fifty
in London. One man counted up thirty of his
brethren whom he knew personally, or knew
to be then “working elder,” and he thought
that there might be as many more, but I am
assured that fifty is about the mark. The
sellers of elder wine have been for the most
part mechanics who have adopted the calling
for the reasons I have often given. None of
them, in the course of my inquiry, depended
entirely upon the sale of the wine, but sold fruit
in addition to it. All complained of the bad
state of trade. One man said, that four or five
years back he had replenished the wine in a
three quart urn twelve times a day, a jar of
the wine being kept at the stall in readiness for
that purpose. This amounted to 576 glasses
sold in the course of the day, and a receipt&mdash;reckoning
each glass at a penny&mdash;of 48<i>s.</i>; but
probably not more than 40<i>s.</i> would be taken,
as some would have halfpenny glasses. Now the
same man rarely sells three quarts in a day,
except perhaps on a Saturday, and on wet days
he sells none at all. The elder wine can be
bought at almost any price at the wine makers,
from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the quart. The charge in
the public-houses is twice as high as in the
streets, but the inn wine, I was told by a person
familiar with the trade, contains spirit, and is
more highly spiced.</p>

<p>A decent-looking middle-aged man who had
been in a gentleman’s service, but was disabled
by an accident which crushed his hand, and
who thereupon resorted to street-selling and
had since continued in it, in different branches,
from fifteen to twenty years, gave me an account
of his customers. He had not been acquainted
with the elder-wine trade above four or five
years when he bought an elder can for about 15<i>s.</i>
among a cheap miscellaneous “lot” in Smithfield
one Friday afternoon, and so he commenced:</p>

<p>“It’s a poor trade, sir,” he said. “I don’t
suppose any of us make 10<i>s.</i> a week at it alone,
but it’s a good help to other things, and I do
middling. I should say less than a 1<i>s.</i> a day
was above the average profits of the trade. Say
5<i>s.</i> a week, for on wet days we can’t sell at all.
No one will stop to drink elder wine in the wet.
They’ll rather have a pennor’th of gin, or half
a pint of beer with the chill off, under shelter.
I sell sometimes to people that say they’re
teetotallers and ask if there’s any spirit in my
wine. I assure them there’s not, just the juice
of the berry. I start when I think the weather’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cold enough, and keep at it as long as there’s
any demand. My customers are boys and
poor people, and I sell more ha’porths than
pennor’ths. I’ve heard poor women that’s
bought of me say it was the only wine they
ever tasted. The boys are hard to please, but
I won’t put up with their nonsense. It’s not
once in fifty times that a girl of the town buys
my wine. It’s not strong enough for her, I
fancy. A sharp frosty dry day suits me best.
I may then sell three or four quarts. I don’t
make it, but buy it. It’s a poor trade, and I
think it gets worse every year, though I believe
there’s far fewer of us.”</p>

<p>One elder-wine stand in Tottenham-court-road
cost, when new, 7<i>l.</i>, but that was six or
seven years ago. Calculating that 50 persons
clear 5<i>s.</i> a week for 16 weeks, their profit being
at least cent. per cent., the street outlay in this
very British wine will be only 200<i>l.</i>, and the
street-consumption of it in the course of the
year 1,500 gallons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Peppermint-Water.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps the only thing which can be called a
cordial or a liqueur sold in the streets (if we
except elder wine), is peppermint-water, and of
this the sale is very limited. For the first 15
or 20 years of the present century, I was told
by one who spoke from a personal knowledge,
“a pepperminter” had two little taps to his keg,
which had a division in the interior. From one
tap was extracted “peppermint-water;” from
the other, “strong peppermint-water.” The one
was at that time 1<i>d.</i> a glass, the other from 2<i>d.</i>
to 4<i>d.</i>, according to the size of the glass. With
the “strong” beverage was mixed smuggled
spirit, but so strongly impregnated with the
odour of the mint, that a passer-by could not
detect the presence of the illicit compound.
There are six persons selling peppermint-water
in the winter, and only half that number in the
summer. The trade is irregular, as some pursue
it only of a night, and generally in the street markets;
others sell at Billingsgate, and places of
great traffic, when the traffic is being carried on.
They are stationary for awhile, but keep shifting
their ground. The vendors generally “distilled
their own mint,” when the sale was greater, but
within these six or eight years they have purchased
it at a distilling chemist’s, and have
only prepared it for sale. Water is added to the
distilled liquid bought of the chemist, to increase
the quantity; but to enhance the heat of
the draught&mdash;which is a draw to some buyers&mdash;black
pepper (unground), or ginger, or, but
rarely, capsicums, are steeped in the beverage.
The peppermint-water is lauded by the vendors,
when questioned concerning it, as an excellent
stomachic; but nothing is said publicly of its
virtues, the cry being merely, “Pep-permint
water, a halfpenny a glass.”</p>

<p>The sellers will generally say that they distil
the peppermint-water themselves, but this is
not now commonly the case. The process, however,
is simple enough. The peppermint used
is gathered just as it is bursting into flower, and
the leaves and buds are placed in a tub, with
just water enough to cover them. This steeping
continues 24 hours, and then a still is filled
three-parts full, and the water is “over” drawn
very slowly.</p>

<p>The price at the chemist’s is 1<i>s.</i> a quart for
the common mint-water; the street price is &frac12;<i>d.</i>
a glass, containing something short of the eighth
of a pint. What costs 1<i>s.</i>, the street-seller disposes
of for 2<i>s.</i>, so realising the usual cent. per
cent.</p>

<p>To take 2<i>s.</i> is now accounted “a tidy day’s
work;” and calculating that four “pepperminters”
take that amount the year round, Sundays
excepted, we find that nearly 125<i>l.</i> is spent
annually in peppermint-water and 900 gallons
of it consumed every year in the streets of
London.</p>

<p>The capital required is, keg, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or jar,
2<i>s.</i> (for they are used indifferently); four glasses,
1<i>s.</i>; towel, 4<i>d.</i>, and stock-money, 4<i>s.</i>; or, in all,
about 8<i>s.</i> The “water”-keg, or jar, is carried
by the vendor, but sometimes it is rested on a
large stool carried for the purpose. A distilling
apparatus, such as the street-sellers used, was
worth about 10<i>s.</i> The vendors are of the same
class of street-sellers as the ginger-beer people.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Milk Selling in St. James’s Park.</span></h3>

<p>The principal sale of milk from the cow is in
St. James’s Park. The once fashionable drink
known as syllabubs&mdash;the milk being drawn
warm from the cow’s udder, upon a portion
of wine, sugar, spice, &amp;c.&mdash;is now unknown.
As the sellers of milk in the park are merely
the servants of cow-keepers, and attend to the
sale as a part of their business, no lengthened
notice is required.</p>

<p>The milk-sellers obtain leave from the Home
Secretary, to ply their trade in the park. There
are eight stands in the summer, and as many
cows, but in the winter there are only four cows.
The milk-vendors sell upon an average, in
the summer, from eighteen to twenty quarts
per day; in the winter, not more than a third
of that quantity. The interrupted milking of
the cows, as practised in the Park, often causes
them to give less milk, than they would in
the ordinary way. The chief customers are
infants, and adults, and others, of a delicate
constitution, who have been recommended to
take new milk. On a wet day scarcely any
milk can be disposed of. Soldiers are occasional
customers.</p>

<p>A somewhat sour-tempered old woman,
speaking as if she had been crossed in love, but
experienced in this trade, gave me the following
account:</p>

<p>“It’s not at all a lively sort of life, selling
milk from the cows, though some thinks it’s
a gay time in the Park! I’ve often been dull
enough, and could see nothing to interest one,
sitting alongside a cow. People drink new milk
for their health, and I’ve served a good many such.
They’re mostly young women, I think, that’s de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>licate,
and makes the most of it. There’s twenty
women, and more, to one man what drinks new
milk. If they was set to some good hard work,
it would do them more good than new milk, or
ass’s milk either, I think. Let them go on a milk-walk
to cure them&mdash;that’s what I say. Some
children come pretty regularly with their nurses
to drink new milk. Some bring their own china
mugs to drink it out of; nothing less was good
enough for them. I’ve seen the nurse-girls
frightened to death about the mugs. I’ve heard
one young child say to another: ‘I shall tell
mama that Caroline spoke to a mechanic, who
came and shook hands with her.’ The girl
was as red as fire, and said it was her brother.
Oh, yes, there’s a deal of brothers comes to
look for their sisters in the Park. The greatest
fools I’ve sold milk to is servant-gals out
for the day. Some must have a day, or half a
day, in the month. Their mistresses ought to
keep them at home, I say, and not let them out
to spend their money, and get into nobody knows
what company for a holiday; mistresses is too
easy that way. It’s such gals as makes fools
of themselves in liking a soldier to run after
them. I’ve seen one of them&mdash;yes, some would
call her pretty, and the prettiest is the silliest
and easiest tricked out of money, that’s my opinion,
anyhow&mdash;I’ve seen one of them, and more
than one, walk with a soldier, and they’ve stopped
a minute, and she’s taken something out of her
glove and given it to him. Then they’ve come
up to me, and he’s said to her, ‘Mayn’t I treat
you with a little new milk, my dear?’ and he’s
changed a shilling. Why, of course, the silly
fool of a gal had given him that there shilling.
I thought, when Annette Myers shot the soldier,
it would be a warning, but nothing’s a warning
to some gals. <i>She</i> was one of those fools. It
was a good deal talked about at the stand, but
I think none of us know’d her. Indeed, we
don’t know our customers but by sight. Yes,
there’s now and then some oldish gentlemen&mdash;I
suppose they’re gentlemen, anyhow, they’re
idle men&mdash;lounging about the stand: but there’s
no nonsense there. They tell me, too, that
there’s not so much lounging about as there
was; those that’s known the trade longer than
me thinks so. Them children’s a great check
on the nusses, and they can’t be such fools as
the servant-maids. I don’t know how many of
them I’ve served with milk along with soldiers:
I never counted them. They’re nothing to me.
Very few elderly people drink new milk. It’s
mostly the young. I’ve been asked by strangers
when the Duke of Wellington would pass to the
Horse-Guards or to the House of Lords. He’s
pretty regular. I’ve had 6<i>d.</i> given me&mdash;but not
above once or twice a year&mdash;to tell strangers
where was the best place to see him from as
he passed. I don’t understand about this Great
Exhibition, but, no doubt, more new milk will
be sold when it’s opened, and that’s all I cares
about.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Milk.</span></h3>

<p>During the summer months milk is sold in
Smithfield, Billingsgate, and the other markets,
and on Sundays in Battersea-fields, Clapham-common,
Camberwell-green, Hampstead-heath,
and similar places. About twenty men
are engaged in this sale. They usually wear a
smock frock, and have the cans and yoke used
by the regular milk-sellers; they are not
itinerant. The skim milk&mdash;for they sell none
else&mdash;is purchased at the dairies at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a
quart, and even the skim milk is also further
watered by the street-sellers. Their cry is
“Half-penny half-pint! Milk!” The tin
measure however in which the milk-and-water
is served is generally a “slang,” and contains
but half of the quantity proclaimed. The purchasers
are chiefly boys and children; rarely
men, and never costermongers, I was told, “for
they reckon milk sickly.” These street-sellers&mdash;who
have most of them been employed in the
more regular milk-trade&mdash;clear about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a day each, for three months; and as the profit
is rather more than cent. per cent. it appears
that about 4,000 gallons of milk are thus sold,
and upwards of 260<i>l.</i> laid out upon these persons,
yearly in its purchase.</p>

<p>A pair of cans with the yoke cost 15<i>s.</i>, and
1<i>l.</i> is amply sufficient as capital to start in this
trade, as the two measures used may be bought
for 2<i>s.</i>; and 3<i>s.</i> can be devoted to the purchase
of the liquid.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sale of Curds and
Whey.</span></h3>

<p>The preparations of milk which comprise the
street-trade, are curds and whey and rice-milk,
the oldest street-sellers stating that these were a
portion of the trade in their childhood. The one
is a summer, and the other a winter traffic, and
both are exclusively in the hands of the same
middle-aged and elderly women. The vendors
prepare the curds and whey in all cases themselves.
“Skim-milk,” purchased at the dairies,
is used by the street-purveyors, a gallon being
the quantity usually prepared at a time. This
milk gallon is double the usual quantity, or
eight quarts. The milk is first “scalded,” the
pan containing it being closely watched, in order
that the contents may not boil. The scalding occupies
10 or 15 minutes, and it is then “cooled”
until it attains the lukewarmness of new milk.
Half a pound of sugar is then dissolved in the
milk, and a tea-spoonful of rennet is introduced,
which is sufficient to “turn” a gallon. In an
hour, or in some cases two, the milk is curded,
and is ready for use. The street-sale is confined
to stalls; the stall, which is the ordinary
stand, being covered with a white cloth, or in
some cases an oil-cloth, and on this the curds,
in a bright tin kettle or pan, are deposited.
There are six mugs on the board, and a spoon in
each, but those who affect a more modern style
have glasses. One of the neatest stalls, as regards
the display of glass, and the bright cleanliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of the vessel containing the curds, is in Holborn;
but the curd-seller there has only an average
business. The mugs or glasses hold about the
third of a pint, and “the full of one” is a penny-worth;
for a halfpenny-worth the vessel is half
filled. The season is during the height of summer,
and continues three or four months, or, as
one woman tersely and commercially expressed
it, “from Easter to fruit.” The number of
street-saleswomen is about 100. Along with the
curds they generally sell oranges, or such early
fruit as cherries.</p>

<p>A woman who had sold “cruds”&mdash;as the
street-people usually call it&mdash;for eighteen years,
gave me the following account:&mdash;“Boys and
girls is my best customers for cruds, sir. Perhaps
I sell to them almost half of all I get rid of.
Very little fellows will treat girls, often bigger
than themselves, at my stall, and they have as
much chaffing and nonsense about it’s being
‘stunning good for the teeth,’ and such like, as
if they was grown-up. Some don’t much like it
at first, but they gets to like it. One boy, whose
young woman made faces at it&mdash;and it <i>was</i> a little
sour to be sure that morning&mdash;got quite vexed
and said, ‘Wot a image you’re a-making on
yourself!’ I don’t know what sort the boys are,
only that they’re the street-boys mostly. Quiet
working people are my other customers, perhaps
rather more women than men. Some has told
me they was teetotallers. Then there’s the
women of the town of the poorer sort, <i>they’re</i>
good customers,&mdash;as indeed I think they are
for most cooling drinks at times, for they seem
to me to be <i>always</i> thirsty. I never sell to dustmen
or that sort of people. Saturday is my
best day. If it’s fine and warm, I sell a gallon
then, which makes about 40 penn’orths; sometimes
it brings me 3<i>s.</i>, sometimes 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; it’s
rather more than half profits. Take it altogether,
I sell five gallons in fine dry weeks, and half
that in wet; and perhaps there’s what I call a
set down wet week for every two dry. Nobody
has a better right to pray against wet weather
than poor women like me. Ten years ago I sold
almost twice as much as I can now. There’s
so many more of us at present, I think, and
let alone that there’s more shops keeps it
too.”</p>

<p>Another old woman told me, that she used,
“when days was longest,” to be up all night,
and sell her “cruds” near Drury-lane theatre,
and often received in a few hours 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i>, from
“ladies and gentlemen out at night.” But the
men were so rackety, she said, and she’d had her
stall so often kicked over by drunken people,
and no help for it, that she gave up the night-trade,
and she believed it was hardly ever followed
now.</p>

<p>To start in the curds and whey line requires
the following capital:&mdash;Saucepan, for the scalding
and boiling, 2<i>s.</i>; stall, 5<i>s.</i>; 6 mugs, 6<i>d.</i>; or
6 glasses, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 6 spoons, 3<i>d.</i>; tin kettle on
stall, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; pail for water to rinse glasses, 1<i>s.</i>
Then for stock-money: 1 gallon skimmed milk,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; and &frac12; lb. sugar, 2<i>d.</i> In all,
14<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, reckoning the materials to be of the
better sort.</p>

<p>Of the whole number of street curd-sellers,
50 dispose of as much as my informant, or 12&frac12;
gallons in 3 weeks; the other 50 sell only half as
much. Taking the season at 3 months, we find
the consumption of curds and whey in the street
to be 2,812 double gallons (as regards the ingredient
of milk), at a cost to the purchasers of
421<i>l.</i>, half of which is the profit accruing to
the street-seller. The receipts of those having
the better description of business being 9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
weekly; those of the smaller traders being 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
There is a slight and occasional loss by the
“cruds” being kept until unsaleable, in which
case they are “fit for nothing but the hog-wash
man.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Rice-milk.</span></h3>

<p>To make rice-milk, the street-seller usually
boils four quarts, of the regular measure, of
“skim” with one pound of rice, which has been
previously boiled in water. An hour suffices
for the boiling of the milk; and the addition of
the rice, swollen by the boiling water, increases
the quantity to six quarts. No other process is
observed, except that some sweeten their rice-milk
before they offer it for sale; the majority,
however, sweeten it to the customer’s liking
when he is “served,” unless&mdash;to use the words
of one informant&mdash;“he have a werry, werry
sweet tooth indeed, sir; and that can’t be
stood.” For the sweetening of six quarts, half
a pound of sugar is used; for the “spicing,”
half an ounce of allspice, dashed over the milk
freely enough from a pepper-castor. Rice-milk
is always sold at stalls arranged for the purpose,
and is kept in a tin pan fitted upon a
charcoal brazier, so that the “drinkable” is
always hot. This apparatus generally stands
on the ground alongside the stall, and is
elevated only by the feet of the brazier. The
“rice-milk woman,”&mdash;for the street-sellers are
generally females,&mdash;dips a large breakfast-cup,
holding half a pint, into the pan, puts a tea-spoonful
of sugar into it, browns the whole with
allspice, and receives 1<i>d.</i>; a halfpennyworth is,
of course, half the quantity. The rice-milk
women are also sellers of oranges, chestnuts,
apples, or some other fruit, as well as the rice-milk;
but, sometimes, when the weather is
<i>very</i> cold and frosty, they sell rice-milk alone.
There are fifty street-sellers of rice-milk in
London. Saturday night is the best time of
sale, when it is not uncommon for a rice-milk
woman to sell six quarts; but, in a
good trade, four quarts a day for six days of
the week is an average. The purchasers are
poor people; and a fourth of the milk is sold to
boys and girls, to whom it is often a meal. “Ah,
sir,” said one woman, “you should have seen
how a poor man, last winter, swallowed a penn’orth.
He’d been a-wandering all night, he
said, and he looked it, and a gentleman gave
him 2<i>d.</i>, for he took pity on his hungry look, and
he spent 1<i>d.</i> with me, and I gave him another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cup for charity. ‘God bless the gentleman and
you!’ says he, ‘it’s saved my life; if I’d bought
a penny loaf, I’d have choked on it.’ He wasn’t
a beggar, for I never saw him before, and I’ve
never seen him again from that day to this.”
The same informant told me, that she believed
no rice-milk was bought by the women of the
town: “it didn’t suit the likes of them.”
Neither is it bought by those who are engaged
in noisome trades. If there be any of the rice-milk
left at night, and the saleswoman have
doubts of its “keeping,” it is re-boiled with
fresh rice and milk. The profit is considerable;
for the ingredients, which cost less than
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, are made into 96 pennyworths, and so
to realize 8<i>s.</i> In some of the poorer localities,
however, such as Rosemary-lane, only &frac12;<i>d.</i> the
half-pint can be obtained, and 4<i>s.</i> is then
the amount received for six quarts, instead
of 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>To start “in rice-milk” requires 13<i>s.</i> capital,
which includes a pan for boiling the milk,
2<i>s.</i>; a kettle, with brazier, for stall, 4<i>s.</i>; stall
or stand, 5<i>s.</i>; six cups, 9<i>d.</i>; for stock-money
15&frac12;<i>d.</i>, with which is bought 4 quarts of skim-milk,
9<i>d.</i>; 1 lb. of rice, 3<i>d.</i>; &frac12; lb. of sugar,
2<i>d.</i>; allspice, 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The season continues for four months; and
calculating&mdash;a calculation within the mark&mdash;that
one half of the 50 sellers have as good a
trade as my informant&mdash;24 quarts weekly&mdash;and
that, of the remaining 25, one half sell 12 quarts
each weekly, at 1<i>d.</i> the half-pint, and the other
half vend 24 quarts at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the half-pint, we find
that 320<i>l.</i> is annually spent in rice-milk and
about 3,000 gallons of it yearly consumed in
the streets of London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Water-Carriers.</span></h3>

<p>It may surprise many to learn that there are
still existing water-carriers in London, and
some of them depending upon the trade for
a livelihood; while others, the “odd men” of
the neighbourhood, carry pails of spring water
to the publicans or eating-house keepers, who
may not have servants to send to the nearest
pump for it, and who require it fresh and cool
for those who drink it at their meals. Of these
men there are, as near as I can ascertain, from
100 to 150; their charge is 1<i>d.</i> per pail. Their
earnings per day 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> Perhaps none of
them depend solely upon this labour for their
support.</p>

<p>It is otherwise at Highgate and Hampstead,
for in those places both men and women depend
entirely for their daily bread on water carrying.
At Hampstead the supply is derived from what
may be called a double well, known as “the
Conduit.” The ground is flagged, and the
water is seen at each corner of a wall built to
the surface of the ground (about eight feet) and
surmounted by an iron rail. The water is
covered over, in one corner and not in the other,
and the carrier descends a step or two, dips in
his pails and walks away with them when filled.
The water is carried by means of a “yoke,”
in the same way as we see the milk-pails
carried in every street in London. The well
and the field in which the Hampstead water is
situated are the property of the Church, and
the water is free to any one, in any quantity,
either for sale or any other purpose, “without
leave.” In droughts or frosts the supply fails,
and the carriers have sometimes to wait hours
for their “turn,” and then to bale the water
into their pails with a basin. The nearest
street to which the water is carried is half a
mile distant. Some is carried three quarters of
a mile, and some (occasionally) a mile. The
two pails full, which contain seven gallons, are
sold at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> The weight is about 70 lbs.
Seventeen years ago the price was 3<i>d.</i>; after
which it fell to 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, then to 2<i>d.</i>, and has been
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> these five or six years, while now there are
three or four carriers who even “carry” at two
pails a-penny to the nearer places. The supply
of the well (apart from drought or frost) is fifty-six
gallons an hour. The principal customers
are the laundresses; but in wet weather their
cisterns and water-tubs are filled, and the carriers,
or the major part of them, are idle. The
average earnings of the carriers are 5<i>s.</i> a week
the year through. Two of them are men of
seventy. There is a bench about midway to
Hampstead, at which these labourers rest; and
here on almost every fine day sits with them a
palsied old soldier, a pensioner of about eighty,
who regales them, almost daily, with long tales
of Vinegar Hill, and Jemmy O’Brien (the informer),
and all the terrors of the terrible times
of the Irish rebellion of 1798; for the old man
(himself an Irishman) had served through the
whole of it. This appears to be a somewhat
curious theme for constant expatiation to a band
of London water-carriers.</p>

<p>There are now twenty individuals, fourteen
men and six women, carrying at Hampstead, and
twice that number at Highgate. Some leave the
carrying when they get better work,&mdash;but three-fourths
of the number live by it entirely. The
women are the wives and widows of carriers.
The men have been either mechanics or labourers,
except six or eight youths (my informant
was not certain which) who had been “brought
up to the water, but would willingly get away
from it if they could.”</p>

<p>A well-spoken and intelligent-looking man,
dressed in thick fustian, old and greasy, “but
good enough for the carrying,” gave me the following
account.</p>

<p>“I was a copper-plate printer,” he said,
“and twenty years ago could earn my 25<i>s.</i> a
week. But employment fell off. The lithographic
injured it, and at last I could get very
little work, and then none at all, so I have been
carrying now between three and four years. My
father-in-law was in the trade, and that made
me think of it. My best day’s work, and it’s the
same with all, is 2<i>s.</i>, which is sixteen turns.
It’s not possible to do more. If that could be
done every day it would be very well, but in
wet weather when the laundresses, who are my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
customers, don’t want water, I can’t make 1<i>s.</i> a
week. Then in a drought or a frost one has to
wait such a long time for his turn, that it’s not
6<i>d.</i> a day; a dry spring’s the worst. Last
March I had many days to wait six turns, and
it takes well on to an hour for a turn then. We
sit by the well and talk when we’re waiting.
O, yes, sir, the Pope has had his turn of talk.
There’s water companies both at Hampstead
and Highgate, but our well water (Hampstead)
is asked for, for all that. It’s so with Highgate.
It is beautiful water, either for washing or
drinking. Perhaps it’s better with a little drop
of spirit for drinking, but I seldom taste it that
way. The fatigue’s so great that we <i>must</i> take
a little drop of spirit on a long day. No, sir, we
don’t mix it; that spoils two good things. I’ve
been at the well first light in the morning, and
in summer I’ve been at work at it all night.
There’s no rule among us, but it’s understood
that every one has his turn. There’s a little
chaff sometimes, and some get angry at having
to wait, but I never knew a fight. I have a wife
and three children. She works for a laundress,
and has 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day. She has two days regular
every week, and sometimes odd turns as well.
I think that the women earn more than the
men in Hampstead. My rent is 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week
for an unfurnished room. There is no trade on
Sundays, but on fine summer Sundays old &mdash;&mdash;
attends at the well and sells glasses of cool
water. He gets 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> some days. He makes
no charge; just what any one pleases to give.
Any body might do it, but the old gentleman
would grumble that they were taking his post.”</p>

<p>Computing the number of water carriers at the
two places at sixty, and their average earnings
through the year at 5<i>s.</i> a week, it appears that
these men receive 780<i>l.</i> yearly. The capital
required to start in the business is 9<i>s.</i>, the cost
of a pair of pails and a yoke.</p>

<p>The old man who sells water on the summer
Sunday mornings, generally leaving off his sale
at church-time, told me that his best customers
were ladies and gentlemen who loved an
early walk, and bought of him “as it looked
like a bit of country life,” he supposed, more
than from being thirsty. When such customers
were not inhabitants of the neighbourhood, they
came to him to ask their way, or to make
inquiries concerning the localities. Sometimes
he dispensed water to men who “looked as if
they had been on the loose all night.” “One
gentleman,” he said, “looks sharp about him,
and puts a dark-coloured stuff&mdash;very likely it’s
brandy&mdash;into the two or three glasses of water
which he drinks every Sunday, or which he used
to drink rather, for I missed him all last summer,
I think. His hand trembled like a aspen; he
mostly gave me 6<i>d.</i>” The water-seller spoke
with some indignation of boys, and sometimes
men, going to the well on a Sunday morning
and “drinking out of their own tins that they’d
taken with ’em.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Pastry And
Confectionary.</span></h3>

<p>The cooked provisions sold in the streets, it has
been before stated, consist of three kinds&mdash;solids,
liquids, and pastry and confectionary.
The two first have now been fully described,
but the last still remains to be set forth.</p>

<p>The street pastry may be best characterised as
of a <i>strong</i> flavour. This is, for the most part,
attributable to the use of old or rancid butter,&mdash;possessing
the all-important recommendation of
cheapness,&mdash;or to the substitution of lard, dripping,
or some congenial substance. The “strong”
taste, however, appears to possess its value in
the estimation of street pastry-buyers, especially
among the boys. This may arise from the
palates of the consumers having been unaccustomed
to more delicate flavours, and having
become habituated to the relish of that which
is somewhat rank; just in the same way as the
“<i>fumet</i>” of game or venison becomes dear to
the palate of the more aristocratic <i>gourmand</i>. To
some descriptions of street pastry the epithet
strong-flavoured may seem inappropriate, but
it is appropriate to the generality of these comestibles,&mdash;especially
to the tarts, which constitute a
luxury, if not to the meat pies or puddings that
may supply a meal.</p>

<p>The articles of pastry sold in the London
streets are meat and fruit pies, boiled meat
and kidney puddings, plum “duff” or pudding,
and an almost infinite variety of tarts,
cakes, buns, and biscuits; while the confectionary
consists of all the several preparations included
under the wide denomination of “sweet-stuff,”
as well as the more “medicinal” kind
known as “cough drops;” in addition to these
there are the more “aristocratic” delicacies recently
introduced into street traffic, viz., penny
raspberry creams and ices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Street Piemen.</span></h3>

<p>The itinerant trade in pies is one of the most
ancient of the street callings of London. The
meat pies are made of beef or mutton; the fish
pies of eels; the fruit of apples, currants, gooseberries,
plums, damsons, cherries, raspberries,
or rhubarb, according to the season&mdash;and occasionally
of mince-meat. A few years ago the
street pie-trade was very profitable, but it has
been almost destroyed by the “pie-shops,”
and further, the few remaining street-dealers
say “the people now haven’t the pennies to
spare.” Summer fairs and races are the best
places for the piemen. In London the best times
are during any grand sight or holiday-making,
such as a review in Hyde-park, the Lord Mayor’s
show, the opening of Parliament, Greenwich
fair, &amp;c. Nearly all the men of this class, whom
I saw, were fond of speculating as to whether
the Great Exposition would be “any good” to
them, or not.</p>

<p>The London piemen, who may number about
forty in winter, and twice that number in summer,
are seldom stationary. They go along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their pie-cans on their arms, crying, “Pies all
’ot! eel, beef, or mutton pies! Penny pies,
all ’ot&mdash;all ’ot!” The “can” has been
before described. The pies are kept hot by
means of a charcoal fire beneath, and there
is a partition in the body of the can to separate
the hot and cold pies. The “can” has
two tin drawers, one at the bottom, where the hot
pies are kept, and above these are the cold pies.
As fast as the hot dainties are sold, their place
is supplied by the cold from the upper drawer.</p>

<p>A teetotal pieman in Billingsgate has a pony
and “shay cart.” His business is the most extensive
in London. It is believed that he sells
20<i>s.</i> worth or 240 pies a day, but his brother
tradesmen sell no such amount. “I was out
last night,” said one man to me, “from four in
the afternoon till half-past twelve. I went
from Somers-town to the Horse Guards, and
looked in at all the public-houses on my way,
and I didn’t take above 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I have been
out sometimes from the beginning of the evening
till long past midnight, and haven’t taken
more than 4<i>d.</i>, and out of that I have to pay 1<i>d.</i>
for charcoal.”</p>

<p>The pie-dealers usually make the pies themselves.
The meat is bought in “pieces,” of the
same part as the sausage-makers purchase&mdash;the
“stickings”&mdash;at about 3<i>d.</i> the pound.
“People, when I go into houses,” said one
man, “often begin crying, ‘Mee-yow,’ or ‘Bow-wow-wow!’
at me; but there’s nothing of
that kind now. Meat, you see, is so cheap.”
About five-dozen pies are generally made at a
time. These require a quartern of flour at 5<i>d.</i>
or 6<i>d.</i>; 2 lbs. of suet at 6<i>d.</i>; 1&frac12; lb. meat at 3<i>d.</i>,
amounting in all to about 2<i>s.</i> To this must be
added 3<i>d.</i> for baking; 1<i>d.</i> for the cost of keeping
hot, and 2<i>d.</i> for pepper, salt, and eggs with
which to season and wash them over. Hence the
cost of the five dozen would be about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and
the profit the same. The usual quantity of meat
in each pie is about half an ounce. There are
not more than 20 <i>hot</i>-piemen now in London.
There are some who carry pies about on a tray
slung before them; these are mostly boys, and,
including them, the number amounts to about
sixty all the year round, as I have stated.</p>

<p>The penny pie-shops, the street men say, have
done their trade a great deal of harm. These shops
have now got mostly all the custom, as they make
the pies much larger for the money than those
sold in the streets. The pies in Tottenham-court-road
are very highly seasoned. “I
bought one there the other day, and it nearly
took the skin off my mouth; it was full of
pepper,” said a street-pieman, with considerable
bitterness, to me. The reason why so
large a quantity of pepper is put in is, because
persons can’t exactly tell the flavour of the
meat with it. Piemen generally are not very
particular about the flavour of the meat they
buy, as they can season it up into anything.
In the summer, a street pieman thinks he is
doing a good business if he takes 5<i>s.</i> per day,
and in the winter if he gets half that. On a
Saturday night, however, he generally takes 5<i>s.</i>
in the winter, and about 8<i>s.</i> in the summer.
At Greenwich fair he will take about 14<i>s.</i> At
a review in Hyde-park, if it is a good one,
he will sell about 10<i>s.</i> worth. The generality
of the customers are the boys of London. The
women seldom, if ever, buy pies in the streets.
At the public-houses a few pies are sold, and
the pieman makes a practice of “looking in”
at all the taverns on his way. Here his customers
are found principally in the tap-room.
“Here’s all ’ot!” the pieman cries, as he
walks in; “toss or buy! up and win ’em!”
This is the only way that the pies can be got
rid of. “If it wasn’t for tossing we shouldn’t
sell one.”</p>

<p>To “toss the pieman” is a favourite pastime
with costermongers boys and all that class;
some of whom aspire to the repute of being
gourmands, and are critical on the quality of
the comestible. If the pieman win the toss,
he receives 1<i>d.</i> without giving a pie; if he lose,
he hands it over for nothing. The pieman
himself never “tosses,” but always calls head
or tail to his customer. At the week’s end it
comes to the same thing, they say, whether
they toss or not, or rather whether they win
or lose the toss: “I’ve taken as much as
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at tossing, which I shouldn’t have had if
I had’nt done so. Very few people buy without
tossing, and the boys in particular. Gentlemen
‘out on the spree’ at the late public-houses will
frequently toss when they don’t want the pies, and
when they win they will amuse themselves by
throwing the pies at one another, or at me.
Sometimes I have taken as much as half-a-crown,
and the people of whom I had the
money has never eaten a pie. The boys has
the greatest love of gambling, and they seldom,
if ever, buys without tossing.” One of the
reasons why the street boys delight in tossing,
is, that they can often obtain a pie by such
means when they have only a halfpenny wherewith
to gamble. If the lad wins he gets a
penny pie for his halfpenny.</p>

<p>For street mince-meat pies the pieman usually
makes 5lb. of mince-meat at a time, and for this
he will put in 2 doz. of apples, 1lb. of sugar,
1lb. of currants, 2lb. of “critlings” (critlings
being the refuse left after boiling down the
lard), a good bit of spice to give the critlings
a flavour, and plenty of treacle to make the
mince-meat look rich.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>The “gravy” which used to be given with
the meat-pies was poured out of an oil-can,
and consisted of a little salt and water browned.
A hole was made with the little finger in the
top of the meat pie, and the “gravy” poured
in until the crust rose. With this gravy a person
in the line assured me that he has known
pies four days old to go off very freely, and be
pronounced excellent. The street piemen are
mostly bakers, who are unable to obtain employment
at their trade. “I myself,” said one,
“was a bread and biscuit baker. I have been
at the pie business now about two years and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
half, and I can’t get a living at it. Last week
my earnings were not more than 7<i>s.</i> all the
week through, and I was out till three in the
morning to get that.” The piemen seldom
begin business till six o’clock, and some remain
out all night. The best time for the sale
of pies is generally from ten at night to one in
the morning.</p>

<p>Calculating that there are only fifty street
piemen plying their trade in London, the year
through, and that their average earnings are
8<i>s.</i> a week, we find a street expenditure exceeding
1,040<i>l.</i>, and a street consumption of
pies amounting nearly to three quarters of
a million yearly.</p>

<p>To start in the penny pie business of the
streets requires 1<i>l.</i> for a “can,” 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a
“turn-halfpenny” board to gamble with, 12<i>s.</i>
for a gross of tin pie-dishes, 8<i>d.</i> for an apron,
and about 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for stock money&mdash;allowing
1<i>s.</i> for flour, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for meat, 2<i>d.</i> for apples,
4<i>d.</i> for eels, 2<i>s.</i> for pork flare or fat, 2<i>d.</i> for
sugar, &frac12;<i>d.</i> for cloves, 1<i>d.</i> for pepper and salt,
1<i>d.</i> for an egg to wash the pies over with,
6<i>d.</i> for baking, and 1<i>d.</i> for charcoal to keep
the pies hot in the streets. Hence the capital
required would be about 2<i>l.</i> in all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Boiled
Puddings.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of <i>boiled</i> puddings, meat and currant&mdash;which
might perhaps be with greater correctness
called dumplings&mdash;has not been known
in London, I was informed by one in the trade,
more than twelve or fourteen years. The
ingredients for the meat puddings are not
dissimilar to those I have described as required
for the meat pies, but the puddings are
boiled, in cotton bags, in coppers or large pans,
and present the form of a round ball. The
charge is a halfpenny each. Five or six years
back a man embarked his means&mdash;said to be
about 15<i>l.</i>&mdash;in the meat-pudding line, and prepared
a superior article, which was kept warm
in the street by means of steam, in a manner
similar to that employed by the pieman. A
mechanic out of work was engaged by this
projector to aid him in the sale of his street
luxuries, and the mechanic and his two boys
made a living by this sale for two or three years.
The original pudding-projector relinquished the
street trade to go into business as a small shop-keeper,
and the man who sold for him on a sort
of commission, earning from 12<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> a week,
made the puddings on his own account. His
earnings, however, on his own account were not
above from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week beyond what he
earned by commission, and a little while back
he obtained work again at his own business, but
his two boys still sell puddings in the street.</p>

<p>The sale of boiled meat puddings is carried
on only in the autumn and winter months, and
only in the evenings, except on Saturdays, when
the business commences in the afternoon. The
sale, I was informed by one of the parties, has
been as many as forty-five dozen puddings on
a Saturday evening. The tins in which the
puddings are carried about hold from four to
six dozen, and are replenished from the pans&mdash;the
makers always living contiguous to the
street where the vend takes place&mdash;as fast as
the demand requires such replenishment. An
average sale on a fine dry winter Saturday evening
is thirty dozen, but then, as in most street
callings, “the weather”&mdash;a remark often made
to me&mdash;“has considerable to do with it.” A
frost, I was told, helped off the puddings, and
a rain kept them back. Next to Saturday the
best business night is Monday; but the average
sale on the Monday is barely half that on the
Saturday, and on the other evenings of the week
about a third. This gives a weekly sale by each
street-seller of 85 dozen, or 1,020 puddings,
and as I am informed there are now but six
street-sellers (regularly) of this comestible, the
weekly aggregate would be&mdash;allowing for bad
weather&mdash;5,400, or 129,600 in a season of
24 weeks; an expenditure on the part of the
street boys and girls (who are the principal
purchasers), and of the poor persons who
patronise the street-trade, of about 270<i>l.</i> per
annum. The wandering street-musicians of
the poorer class&mdash;such as “Old Sarey” and
the Italian boys&mdash;often make their dinner off a
meat pudding purchased on their rounds; for it
is the rule with such people never to return home
after starting in the morning till their day’s
work is done.</p>

<p>The boys who ply their callings in the street,
or are much in the open air, are very fond of
these puddings, and to witness the way in which
they throw the pudding, when very hot, from
hand to hand, eyeing it with an expression that
shows an eagerness to eat with a fear of burning
the mouth, is sometimes laughable and sometimes
painful, because not unfrequently there
is a look of keen hunger about the&mdash;probably
outcast&mdash;lad. The currant puddings are, I
believe, sold only at Billingsgate and Petticoat-lane.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Plum “Duff”
or Dough.</span></h3>

<p>Plum dough is one of the street-eatables&mdash;though
perhaps it is rather a violence to class
it with the street-pastry&mdash;which is usually
made by the vendors. It is simply a boiled
plum, or currant, pudding, of the plainest
description. It is sometimes made in the
rounded form of the plum-pudding; but more
frequently in the “roly-poly” style. Hot pudding
used to be of much more extensive sale in
the streets. One informant told me that twenty
or thirty years ago, batter, or Yorkshire, pudding,
“with plums in it,” was a popular street
business. The “plums,” as in the orthodox
plum-puddings, are raisins. The street-vendors
of plum “duff” are now very few, only six as
an average, and generally women, or if a man be
the salesman he is the woman’s husband. The
sale is for the most part an evening sale, and
some vend the plum dough only on a Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
night. A woman in Leather-lane, whose trade
is a Saturday night trade, is accounted “one of
the best plum duffs” in London, as regards the
quality of the comestible, but her trade is not
considerable.</p>

<p>The vendors of plum dough are the street-sellers
who live by vending other articles, and
resort to plum dough, as well as to other things,
“as a help.” This dough is sold out of baskets
in which it is kept hot by being covered with
cloths, sometimes two and even three, thick;
and the smoke issuing out of the basket, and the
cry of the street-seller, “Hot plum duff, hot
plum,” invite custom. A quartern of flour, 5<i>d.</i>;
&frac12; lb. Valentia raisins, 2<i>d.</i>; dripping and suet in
equal proportions, 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>; treacle, &frac12;<i>d.</i>; and allspice,
&frac12;<i>d.</i>&mdash;in all 10&frac12;<i>d.</i>; supply a roly-poly of
twenty pennyworths. The treacle, however, is
only introduced “to make the dough look rich
and spicy,” and must be used sparingly.</p>

<p>The plum dough is sold in slices at &frac12;<i>d.</i> or
1<i>d.</i> each, and the purchasers are almost exclusively
boys and girls&mdash;boys being at least three-fourths
of the revellers in this street luxury.
I have ascertained&mdash;as far as the information of
the street-sellers enables me to ascertain&mdash;that
take the year through, six “plum duffers” take
1<i>s.</i> a day each, for four winter months, including
Sundays, when the trade is likewise prosecuted.
Some will take from 4<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> (but rarely 10<i>s.</i>)
on a Saturday night, and nothing on other
nights, and some do a little in the summer. The
vendors, who are all stationary, stand chiefly in
the street-markets and reside near their stands,
so that they can get relays of hot dough.</p>

<p>If we calculate then 42<i>s.</i> a week as the takings
of six persons, for five months, so including the
summer trade, we find that upwards of 200<i>l.</i>
is expended in the street purchase of plum
dough, nearly half of which is profit. The trade,
however, is reckoned among those which will
disappear altogether from the streets.</p>

<p>The capital required to start is: basket,
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; cloths, 6<i>d.</i>; pan for boiling, 2<i>s.</i>; knife,
2<i>d.</i>; stock-money, 2<i>s.</i>; in all about, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Cakes,
Tarts, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>These men and boys&mdash;for there are very few
women or girls in the trade&mdash;constitute a somewhat
numerous class. They are computed (including
Jews) at 150 at the least, all regular
hands, with an addition, perhaps, of 15 or 20,
who seek to earn a few pence on a Sunday,
but have some other, though poorly remunerative,
employment on the week-days. The
cake and tart-sellers in the streets have been,
for the most part, mechanics or servants; a fifth
of the body, however, have been brought up to
this or to some other street-calling.</p>

<p>The cake-men carry their goods on a tray slung
round their shoulders when they are offering
their delicacies for sale, and on their heads when
not engaged in the effort to do business. They
are to be found in the vicinity of all public
places. Their goods are generally arranged in
pairs on the trays; in bad weather they are
covered with a green cloth.</p>

<p>None of the street-vendors make the articles
they sell; indeed, the diversity of those articles
renders that impossible. Among the regular
articles of this street-sale are “Coventrys,” or
three-cornered puffs with jam inside; raspberry
biscuits; cinnamon biscuits; “chonkeys,” or a
kind of mince-meat baked in crust; Dutch
butter-cakes; Jews’ butter-cakes; “bowlas,”
or round tarts made of sugar, apple, and bread;
“jumbles,” or thin crisp cakes made of treacle,
butter, and flour; and jams, or open tarts with
a little preserve in the centre.</p>

<p>All these things are made for the street-sellers
by about a dozen Jew pastry-cooks, the most of
whom reside about Whitechapel. They confine
themselves to the trade, and make every description.
On a fine holiday morning their shops, or
rather bake-houses, are filled with customers,
as they supply the small shops as well as the
street-sellers of London. Each article is made
to be sold at a halfpenny, and the allowance by
the wholesale pastry-cook is such as to enable
his customers to realise a profit of 4<i>d.</i> in 1<i>s.</i>;
thus he charges 4<i>d.</i> a dozen for the several
articles. Within the last seven years there has
been, I am assured, a great improvement in the
composition of these cakes, &amp;c. This is attributable
to the Jews having introduced superior
dainties, and, of course, rendered it necessary for
the others to vie with them: the articles vended
by these Jews (of whom there are from 20 to 40
in the streets) are still pronounced, by many
connoisseurs in street-pastry, as the best. Some
sell penny dainties also, but not to a twentieth
part of the halfpenny trade. One of the wholesale
pastry-cooks takes 40<i>l.</i> a week. These
wholesale men, who sometimes credit the street-people,
buy ten, fifteen, or twenty sacks of flour
at a time whenever a cheap bargain offers. They
purchase as largely in Irish butter, which they
have bought at 3<i>d.</i> or 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> the pound. They
buy also “scrapings,” or what remains in the
butter-firkins when emptied by the butter-sellers
in the shops. “Good scrapings” are used for
the best cakes; the jam they make themselves.
To commence the wholesale business requires a
capital of 600<i>l.</i> To commence the street-selling
requires a capital of only 10<i>s.</i>; and this includes
the cost of a tray, about 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; a cloth
1<i>s.</i>; and a leathern strap, with buckle, to go
round the neck, 6<i>d.</i>; while the rest is for stock,
with a shilling, or two as a reserve. All the
street-sellers insist upon the impossibility of
any general baker making cakes as cheap as
those they vend. “It’s impossible, sir,” said
one man to me; “it’s a trade by itself; nobody
else can touch it. They was miserable little
things seven years ago.”</p>

<p>An acute-looking man, decently dressed, gave
me the following account. He resided with his
wife&mdash;who went out charing&mdash;in a decent little
back-room at the East-end, for which he paid
1<i>s.</i> a week. He had no <span class="lock">children:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’m a ‘translator’ (a species of cobbler) by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
trade,” he said, “but I’ve been a cake and a
tart-seller in the streets for seven or eight years.
I couldn’t make 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a day of twelve hours’
work, and sometimes nothing, by translating.
Besides, my health was failing; and, as I used
to go out on a Sunday with cakes to sell for a
cousin of mine, I went into the trade myself,
because I’d got up to it. I did middling the
first three or four years, and I’d do middling
still, if it wasn’t for the bad weather and
the police. I’ve been up three times for
‘obstructing.’ Why, sir, I never obstructed a
quarter as much as the print-shops and newspaper-shops
down there” (pointing to a narrow
street in the City). “But the keepers of them
shops can take a sight at the Lord Mayor
from behind their tills. The first time I was
up before the Lord Mayor&mdash;it’s a few years
back&mdash;I thought he talked like an old wife.
‘You mustn’t stand that way,’ he says, ‘and you
mustn’t do this, and you mustn’t do that.’
‘Well, my lord,’ says I, ‘then I mustn’t live
honestly. But if you’ll give me 9<i>s.</i> a week, I’ll
promise not to stand here, and not to stand there;
and neither to do this, nor that, nor anything at
all, if that pleases you better.’ They was
shocked, they said, at my impudence&mdash;so young
a fellow, too! I got off each time, but a
deal of my things was spoiled. I work the City
on week-days, and Victoria Park on Sundays.
In the City, my best customers is not children,
but young gents; real gents, some of them with
gold watches. They buys twopenn’orth, mostly&mdash;that’s
four of any sort, or different sorts.
They’re clerks in banks and counting-houses, I
suppose, that must look respectable like on a
little, and so feeds cheap, poor chaps! for they
dine or lunch off it, never doubt. Or they
may be keeping their money for other things.
To sell eleven dozen is a first-rate days’ work;
that’s 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> profit. But then comes
the wet days, and I can’t trade at all in the
rain; and so the things get stale, and I have to
sell them in Petticoat-lane for two a halfpenny.
Victoria Park&mdash;I’m not let inside with my tray&mdash;is
good and bad as happens. It’s chiefly a
tossing trade there. Oh, I dare say I toss
100 times some Sundays. I don’t like tossing
the coster lads, they’re the wide-awakes that
way. The thieves use ‘grays.’ They’re ha’pennies,
either both sides heads or both tails.
Grays sell at from 2<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> I’m not often
had that way, though. Working-people buy
very few of me on Sundays; it’s mostly boys;
and next to the gents., why, perhaps, the boys
is my best customers in the City. Only on
Monday a lad, that had been lucky ‘fiddling’”
(holding horses, or picking up money anyhow)
“spent a whole shilling on me. I clear, I think&mdash;and
I’m among the cakes that’s the top
of the tree&mdash;about 10<i>s.</i> a week in summer,
and hardly 7<i>s.</i> a week in winter. My old
woman and me makes both ends meet, and
that’s all.”</p>

<p>Reckoning 150 cake-sellers, each clearing 6<i>s.</i>
a week, a sufficiently low average, the street
outlay will be 2,340<i>l.</i>, representing a street-consumption
of 1,123,200 cakes, tarts, &amp;c.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of other Cake-sellers in the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The street cake-selling of London is not <i>altogether</i>
confined to the class I have described;
but the others engaged in it are not regular
pursuers of the business, and do not exceed
thirty in number. Some stock their trays with
flare-cakes, which are round cakes, made of
flour and “unrendered” (unmelted) lard, and
stuck over freely with currants. They are sold
at a farthing and a halfpenny each. Others,
again, carry only sponge-cakes, made of flour
and eggs, packed closely and regularly together,
so as to present an uniform and inviting
surface. Others carry only gingerbread, made
of flour and treacle. These small trades are
sometimes resorted to for a temporary purpose,
rather than a street-seller’s remaining in compulsory
idleness. I learned also that cake-sellers
in the regular line, when unable to
command sufficient capital to carry on their
trade in the way they have been accustomed to,
sell “flayers,” so called from being made with
pig’s or sheep’s “flay,” or any other cheap
cakes, and so endeavour to retrieve themselves.
The profits on these plainer sorts is 1<i>d.</i> in 1<i>s.</i>
more than that on the others, but the sale
rarely exceeds half as much. I heard, however,
of one man who deposited in pence, in
eight days, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> with a wholesale pastry-cook.
He had saved this sum by almost
starving himself, on the sale of the inferior
cakes, and the dealer trusted him the 10<i>d.</i>
to make up eight dozen in the regular cake
business. To commence the street sale of
cheap cakes requires a capital of less than 5<i>s.</i>;
for tray, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; cloth, 6<i>d.</i>; strap, 6<i>d.</i>; and
stock-money, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Three or four men are occupied in selling
plum-cakes. These are generally sold in half-penny
and penny lots. The plum-cake is made
by the same class of pastrycooks whom I have
described as supplying the tarts, puffs, &amp;c., and
sold on the same terms. The profits are fifty
per cent.&mdash;what cost 4<i>s.</i> bringing in 6<i>s.</i> One
man who travels to all the fairs and races, and
is more in the country than town in the summer
and autumn, sells large quantities of plum-cake
in Smithfield when in town, sometimes having
2<i>l.</i> worth and more on his stall. He sells cakes
of a pound (ostensibly) at 4<i>d.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>, and 8<i>d.</i>,
according to quality. He sometimes supplies
the street-sellers on the same terms as the
pastrycooks, for he was once a baker.</p>

<p>From the best data at my command, it appears
that the sale of these inferior cakes does not
realise above a fifth of that taken by the other
sellers, of whom I have treated, amounting to
about 450<i>l.</i> in all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Gingerbread-nuts,
&amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of gingerbread, as I have previously
observed, was much more extensive in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
streets than it is at present. Indeed, what was
formerly known in the trade as “toy” gingerbread
is now unseen in the streets, except occasionally,
and that only when the whole has not
been sold at the neighbouring fairs, at which it
is still offered. But, even at these fairs, the
principal, and sometimes the only, toy gingerbread
that is vended is the “cock in breeches;”
a formidable-looking bird, with his nether garments
of gold. Twenty or thirty years ago,
“king George on horseback” was popular in
gingerbread. His Majesty, wearing a gilt
crown, gilt spurs, and a gilt sword, bestrode the
gilt saddle of his steed, and was eaten with
great relish by his juvenile subjects. There
were also sheep, and dogs, and other animals,
all adorned in a similar manner, and looking as
if they had been formed in close and faithful
imitation of children’s first attempts at cattle
drawing. These edible toys were then sold in
“white,” as well as in “brown” gingerbread,
the white being the same in all other respects
as the brown, except that a portion of sugar was
used in its composition instead of treacle.</p>

<p>There are now only two men in London who
make their own gingerbread-nuts for sale in
the streets. This preparation of gingerbread is
called by the street-sellers, after a common
elliptical fashion, merely “nuts.” From the
most experienced man in the street trade I had
the following account: he was an intelligent,
well-mannered, and well-spoken man, and when
he laughed or smiled, had what may be best
described as a pleasant look. After he had
initiated me into the art and mystery of gingerbread
making&mdash;which I shall detail separately&mdash;he
said,</p>

<p>“I’ve been in the ‘nut’ trade 25 years, or
thereabouts, and have made my own nuts for
20 years of that time. I bought of a gingerbread
baker at first&mdash;there was plenty of them
in them days&mdash;and the profit a living profit,
too. Certainly it was, for what I bought for 5<i>s.</i>
I could sell for 16<i>s.</i> I was brought up a baker,
but the moment I was out of my time I started
in the street nut trade for myself. I knew the
profits of it, and thought it better than the
slavery of a journeyman baker’s life. You’ve
mentioned, sir, in your work, a musical sort of
a street-crier of gingerbread (see p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>), and I
think, and indeed I’m pretty certain, that it’s
the same man as was my partner 20 years back;
aye, more than 20, but I can’t tell about years.”
[The reader will have remarked how frequently
this oblivion as to dates and periods characterises
the statements of street-sellers. Perhaps no
men take less note of time.] “At that time he
was my partner in the pig trade. Dairy-fed,
d’you say, sir? Not in the slightest. The
outsides of the hanimals was paste, and the
insides on ’em was all mince-meat. Their
eyes was currants. We two was the original
pigs, and, I believe, the only two pigs in the
streets. We often made 15<i>s.</i> between us, in a
day, in pigs alone. The musical man, as you
call him&mdash;poor fellow, he dropped down dead in
the street one day as he was crying; he was
regular worn out&mdash;cried himself into his grave
you <i>may</i> say&mdash;poor fellow, he used to sing out</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘Here’s a long-tailed pig, and a short-tailed pig,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And a pig with a curly tail:</div>
       <div class="verse">Here’s a Yorkshire pig, and a Hampshire pig,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And a pig without e’er a tail.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“When I was first in the trade, I sold twice
as many nuts as I do now, though my nuts was
only 12 a penny then, and they’re now 40. A
little larger the 12 were, but not very much. I
have taken 20<i>s.</i> and 24<i>s.</i> many and many a
Saturday. I then made from 2<i>l.</i> to 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a
week by sticking to it, and money might have
been saved. I’ve taken between 7<i>l.</i> and 8<i>l.</i> at a
Greenwich Fair in the three days, in them times,
by myself. Indeed, last Easter, my wife and
me&mdash;for she works as well as I do, and sells
almost as much&mdash;took 5<i>l.</i> But gingerbread was
money in the old times, and I sold ‘lumps’ as
well as ‘nuts;’ but now lumps won’t go off&mdash;not
in a fair, no how. I’ve been in the trade
ever since I started in it, but I’ve had turns at
other things. I was in the service of a Custom-house
agency firm; but they got into bother
about contrabands, and the revenue, and cut off
to America&mdash;I believe they took money with
them, a good bit of it&mdash;and I was indicted, or
whatever they call it, in the Court of Exchequer&mdash;I
never was in the Court in my life&mdash;and
was called upon, one fine day, to pay to the
Crown 1,580<i>l.</i>, and some odd pounds and shillings
besides! I never understood the rights of
it, but it was about smuggling. I was indicted
by myself, I believe. When Mr. Candy, and
other great houses in the City, were found
out that way, <i>they</i> made it all right; paid something,
as I’ve heard, and sacked the profits.
Well; when <i>I</i> was called on, it wasn’t, I assure
you, sir&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;at all convenient for a
servant&mdash;and I was only that&mdash;to pay the fifteen
hundred and odd; so I served 12 months and 2
days in prison for it. I’d saved a little money,
and wasn’t so uncomfortable in prison. I could
get a dinner, and give a dinner. When I came
out, I took to the nuts. It was lucky for me
that I had a trade to turn to; for, even if I
could have shown I wasn’t at all to blame about
the Exchequer, I could never have got another
situation&mdash;never. So the streets saved me: my
nuts was my bread.</p>

<p>“At this present time, sir, if I make, the year
through, 9<i>s.</i> a week, and my wife 1<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> less,
that’s the extent. When the Queen opened
Parliament, the two on us took 10<i>s.</i> The Queen’s
good for that, anyhow, in person. If the opening
was by proclamation” [so he called it, three or
four times], “it wouldn’t have been worth while
going to&mdash;not at all. If there’s not a crowd,
the police interfere, and ‘move on!’ is the order.
The Queen’s popular with me, for her opening
Parliament herself. I count it her duty. The
police are a great trouble. I can’t say they
disturb me in the place (never mind mentioning
it, sir) where you’ve seen me, but they do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
other places. They say there’s no rest for the
wicked; but, in the streets, there’s no rest for a
man trying to make an honest living, as I’m sure
I do. I could pitch anywhere, one time.</p>

<p>“My chief dependence is on working-men,
who buys my nuts to take home to their young
’uns. I never sell for parties, or desserts, that
I know of. I take very little from boys&mdash;very
little. The women of the town buy hardly any
of me. I used to sell a good many pigs to them,
in some of the streets about Brunswick-square;
kept misses, and such like&mdash;and very pleasant
customers they was, and good pay: but that’s
all over now. <i>They</i> never ’bated me&mdash;never.”</p>

<p>To make about 56 lbs. of the gingerbread-nuts
sold by my informant, takes 28 lbs. of treacle,
7<i>s.</i>; 48 lbs. of flour, 14<i>s.</i>; &frac12; lb. of ginger, 4<i>d.</i>;
and &frac12; lb. of allspice, 4<i>d.</i> From 18 to 20
dozen of small nuts go to the pound. This
quantity, at 40 a penny, reckoning 18 dozen to
a pound, realises about 5<i>d.</i> per pound; or about
25<i>s.</i> for an outlay of 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> The expense of
baking, however, and of “appurtenances,” reduces
the profit to little more than cent. per
cent.</p>

<p>The other nut-sellers in the streets vend the
“almond nuts.” Of these vendors there are
not less than 150; of them, 100 buy their goods
of the bakers (what they sell for 1<i>s.</i> costing them
4<i>d.</i>), and the other 50 make their own. The
materials are the same as those of the gingerbread,
with the addition of 4 lbs. of butter, 8<i>d.</i>
per lb.; 1 lb. of almonds, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; and 2 lbs. of
volatile salts, 8<i>d.</i> Out of this material, 60 lbs.
of “almond nuts” may be made. A split
almond is placed in the centre of each of these
nuts; and, as they are three times as large as
the gingerbread nuts, 12 a penny is the price.
To sell 36 dozen a day&mdash;and so clearing 2<i>s.</i>&mdash;is
accounted a “very tidy day’s work.” With the
drawback of wet weather, the average weekly
earnings of the almond nut-sellers are, perhaps,
the same as the gingerbread nut man’s&mdash;9<i>s.</i>
weekly. These almond nut-sellers are, for the
most part, itinerant, their localities of sale being
the same as in the “cake and tart” line. They
carry their goods, neatly done up in paper, on
trays slung from the shoulder. The gingerbread-nuts
are carried in a large basket, and are ready
packed in paper bags.</p>

<p>Some of the “almond” men call at the public-houses,
but the sale in such places is very
small. Most of those who make their own nuts
have been brought up as bakers&mdash;a class of
workmen who seem to resort and adapt themselves
to a street trade more readily than others.
The nuts are baked in the usual way, spread on
tin trays. To erect a proper oven for the purpose
costs about 5<i>l.</i>, but most of the men hire
the use of one.</p>

<p>I have already specified the materials required
to make 56 lb. of gingerbread nuts, the cost
being 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> To that, the capital required to
start in the business must be added, and this
consists of basket, 6<i>s.</i>; baize cloth, 1<i>s.</i>; pan for
dough, 1<i>s.</i>; rolling-pin, 3<i>d.</i>, and baking-tins, 1<i>s.</i>
In all about 21<i>s.</i> To begin in a small way in
the “almond” line, buying the nuts ready made,
requires as capital: tray, 2<i>s.</i>; leather strap, 6<i>d.</i>;
baize, 1<i>s.</i>; stock-money, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;in all 5<i>s.</i> The
sale is prosecuted through the year, but hot
weather is unfavourable to it, as the nuts then
turn soft.</p>

<p>Calculating that 150 of these street-dealers
take 17<i>s.</i> each weekly (clearing 9<i>s.</i>), we find
6,630<i>l.</i> spent yearly in “spice” nuts in the
streets of London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Hot-Cross
Buns, and of Chelsea Buns.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps no cry&mdash;though it is only for one
morning&mdash;is more familiar to the ears of a
Londoner, than that of “One-a-penny, two-a-penny,
hot-cross buns,” on Good Friday. The
sale is unknown in the Irish capital; for among
Roman Catholics, Good Friday, I need hardly
say, is a strict fast, and the eggs in the buns
prevent their being used. One London gentleman,
who spoke of fifty years ago, told me
that the street-bun-sellers used to have a not
unpleasing distich. On reflection, however,
my informant could not be certain whether he
had heard this distich cried, or had remembered
hearing the elders of his family speak of
it as having been cried, or how it was impressed
upon his memory. It seems hardly in accordance
with the usual style of street <span class="lock">poetry:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“One-a-penny, two-a-penny, hot-cross buns!</div>
       <div class="verse">If your daughters will not eat them, give them to your sons.</div>
       <div class="verse">But if you hav’n’t any of those pretty little elves,</div>
       <div class="verse">You cannot then do better than eat them all yourselves.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A tradesman who had resided more than
fifty years in the Borough had, in his boyhood,
heard, but not often, this ridiculous <span class="lock">cry:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“One-a-penny, poker; two-a-penny, tongs!</div>
       <div class="verse">One-a-penny; two-a-penny, hot-cross buns.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sellers of the Good Friday buns are
principally boys, and they are of mixed classes&mdash;costers’
boys, boys habitually and boys occasionally
street-sellers, and boys street-sellers for
that occasion only. One great inducement to
embark in the trade is the hope of raising a
little money for the Greenwich Fair of the following
Monday.</p>

<p>I am informed that 500 persons are employed
on Good Friday in the streets of London in the
sale of hot-cross buns, each itinerant selling
upon the day’s average six dozen halfpenny,
and seven dozen penny buns, for which he will
take 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (his profits being 3<i>d.</i> in the shilling
or 3<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>). One person informed me that last
Good Friday he had sold during the day forty
dozen penny buns, for which he received 50<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The bun-selling itinerants derive their supplies
principally from the wholesale pastry-cooks,
and, in a less degree, from the small
bakers and pastrycooks, who work more for
“the trade” than themselves. The street hot-cross
bun trade is less than it was seven or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
years ago, as the bakers have entered into it
more freely, and send round for orders: so that
the itinerants complain that they have lost many
a good customer. One informant (a master pastry-cook,
who had been in the business nearly fifty
years) said to me: “Times are sadly altered to
what they were when I was a boy. Why I have
known my master to bake five sacks of flour in
nothing but hot-cross buns, and that is sufficient
for 20,000 buns” (one sack of flour being used
for 4,000 buns, or 500 lbs. of raw material to
the same quantity of buns). The itinerants
carry their baskets slung on their arm, or borne
upon the head. A flannel or green baize is
placed at the bottom of the basket and brought
over the buns, after which a white cloth is spread
over the top of the baize, to give it a clean appearance.</p>

<p>A vendor of “hot-cross buns” has to provide
himself with a basket, a flannel (to keep the
buns warm), and a cloth, to give a clean appearance
to his commodities. These articles, if
bought for the purpose, cost&mdash;basket, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
flannel and cloth, 2<i>s.</i>; stock-money, average, 5<i>s.</i>
(largest amount 15<i>s.</i>, smallest 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); or about
10<i>s.</i> in all.</p>

<p>There is expended in one day, in hot-cross
buns purchased in the London streets, 300<i>l.</i>, and
nearly 100,000 buns thus bought.</p>

<p>The Chelsea buns are now altogether superseded
by the Bath and Alexander’s buns. “People,”
the street-sellers say, “want so much for
their money.” There are now but two Chelsea
bun-houses; the one at Pimlico, and the other
at Chelsea. The principal times Chelsea buns
were sold in the streets was Good Friday,
Easter, and Whitsuntide; and, with the exception
of Good Friday, the great sales were at
Greenwich Fair, and then they were sold with
other cakes and sweetmeats. I am informed
that twenty years ago there was one man, with a
rich musical voice, who sold these buns, about
Westminster principally, all the year round; his
cry&mdash;which was one of the musical ones&mdash;was,
“One a penny, two a penny, hot Chelsea buns!
Burning hot! smoking hot! r-r-r-reeking hot!
hot Chelsea buns!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Muffin and Crumpet-selling in
the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The street-sellers of muffins and crumpets
rank among the old street-tradesmen. It is
difficult to estimate their numbers, but they
were computed for me at 500, during the winter
months. They are for the most part boys, young
men, or old men, and some of them infirm.
There are a few girls in the trade, but very few
women.</p>

<p>The ringing of the muffin-man’s bell&mdash;attached
to which the pleasant associations are not
a few&mdash;was prohibited by a recent Act of Parliament,
but the prohibition has been as inoperative
as that which forbad the use of a drum
to the costermonger, for the muffin bell still
tinkles along the streets, and is rung vigorously
in the suburbs. The sellers of muffins and
crumpets are a mixed class, but I am told that
more of them are the children of bakers, or
worn-out bakers, than can be said of any other
calling. The best sale is in the suburbs. “As
far as I know, sir,” said a muffin-seller, “it’s
the best Hackney way, and Stoke Newington,
and Dalston, and Balls Pond, and Islington;
where the gents that’s in banks&mdash;the steady
coves of them&mdash;goes home to their teas, and the
missuses has muffins to welcome them; that’s
my opinion.”</p>

<p>I did not hear of any street-seller who made
the muffins or crumpets he vended. Indeed, he
could not make the small quantity required, so
as to be remunerative. The muffins are bought
of the bakers, and at prices to leave a profit
of 4<i>d.</i> in 1<i>s.</i> Some bakers give thirteen to the
dozen to the street-sellers whom they know.
The muffin-man carries his delicacies in a
basket, wherein they are well swathed in
flannel, to retain the heat: “People likes them
warm, sir,” an old man told me, “to satisfy
them they’re fresh, and they almost always
<i>are</i> fresh; but it can’t matter so much about
their being warm, as they have to be toasted
again. I only wish good butter was a sight
cheaper, and that would make the muffins go.
Butter’s half the battle.” The basket and
flannels cost the muffin-man 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
His bell stands him in from 4<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>, “according
as the metal is.” The regular price of good-sized
muffins from the street-sellers is a halfpenny
each; the crumpets are four a penny.
Some are sold cheaper, but these are generally
smaller, or made of inferior flour. Most of the
street-sellers give thirteen, and some even fourteen
to the dozen, especially if the purchase be
made early in the day, as the muffin-man can
then, if he deem it prudent, obtain a further
supply.</p>

<p>A sharp London lad of fourteen, whose father
had been a journeyman baker, and whose mother
(a widow) kept a small chandler’s shop, gave me
the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I turns out with muffins and crumpets, sir,
in October, and continues until it gets well into
the spring, according to the weather. I carries
a fust-rate article; werry much so. If you was
to taste ’em, sir, you’d say the same. If I sells
three dozen muffins at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, and twice that
in crumpets, it’s a werry fair day, werry fair; all
beyond that is a <i>good</i> day. The profit on the
three dozen and the others is 1<i>s.</i>, but that’s a
great help, really a wonderful help, to mother, for
I should be only mindin’ the shop at home.
Perhaps I clears 4<i>s.</i> a week, perhaps more, perhaps
less; but that’s about it, sir. Some does
far better than that, and some can’t hold a
candle to it. If I has a hextra day’s sale,
mother’ll give me 3<i>d.</i> to go to the play, and that
hencourages a young man, you know, sir. If
there’s any unsold, a coffee-shop gets them
cheap, and puts ’em off cheap again next morning.
My best customers is genteel houses, ’cause
I sells a genteel thing. I likes wet days best,
’cause there’s werry respectable ladies what don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
keep a servant, and they buys to save themselves
going out. We’re a great conwenience
to the ladies, sir&mdash;a great conwenience to them
as likes a slap-up tea. I <i>have</i> made 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
in a day; that was my best. I once took
only 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>&mdash;I don’t know why&mdash;that was my
worst. The shops don’t love me&mdash;I puts their
noses out. Sunday is no better day than others,
or werry little. I can read, but wish I could
read easier.”</p>

<p>Calculating 500 muffin-sellers, each clearing
4<i>s.</i> a week, we find 100<i>l.</i> a week expended on
the metropolitan street sale of muffins; or, in
the course of twenty weeks, 2,000<i>l.</i> Five shillings,
with the price of a basket, &amp;c., which is
about 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> more, is the capital required for a
start.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sale of Sweet-stuff.</span></h3>

<p>In this sale there are now engaged, as one of
the most intelligent of the class calculated,
200 individuals, exclusive of twenty or thirty
Jew boys. The majority of the sellers are also
the manufacturers of the articles they vend.
They have all been brought up to the calling,
their parents having been in it, or having been
artizans (more especially bakers) who have
adopted it for some of the general reasons I
have before assigned. The non-makers buy of
the cheap confectioners.</p>

<p>The articles now vended do not differ materially,
I am informed by men who have known
the street trade for forty years, from those
which were in demand when they began selling
in the streets.</p>

<p>A very intelligent man, who had succeeded
his father and mother in the “sweet-stuff”
business&mdash;his father’s drunkenness having kept
them in continual poverty&mdash;showed me his apparatus,
and explained his mode of work. His
room, which was on the second-floor of a house
in a busy thoroughfare, had what I have frequently
noticed in the abodes of the working
classes&mdash;the decency of a turn-up bedstead. It
was a large apartment, the rent being 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week, unfurnished. The room was cheerful with
birds, of which there were ten or twelve. A remarkably
fine thrush was hopping in a large
wicker cage, while linnets and bullfinches
showed their quick bright eyes from smaller
cages on all sides. These were not kept for
sale but for amusement, their owner being
seldom able to leave his room. The father and
mother of this man cleared, twenty years ago,
although at that time sugar was 6<i>d.</i> or 7<i>d.</i>
the pound, from 2<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> a week by the sale
of sweet-stuff; half by keeping a stall, and
half by supplying small shops or other stall-keepers.
My present informant, however, who
has&mdash;not the best&mdash;but one of the best businesses
in London, makes 24<i>s.</i> or 25<i>s.</i> a week
from October to May, and scarcely 12<i>s.</i> a week
during the summer months, “when people love
to buy any cool fresh fruit instead of sweet-stuff.”
The average profits of the generality of
the trade do not perhaps exceed 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or
12<i>s.</i> a week, take the year round. They reside
in all parts.</p>

<p>Treacle and sugar are the ground-work of the
manufacture of all kinds of sweet-stuff. “Hardbake,”
“almond toffy,” “halfpenny lollipops,”
“black balls,” the cheaper “bulls eyes,” and
“squibs” are all made of treacle. One informant
sold more of treacle rock than of anything
else, as it was dispensed in larger halfpennyworths,
and no one else made it in the
same way. Of peppermint rock and sticks he
made a good quantity. Half-a-crown’s worth,
as retailed in the streets, requires 4 lbs. of rough
raw sugar at 4&frac14;<i>d.</i> per lb., 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> for scent (essence
of peppermint), 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> for firing, and &frac12;<i>d.</i> for
paper&mdash;in all 1<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> calculating nothing for
the labour and time expended in boiling and
making it. The profit on the other things was
proportionate, except on almond rock, which
does not leave 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> in a shilling&mdash;almonds
being dear. Brandy balls are made of sugar,
water, peppermint, and a little cinnamon. Rose
acid, which is a “transparent” sweet, is composed
of loaf sugar at 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb., coloured
with cochineal. The articles sold in “sticks”
are pulled into form along a hook until they
present the whitish, or speckled colour desired.
A quarter of a stone of materials will, for
instance, be boiled for forty minutes, and then
pulled a quarter of an hour, until it is sufficiently
crisp and will “set” without waste. The
flavouring&mdash;or “scent” as I heard it called in
the trade&mdash;now most in demand is peppermint.
Gibraltar rock and Wellington pillars used to
be flavoured with ginger, but these “sweeties”
are exploded.</p>

<p>Dr. Pereria, in his “Treatise on Diet,” enumerates
as many as ten different varieties and
preparations of sugar used for dietetical purposes.
These are (1) purified or refined sugar;
(2) brown or raw sugar; (3) molasses or treacle&mdash;or
fluid sugar; (4) aqueous solutions of sugar&mdash;or
syrups; (5) boiled sugars, or the softer
kinds of confectionary; (6) sugar-candy, or
crystallized cane sugar; (7) burnt sugar, or
caramel; (8) hard confectionary; (9) liquorice;
(10) preserves. The fifth and eighth varieties
alone concern us here.</p>

<p>Of the several preparations of <i>boiled sugar</i>,
the Doctor thus speaks, “If a small quantity
of water be added to sugar, the mixture
heated until the sugar dissolves, and the solution
boiled to drive off part of the water,
the tendency of the sugar to crystallise is
diminished, or, in some cases, totally destroyed.
To promote this effect, confectioners sometimes
add a small portion of cream of tartar to the
solution while boiling. Sugar, thus altered by
heat, and sometimes variously flavoured, constitutes
several preparations sold by the confectioner.
<i>Barley-sugar</i> and <i>acidulated drops</i> are
prepared in this way from white sugar: powdered
tartaric acid being added to the sugar
while soft. <i>Hardbake</i> and <i>toffee</i> are made by
a similar process from brown sugar. Toffee
differs from hardbake from containing butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The ornamented sugar pieces, or <i>caramel</i>-tops,
with which pastrycooks decorate their tarts,
&amp;c., are prepared in the same way. If the
boiled and yet soft sugar be rapidly and repeatedly
extended, and pulled over a hook, it
becomes opaque and white, and then constitutes
<i>pulled sugar</i>, or <i>penides</i>. Pulled sugar, variously
flavoured and coloured, is sold in several forms
by the preparers of hard confectionary.</p>

<p>“Concerning this <i>hard confectionary</i>,” Dr.
Pereira says, “sugar constitutes the base of an
almost innumerable variety of hard confectionary,
sold under the names of <i>lozenges</i>, <i>brilliants</i>,
<i>pipe</i>, <i>rock</i>, <i>comfits</i>, <i>nonpareils</i>, &amp;c. Besides
sugar, these preparations contain some flavouring
ingredient, as well as flour or gum, to give
them cohesiveness, and frequently colouring
matter. Carraway, fruits, almonds, and pine
seeds, constitute the nuclei of some of these
preparations.”</p>

<p>One of the appliances of the street sweet-stuff
trade which I saw in the room of the
seller before mentioned was&mdash;Acts of Parliament.
A pile of these, a foot or more deep, lay
on a shelf. They are used to wrap up the rock,
&amp;c., sold. The sweet-stuff maker (I never heard
them called confectioners) bought his “paper”
of the stationers, or at the old book-shops.
Sometimes, he said, he got works in this way
in sheets which had never been cut (some he
feared were stolen,) and which he retained to read
at his short intervals of leisure, and then used
to wrap his goods in. In this way he had read
through two Histories of England! He maintained
a wife, two young children, and a young
sister, who could attend to the stall; his wife
assisted him in his manufactures. He used
1 cwt. of sugar a week on the year’s average,
&frac12; cwt. of treacle, and 5 oz. of scents, each 8<i>d.</i>
an oz.</p>

<p>The man who has the best trade in London
streets, is one who, about two years ago, introduced&mdash;after
much study, I was told&mdash;short
sentences into his “sticks.” He boasts of his
secret. When snapped asunder, in any part,
the stick presents a sort of coloured inscription.
The four I saw were: “Do you love me?” The
next was of less touching character, “Do you
love sprats?” The others were, “Lord Mayor’s
Day,” and “Sir Robert Peel.” This man’s
profits are twice those of my respectable informant’s.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Customers of the Sweet-stuff
Street-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>Another sweet-stuff man, originally a baker,
but who, for a fortnight before I saw him, had
been attending upon an old gentleman, disabled
from an accident, gave me the following account
of his customers. What I heard from
the other street-sellers satisfies me of the correctness
of the statement. It will be seen that
he was possessed of some humour and observation:</p>

<p>“Boys and girls are my best customers, sir,
and mostly the smallest of them; but then,
again, some of them’s fifty, aye, turned fifty;
Lor’ love you. An old fellow, that hasn’t a
stump of a tooth in front, why, <i>he’ll</i> stop and
buy a ha’porth of hard-bake, and he’ll say,
‘I’ve a deal of the boy left about me still.’
He doesn’t show it, anyhow, in his look. I’m
sometimes a thinking I’ll introduce a softer
sort of toffy&mdash;boiled treacle, such as they call
Tom Trot in some parts, but it’s out of fashion
now, just for old people that’s ‘boys still.’ It
was rolled in a ha’penny stick, sir, and sold
stunnin’. The old ones wants something to suck,
and not to chew. Why, when I was a lad at
school, there was Jews used to go about with
boxes on their backs, offering rings and pencil-cases,
and lots of things that’s no real use to
nobody, and they told everybody they asked to
buy ‘that they sold everything,’ and us boys
used to say&mdash;‘Then give’s a ha’porth of boiled
treacle.’ It was a regular joke. I wish I’d
stuck more to my book then, but what can’t
be cured must be endured, you know. Now,
those poor things that walks down there”
(intimating, by a motion of the head, a
thoroughfare frequented by girls of the town),
“they’re often customers, but not near so
good as they was ten year ago; no, indeed, nor
six or eight year. <i>They</i> like something that
bites in the mouth, such as peppermint-rock, or
ginger-drops. They used to buy a penn’orth or
two and offer it to people, but they don’t now, I
think. I’ve trusted them ha’pennies and pennies,
sometimes. They always paid me. Some that
held their heads high like, might say: ‘I
really have no change; I’ll pay you to-morrow.’
She hadn’t no change, poor lass, sure enough,
and she hadn’t nothing to change either, I’ll go
bail. I’ve known women, that seemed working
men’s or little shopkeeper’s wives, buy of me
and ask which of my stuffs took greatest hold
of the breath. I always knew what they was
up to. They’d been having a drop, and didn’t
want it to be detected. Why, it was only last
Saturday week two niceish-looking and niceish-dressed
women, comes up to me, and one was
going to buy peppermint-rock, and the other
says to her: ‘Don’t, you fool, he’ll only think
you’ve been drinking gin-and-peppermint.
Coffee takes it off best.’ So I lost my customers.
They hadn’t had a <i>single</i> drain that night,
I’ll go bail, but still they didn’t look like regular
lushingtons at all. I make farthing’s-worths
of sweet-stuff, for children, but I don’t like
it; it’s an injury to trade. I <i>was</i> afraid that
when half-farthings was coined, they’d come
among children, and they’d want half a farthing
of brandy-balls. Now, talking of brandy-balls,
there’s a gentleman that sometimes has a minute’s
chat with me, as he buys a penn’orth to
take home to his children&mdash;(every reasonable
man ought to marry and have children for the
sake of the sweet-trade, but it ain’t the women’s
fault that many’s single still)&mdash;when one gentleman
I knows buys brandy-balls, he says,
quite grave, ‘What kind o’ brandy do you put
in them?’ ‘Not a drop of British,’ says I, ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
can assure you; not a single drop.’ He’s not
finely dressed; indeed, he’s a leetle seedy, but
I know he’s a gentleman, or what’s the same
thing, if he ain’t rich; for a common fellow’ll
never have his boots polished that way, every
day of his life; <i>his</i> blacking bills must come
heavy at Christmas. I can tell a gentleman,
too, by his way of talk, ’cause he’s never bumptious.
It’s the working people’s children that’s
my great support, and they was a better support,
by 2<i>s.</i> in every 10<i>s.</i>, and more, when times was
better; and next to them among my patrons
is poor people. Perhaps, this last year, I’ve
cleared 11<i>s.</i> a week, not more, all through. I
make my own stuffs, except the drops, and they
require machinery. I would get out of the
streets if I could.”</p>

<p>Another of these traders told me, that he
took more in farthings, than in halfpennies or
pennies.</p>

<p>Calculating 200 sweet-stuff sellers, each
clearing 10<i>s.</i> weekly, the outlay in rocks, candies,
hard-bakes, &amp;c., in the streets is 5,200<i>l.</i>
yearly, or nearly two and a half millions of
halfpenny-worths.</p>

<p>To start in the sweet-stuff business requires
a capital of 35<i>s.</i>, including a saucepan in which
to boil sugar, 2<i>s.</i>; weights and scales, 4<i>s.</i>;
stock-money (average), 4<i>s.</i>; and barrow, 25<i>s.</i>
If the seller be not his own manufacturer, then
a tray, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; and stock-money, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; or
3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> in all will be sufficient.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Cough Drops
and of Medical Confectionary.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of
the People of England” (1800), says of the
Mountebank: “It is uncertain at what period
this vagrant dealer in physic made his appearance
in England; it is clear, however, that he
figured away with much success in this country
during the last two centuries.... The
mountebanks usually preface the vending of
their medicines with pompous orations, in which
they pay as little regard to truth as to propriety.”
I am informed by a gentleman observant
of the matter, that within his knowledge,
which extends to the commencement of the
present century, no mountebank (proper) had
appeared in the streets of London proclaiming
the virtues of his medicines; neither with nor
without his “fool.” The last seen by my informant,
perhaps the latest mountebank in England,
was about twenty years ago, in the vicinity
of Yarmouth. He was selling “cough drops”
and infallible cures for asthma, and was dressed
in a periwig and an embroidered coat, with ruffles
at his wrist, a sword to his side, and was a
representation, in shabby genteel, of the fine
gentleman of the reign of Queen Anne. The
mountebank’s most legitimate successor in the
street cajolery of London, as regards his “orations,”
is the “Patterer,” as I shall show in
my account of the street trade in stationery
literature. His successor in the vending of
curative confectionaries and (in a small degree)
of nostrums, salves, ointments, &amp;c., are the
sellers of “cough drops” and “horehound
candy,” and of the corn salves, and cures for
bruises, sprains, burns, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The street-traders in cough drops and their
accompaniments, however, do not now exceed
six, and of them only two&mdash;who are near relatives&mdash;manufacture
their own stock-in-trade. I here
treat of the street trade in “cough drops,” as a
branch of the itinerant sweet-stuff trade. The
“mountebank” part of the business&mdash;that is to
say, “the prefacing the vending of the medicines
with <i>pompous orations</i>,” I shall reserve till its
proper place&mdash;viz. the “<i>pattering</i>” part of the
street trade, of which an account will be given
in the next Chapter.</p>

<p>The two principal vendors of cough drops
wheel their stalls, which are fixed upon barrows,
to different parts of town, but one principal
stand is in Holborn. On their boards are displayed
the cough cures, both in the form of
“sticks” and “drops,” and a model of a small
distillery. The portion inclosing the still is
painted to resemble brick-work, and a tin tube,
or worm, appears to carry the distillation to a
receiver. Horehound, colts-foot, and some
other herbs lie in a dried state on the stall, but
principally horehound, to which popular (street)
opinion seems to attach the most and the greatest
virtues. There are also on the stalls a few bottles,
tied up in the way they are dispensed from a
regular practitioner, while the cough drops are
in the form of sticks (&frac12;<i>d.</i> each), also neatly
wrapped in paper. The cry is both expressive
and simply descriptive&mdash;“Long life candy!
Candy from herbs!”</p>

<p>From the most experienced person in this
curious trade, I had the following statement.
He entertained a full assurance, as far as I
could perceive, of the excellence of his remedies,
and of the high art and mystery of his
calling. In persons of his class, professing to
heal, no matter in what capacity, or what may
be the disease, this is an important element of
success. My informant, whether answering my
questions or speaking of his own accord, always
took time to consider, and sometimes, as will be
seen, declined replying to my inquiries. From
him I received the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The cough drop and herb trade is nothing
now to what it was long ago. Thirty or forty
years ago, it was as good as 3<i>l.</i> or 4<i>l.</i> a week to
a person, and was carried on by respectable men.
I know nothing of any ‘humbugs’ in the respectable
part of the trade. What’s done by
those who are ignorant, and not respectable, is
nothing to me. I don’t know how many there
were in the trade thirty or forty years ago; but
I know that, ten or eleven years since, I supplied
seven persons who sold cough drops, and such
like, in the streets, and now I supply only myself
and another. I sell only four or five months in
the year&mdash;the cold months, in course; for, in
the summer, people are not so subject to coughs
and colds. I am the ‘original’ maker of my
goods. I will cure any child of the hooping-cough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and very speedily. I defy any medical
man to dispute it, and I’ll do it&mdash;‘no cure, no
pay.’ I never profess to cure asthma. Nobody
but a gravedigger can put an end to that there;
but I can relieve it. It’s the same with consumption;
it may be relieved, but the gravedigger
is the only man as can put a stop to it.
Many have tried to do it, but they’ve all failed.
I sell to very respectable people, and to educated
people, too; and, what’s more, a good deal (of
cough drops) to medical men. In course, they
can analyse it, if they please. They can taste
the bitter, and judge for themselves, just as they
can taste wine in the Docks. Perhaps the wives
of mechanics are among my best customers.
They are the most numerous, but they buy only
ha’porths and penn’orths. Very likely, they
would think more of the remedy if they had to
pay 13&frac12;<i>d.</i> for it, instead of the 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> The Government
stamp makes many a stuff sell. Oh! I
know nothing about quackery: you must inquire
at the Stamp-office, if you want to know about
them kind of medicines. <i>They’re</i> the people
that help to sell them. Respectable people will
pay me 1<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> at a time; and those who buy
once, buy again. I’m sent to from as far off
as Woolwich. I’ll undertake to cure, or afford
relief, in coughs, colds, or wind in the chest, or
forfeit 1<i>s.</i> I can dispel wind in two minutes. I
sell bottles, too, for those cures (as well as the
candy from herbs): I manufacture them myself.
They’re decoctions of herbs, and the way to prepare
them is my secret. I sell them at from 2<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> Why, I use one article that costs 24<i>s.</i> a
pound, foreign, and twice that English. I’ve
sold hundred weights. The decoctions are my
secret. I will instruct any person&mdash;and have
instructed a good many&mdash;when I’m paid for it.
In course, it would never do to publish it in
your work, for thousands would then learn it for
2<i>d.</i> My secret was never given to any person&mdash;only
with what you may call a fee&mdash;except one,
and only to him when he got married, and
started in the line. He’s a connection of mine.
All <i>we</i> sell is genuine.</p>

<p>“I sell herbs, too, but it’s not a street sale: I
supply them to orders from my connection. It’s
not a large trade. I sell horehound, for tea or
decoctions; coltsfoot, for smoking as herb tobacco
(I gather the coltsfoot myself, but buy the
horehound of a shopkeeper, as it’s cultivated);
ground-ivy is sold only for the blood (but little
of it); hyssop for wind; and Irish moss for
consumption. I’m never asked for anything
improper. They won’t ask <i>me</i> for &mdash;&mdash; or &mdash;&mdash;.
And I’m never asked for washes or cosmetics;
but a few nettles are ordered of me for complexions.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’d rather not state the quantities
I sell, or my profits, or prices. I make what
keeps myself, my wife, and seven children, and
that’s all I need say about it. I’d rather say no
more on that part of the business: and so, I’m
sure you won’t press me. I don’t know what
others in the trade make. They buy of confectioners,
and are only imitators of me. They buy
coltsfoot-candy, and such like; how it’s made
so cheap, I don’t know. In the summer, I give
up cough-drop selling, and take to gold fish.”</p>

<p>I am told that the cough-drop-makers, who
are also street-sellers, prepare their sticks, &amp;c.,
much in the same method as the manufacturers
of the ordinary sweet-stuff (which I have described),
using the decoction, generally of horehound
or coltsfoot, as the “scents” are used.
In the old times, it would appear that the preparation
of a medicinal confection was a much
more elaborate matter, if we may judge by the
following extract from an obsolete medical work
treating of the matter. The author styles such
preparations “lohochs,” which is an Arabic
word, he says, and signifies “a thing to be
licked.” It would appear that the lohoch was
not so hard as the present cough-drop. The
following is one of the receipts, “used generally
against diseases in the breast and lungs:”&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Lohoch de farfara,” the Lohoch of Coltsfoot.</i></p>

<p>Take of coltsfoot roots cleansed 8 ozs., marsh-mallow
roots 4 ozs., boil them in a sufficient quantity of water,
and press the pulp through a sieve, dissolve it again
in the decoction, and let it boil once or twice; then
take it from the fire, and add 2 lbs. of white sugar,
honey of raisins 14 ozs., juice of liquorice 2&frac12; drams,
stir them well with a wooden pestle, sprinkling in of
saffron and cloves in powder, of each 1 scruple, cinnamon
and mace, of each 2 scruples; make them into
a lohoch according to art. It is good for a cough and
roughness of the windpipe.</p></div>

<p>Without wishing to infringe upon professional
secrets, I may mention that the earnings of the
principal man in the trade may be taken at 30<i>s.</i>
a week for 20 weeks; that of another at 15<i>s.</i> for
the same period; and those of the remaining four
at 5<i>s.</i> each, weekly; but the latter sell acid
drops, and other things bought of the chemists.
Allowing the usual cent. per cent., we then find
130<i>l.</i> expended by street-buyers on cough-drops.</p>

<p>The best cough-drop stall seen in the streets
is a kind of barrow, which can be shut up like a
piano: it cost 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> complete with the distilling
apparatus before described. Scales and
weights cost 5<i>s.</i>, and the stock-money for the
supply of such a stall need not exceed 10<i>s.</i>; or,
in all, about 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> For an ordinary trade&mdash;ready-made
articles forming the stock&mdash;the
capital would be, stall and trestle, 7<i>s.</i>; scales
and weights (which are not always used),
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and stock-money, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; in all, 13<i>s.</i></p>

</div>


<p>A quick-witted street-seller&mdash;but not in the
“provision” line&mdash;conversing with me upon
this subject, said: “Ices in the streets! Aye,
and there’ll be jellies next, and then mock
turtle, and then the real ticket, sir. I don’t
know nothing of the difference between the real
thing and the mock, but I once had some cheap
mock in an eating-house, and it tasted like
stewed tripe with a little glue. You’ll keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
your eyes open, sir, at the Great Exhibition;
and you’ll see a new move or two in the streets,
take my word for it. Penny glasses of champagne,
I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sanguine anticipations
of my street friend, the sale of ices in the
streets has not been such as to offer any great
encouragement to a perseverance in the traffic.</p>

<p>The sale of ice-creams was unknown in the
streets until last summer, and was first introduced,
as a matter of speculation, by a man who
was acquainted with the confectionary business,
and who purchased his ices of a confectioner in
Holborn. He resold these luxuries daily to
street-sellers, sometimes to twenty of them, but
more frequently to twelve. The sale, however,
was not remunerative, and had it not been
generally united with other things, such as
ginger-beer, could not have been carried on as
a means of subsistence. The supplier of the
street-traders sometimes went himself, and sometimes
sent another to sell ice-cream in Greenwich
Park on fine summer days, but the sale
was sometimes insufficient to pay his railway
expenses. After three or four weeks’ trial, this
man abandoned the trade, and soon afterwards
emigrated to America.</p>

<p>Not many weeks subsequent to “the first
start,” I was informed, the trade was entered into
by a street-seller in Petticoat-lane, who had become
possessed, it was said, of Masters’s Freezing
Apparatus. He did not vend the ices himself
for more than two or three weeks, and moreover
confined his sale to Sunday mornings; after a
while he employed himself for a short time
in making ices for four or five street-sellers,
some of whom looked upon the preparation as a
wonderful discovery of his own, and he then
discontinued the trade.</p>

<p>There were many difficulties attending the
introduction of ices into street-traffic. The
buyers had but a confused notion how the ice
was to be swallowed. The trade, therefore,
spread only very gradually, but some of the
more enterprising sellers purchased stale ices
from the confectioners. So little, however, were
the street-people skilled in the trade, that a
confectioner told me they sometimes offered
ice to their customers in the streets, and could
supply only water! Ices were sold by the
street-vendors generally at 1<i>d.</i> each, and the
trade left them a profit of 4<i>d.</i> in 1<i>s.</i>, when they
served them “without waste,” and some of the
sellers contrived, by giving smaller modicums,
to enhance the 4<i>d.</i> into 5<i>d.</i>; the profit, however,
was sometimes what is expressively
called “nil.” Cent. per cent.&mdash;the favourite
and simple rate known in the streets as “half-profits”
was rarely attained.</p>

<p>From a street-dealer I received the following
<span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I mind very well the first time as
I ever sold ices. I don’t think they’ll ever
take greatly in the streets, but there’s no saying.
Lord! how I’ve seen the people splutter
when they’ve tasted them for the first time.
I did as much myself. They get among the
teeth and make you feel as if you tooth-ached
all over. I sold mostly strawberry ices. I
haven’t an idee how they’re made, but it’s a
most wonderful thing in summer&mdash;freezing
fruits in that way. One young Irish fellow&mdash;I
think from his look and cap he was a printer’s
or stationer’s boy&mdash;he bought an ice of me, and
when he had scraped it all together with the
spoon, he made a pull at it as if he was a drinking
beer. In course it was all among his teeth
in less than no time, and he stood like a stattey
for a instant, and then he roared out,&mdash;‘Jasus!
I’m kilt. The could shivers is on to me!’ But
I said, ‘O, you’re all right, you are;’ and he
says, ‘What d’you mane, you horrid horn,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> by
selling such stuff as that. An’ you must have
the money first, bad scran to the likes o’ you!’</p>

<p>“The persons what enjoyed their ices most,”
the man went on, “was, I think, servant maids
that gulped them on the sly. Pr’aps they’d been
used, some on ’em, to get a taste of ices on the
sly before, in their services. We sees a many
dodges in the streets, sir&mdash;a many. I knew one
smart servant maid, treated to an ice by her
young man&mdash;they seemed as if they was keeping
company&mdash;and he soon was stamping, with the
ice among his teeth, but she knew how to take
hern, put the spoon right into the middle of her
mouth, and when she’d had a clean swallow she
says: ‘O, Joseph, why didn’t you ask <i>me</i> to tell
you how to eat your ice?’ The conceit of sarvant
gals is ridiculous. Don’t you think so,
sir? But it goes out of them when they gets
married and has to think of how to get broth
before how to eat ices. One hot day, about
eleven, a thin tall gentleman, not very young,
threw down 1<i>d.</i> to me, and says, says he, ‘As
much ice as you can make for that.’ He knew
how to take it. When he’d done, he says, says
he, ‘By G&mdash;, my good feller, you’ve saved my
life. I’ve been keeping it up all night, and I
was dying of a burnt-up throat, after a snooze,
and had only 1<i>d.</i> So sick and hot was my
stomach, I could have knelt down and taken a
pull at the Thames’&mdash;we was near it at the
time&mdash;‘You’ve saved my life, and I’ll see you
again.’ But I’ve never see’d him since. He
was a gentleman, I think. He was in black,
and wore a big black and gold ring&mdash;only one.</p>

<p>“The rest of my customers for ices, was people
that bought out of curiosity, and there was
gentlemen’s servants among ’em, very little
fellows some of ’em; and doctors’ boys; and
mechanics as was young and seemed of a
smartish sort; and boys that seemed like
schoolboys; and a few women of the town,&mdash;but
mine’s not much of a pitch for them.”</p>

<p>From the information I obtained, I may state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that, if the sale of street ices be calculated at
twenty persons <i>taking</i>, not earning, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> daily
for four weeks, it is as near the mark as possible.
This gives an expenditure of 42<i>l.</i> in street ices,
with a profit to the vendors of from 10 to 25 per
cent. I am told that an unsuccessful start has
characterised other street trades&mdash;rhubarb for
instance, both in the streets and markets&mdash;which
have been afterwards successful and remunerative.</p>

<p>For capital in the ice trade a small sum was
necessary, as the vendors had all stalls and sold
other commodities, except the “original street
ice man,” who was not a regular street trader,
but a speculator. A jar&mdash;in which the ices
were neither sufficiently covered nor kept
cooled, though it was often placed in a vessel
or “cooler,” containing cold water&mdash;cost 1<i>s.</i>,
three cups, 3<i>d.</i> (or three glasses, 1<i>s.</i>), and
three spoons, 3<i>d.</i>, with 2<i>s.</i> stock-money; the
total is, presuming glasses were used, 4<i>s.</i>, or,
with a vessel for water, 5<i>s.</i></p>


<h3>OF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF EATABLES
AND DRINKABLES.</h3>

<p>I now give a summary of the Capital and Income
of the street-sellers of eatables and drinkables.
But, first, I will endeavour to arrive at an estimate
of the total number of people belonging to
the class.</p>

<p>The street-sellers engaged in the sale of
eatables and drinkables, are, summing the several
items before given, altogether 6,347: of
whom 300 sell pea-soup and hot eels; 150,
pickled whelks; 300, fried fish; 300, sheeps’
trotters; 60, ham-sandwiches; 200, baked ’tatoes;
4, hot green peas; 150, meat; 25, bread; 1,000,
cat and dogs’ meat; 300, coffee and tea; 1,700,
ginger-beer, lemonade, sherbet, &amp;c.; 50, elder-wine;
4, peppermint-water; 28, milk; 100,
curds and whey and rice-milk; 60, water; 50,
pies; 6, boiled pudding; 6, plum “duff”; 150,
cakes and tarts; 4, plum-cakes; 30, other cheaper
cakes; 150, gingerbread-nuts; 500, cross-buns;
500, muffins and crumpets; 200, sweet stuff;
6, cough-drops; 20, ice-creams. But many of
the above are only temporary trades. The street-sale
of hot cross-buns, for instance, lasts only
for a day; that of muffins and crumpets, baked
potatoes, plum-“duff,” cough-drops, elder-wine,
and rice-milk, are all purely winter trades, while
the sale of ginger-beer, lemonade, ice-creams,
and curds and whey, is carried on solely in the
summer. By this means the number of the
street-sellers of eatables and drinkables, never
at any one time reaches the amount before
stated. In summer there are, in addition to the
10,000 costers before mentioned, about 3,000
people, and in winter between 4,000 and 5,000,
engaged in the eatable and drinkable branch of
the street-traffic.</p>

<p>As regards the Capital and Income, many
minute accounts have been prepared.</p>

<p>To show the care, as well as the fulness with
which these returns have been made, I give one
of the Tables in its integrity, merely remarking,
that similar tables relative to all the other
articles have been made; but I condense the
details, lest a repetition, however curious in its
statistics, should prove wearisome:</p>

<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Hot Eels.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are upwards of 1,000,000 lbs. weight of hot eels sold yearly in the streets of London. 140 vendors each sell 6 lbs. of eels daily at their stands; 60 sell 40 lbs. daily; and 100 itinerant sell 5 lbs. nightly at the public-houses. The first mentioned take on an average 2<i>s.</i> daily; the second 16<i>s.</i>; and the third 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> This gives a yearly street expenditure in the trade in hot eels amounting to</td><td>£19,448</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Pea-soup.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The annual street consumption of pea-soup amounts to 1,680 gallons. 100 vendors sell each 4 gallons daily; and 50 vendors, each sell upon an average 10 gallons daily. The first mentioned take 3<i>s.</i> a day; and the last, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This gives a street expenditure during the winter season of five months, of</td><td>£4,050</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Pickled Whelks.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">According to the Billingsgate returns, there are nearly 5,000,000 of whelks sold yearly in the streets of London. These are retailed in a boiled state, and flavoured with vinegar, at four a penny. 150 vendors take on an average 13<i>s.</i> weekly. This gives an annual street expenditure, of</td><td>£5,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Fried Fish.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">150 sellers make 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, or yearly 27<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>; and 150 sellers make half that amount, 13<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> per annum. Reckoning 20<i>l.</i> a year as a medium earning, and adding 90 per cent. for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> profit, the annual consumption of fried fish supplied by London street-sellers amounts to 684,000 lbs., and the sum expended thereupon to</td><td>£11,400</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Sheep’s Trotters.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">In the wholesale “trotter” establishment there are prepared, weekly, 20,000 sets, or 80,000 feet; giving a yearly average of 4,160,000 trotters, or the feet of 1,040,000 sheep. Of this quantity the street-folk buy seven-eighths, or 3,640,000 trotters yearly. The number of sheep trotter-sellers may be taken at 300; which gives an average of nearly 60 sets a week per individual. There is then expended yearly in London streets on trotters, calculating their sale, retail, at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, 6,500<i>l.</i>; but though the regular price is &frac12;<i>d.</i>, some trotters are sold at four for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, very few higher than &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and some are kept until they are unsaleable, so that the amount thus expended may be estimated at</td><td>£6,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Ham-sandwiches.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">60 vendors, take 8<i>s.</i> a week, and sell annually 486,800 sandwiches, at a cost of</td><td>£1,800</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Baked ’Tatoes.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">300 vendors, sell upon an average &frac34; cwt. of baked potatoes daily, or 1,755 tons in the season. The average takings of each vendor amount to 6<i>s.</i> a day; and the receipts of the whole number throughout the season (which lasts from the latter end of September till March inclusive), a period of 6 months, are</td><td>£14,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>The Street-sellers of Hot Green Peas.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The chief man of business sells 3 gallons a day (which, at 1<i>d.</i> the quarter-pint, would be 8<i>s.</i>, my informant said 7<i>s.</i>), the other three together sell the same quantity; hence there is an annual street consumption of 1,870 gallons, and a street expenditure on “hot green peas” of</td><td>£250</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Meat.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The hawking butchers, taking their number at 150, sell 747,000 lbs. of meat, and take annually</td><td>£12,450</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Bread.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">25 men take 45<i>s.</i> a day for five months in the summer, and 12 regular traders take 1<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> per day; this gives an annual street consumption of 700,000 quartern loaves of bread, and a street expenditure of</td><td>£9,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Cats and Dogs’ Meat.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are 300,000 cats in the metropolis, and from 900 to 1,000 horses, averaging 2 cwt. of meat each, boiled down every week; the quantity of cats’ and dogs’ meat used throughout London is about 200,000 lbs. per week, and this, sold at the rate of 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb., gives 2,000<i>l.</i> a week for the money spent in cats’ and dogs’ meat, or per year, upwards of</td><td>£100,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Coffee, Tea, &amp;c.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Each coffee-stall keeper on an average clears 1<i>l.</i> a week, and his takings may be said to be at least double that sum; hence the quantity of coffee sold annually in the streets, is about 550,000 gallons, while the yearly street expenditure for tea, coffee, &amp;c., amounts to</td><td>£31,200</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Ginger-beer.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The bottles of ginger-beer sold yearly in the streets number about 4,798,000, and the total street consumption of the same beverage may be said to be about 250,000 gallons per annum. 200 street-sellers of ginger-beer in the bottle trade of the penny class take 30<i>s.</i> a week each (thus allowing for inferior receipts in bad weather); 300 take 20<i>s.</i> each, selling their “beer” for the most part at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the bottle, while the remaining 400 “in a small way” take 6<i>s.</i> each; hence there is expended in the bottled ginger-beer of the streets 11,480<i>l.</i> Adding the receipts from the fountains and the barrels, the barrel season continuing only ten weeks, the total sum expended annually in street ginger-beer amounts altogether to</td><td>£14,660</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Lemonade, Sherbet, Nectar, &amp;c.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are 200 persons, chiefly men, selling solely lemonade, &amp;c., and an additional 300 uniting the sale with that of ginger-beer. Their average receipts on fine days are 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, or, allowing for wet weather and diminished receipts, 10<i>s.</i> a week. The receipts, then, for this street luxury, show a street expenditure in such a summer as the last, of 2,800<i>l.</i>, among those who do not unite ginger-beer with the trade. Calculating that those who <i>do</i> unite ginger-beer with it sell only one-half as much as the others, we find a total outlay of</td><td>£4,900</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Elder-wine.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">50 vendors clear 5<i>s.</i> a week for 16 weeks by the sale of elder-wine in the streets, their profit being at least cent. per cent.; hence the street consumption of this beverage in the course of the year is 1,500 gallons, and the outlay</td><td>£200</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Peppermint-water.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Calculating that 4 “pepperminters” take 2<i>s.</i> a day the year round, Sundays excepted, we find that 900 gallons of peppermint-water are consumed every year in the streets of London, while the sum expended in it amounts annually to</td><td>£125</td></tr>

<tr><th><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span><i>Street-sellers of Milk in the Markets, Parks, &amp;c.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The vendors in the markets clear about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day each, for three months; and as the profit is rather more than cent. per cent., there are about 4,000 gallons of milk thus sold yearly. The quantity sold in the park averages 20 quarts a day for a period of nine months, or 1,170 gallons in the year. This is retailed at 4<i>d.</i> per quart; hence the annual expenditure is</td><td>£344</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Curds and Whey.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">50 sellers dispose of 12&frac12; gallons in 3 weeks; the other 50 sell only half as much. Taking the season at 3 months, the annual consumption of curds and whey in the streets is 2,812 double gallons (as regards the ingredients of milk), which is retailed at a cost to the purchasers of</td><td>£412</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Rice-milk.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Calculating that 50 sellers dispose of 24 quarts weekly, while one-half of the remaining 25 sell 12 quarts each per week at 1<i>d.</i> the half-pint, and the other half vend 24 quarts at &frac12;<i>d.</i> the half-pint, there are about 3,000 gallons of rice-milk yearly consumed in the streets of London, while the expenditure amounts to</td><td>£320</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Water-carriers.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The number of water-carriers are sixty, and their average earnings through the year 5<i>s.</i> a week; hence the sum annually expended in water thus obtained amounts to</td><td>£780</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street Piemen.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are fifty street piemen plying their trade in London, the year through, their average takings are one guinea a week; hence there is an annual street consumption of pies of nearly to three-quarters of a million, and a street expenditure amounting to</td><td>£3,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Meat and Currant Puddings.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Each street-seller gets rid of, on an average, 85 dozen, or 1,020 puddings; there are now but six street-sellers (regularly) of these comestibles; hence the weekly aggregate would be&mdash;allowing for bad weather&mdash;5,400, and the total 129,600 meat and currant puddings sold in the streets, in a season of 24 weeks. This gives an annual expenditure on the part of the street boys and girls (who are the principal purchasers), and of the poor persons who patronise the street-trade, of about</td><td>£270</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Plum “duff.”</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Calculating 42<i>s.</i> a week as the takings of six persons, for five months, we find there is yearly expended in the street purchase of plum dough upwards of</td><td>£250</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Cakes, Tarts, &amp;c.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Reckoning 150 cake-sellers, each taking 6<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;a sufficiently low average&mdash;the street consumption of cakes, tarts, &amp;c., will be 1,123,200 every year, and the street outlay about</td><td>£2,350</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of other and inferior Cakes.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The sale of the inferior street cakes realises about a fifth of that taken by the other cake-sellers; hence it may be estimated yearly at</td><td>£450</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Gingerbread-nuts.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">150 gingerbread-nut-sellers take 17<i>s.</i> each weekly (clearing 9<i>s.</i>); at this rate the sum spent yearly in “spice” nuts in the streets of London amounts to</td><td>£6,630</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Hot-cross Buns.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are nearly 100,000 hot-cross buns sold every Good Friday in the streets of London; hence there is expended in one day, upon the buns thus bought about</td><td>£300</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Muffins and Crumpets.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are 500 muffin-sellers, each clearing 4<i>s.</i> and taking 12<i>s.</i> a week on an average; hence the metropolitan street sale of muffins and crumpets will be in 20 weeks about 120,000 dozen, and the sum expended thereon</td><td>£6,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Sweet-stuff.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The number of sweet-stuff sellers in London amounts to 200, each of whom, on an average, clears 10<i>s.</i>, and takes 20<i>s.</i> weekly; the yearly consumption, therefore, of rocks, candies, hard-bakes, &amp;c., purchased in the streets is nearly two and a half millions of halfpenny-worths, or (at the rate of &frac12;<i>d.</i> an ounce) about 70 tons weight per annum, costing the consumers about</td><td>£10,000</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Cough-drops.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The earnings of the principal man in the “cough-drop” street trade may be taken at 30<i>s.</i> a week for twenty weeks; that of another at 15<i>s.</i> for the same period; and those of the remaining four street-sellers of the same compound at 5<i>s.</i> each, weekly; allowing the usual cent. per cent., we find there is annually expended by street-buyers on cough-drops</td><td>£130</td></tr>
<tr><th><i>Street-sellers of Ice Creams.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The sale of street ices may be calculated at twenty persons, taking 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> daily for four weeks. This gives a street consumption of 10,000 penny ices, and an annual expenditure thereon of</td><td>£42</td></tr>

<h2 class="nobreak">OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF STATIONERY, LITERATURE,
AND THE FINE ARTS.</h2>
</div>


<p>We now come to a class of street-folk wholly
distinct from any before treated of. As yet we
have been dealing principally with the uneducated
portion of the street-people&mdash;men whom, for the
most part, are allowed to remain in nearly the
same primitive and brutish state as the savage&mdash;creatures
with nothing but their appetites,
instincts, and passions to move them, and made
up of the same crude combination of virtue and
vice&mdash;the same generosity combined with the
same predatory tendencies as the Bedouins of
the desert&mdash;the same love of revenge and disregard
of pain, and often the same gratitude
and susceptibility to kindness as the Red
Indian&mdash;and, furthermore, the same insensibility
to female honour and abuse of female
weakness, and the same utter ignorance of the
Divine nature of the Godhead as marks either
Bosjesman, Carib, or Thug.</p>

<p>The costers and many other of the street-sellers
before described, however, are bad&mdash;not
so much from their own perversity as from our
selfishness. That they partake of the natural
evil of human nature is not their fault but ours,&mdash;who
would be like them if we had not been
taught by others better than ourselves to controul
the bad and cherish the good principles of
our hearts.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of stationery, literature, and
the fine arts, however, differ from all before
treated of in the <i>general</i>, though far from universal,
education of the sect. They constitute
principally the class of street-orators, known in
these days as “patterers,” and formerly termed
“mountebanks,”&mdash;people who, in the words of
Strutt, strive to “help off their wares by pompous
speeches, in which little regard is paid
either to truth or propriety.” To patter, is a
slang term, meaning to speak. To indulge in
this kind of oral puffery, of course, requires a
certain exercise of the intellect, and it is the
consciousness of their mental superiority which
makes the patterers look down upon the costermongers
as an inferior body, with whom they
object either to be classed or to associate. The
scorn of some of the “patterers” for the mere
costers is as profound as the contempt of the
pickpocket for the pure beggar. Those who
have not witnessed this pride of class among
even the most degraded, can form no adequate
idea of the arrogance with which the skilled
man, no matter how base the art, looks upon
the unskilled. “We are the haristocracy of the
streets,” was said to me by one of the street-folks,
who told penny fortunes with a bottle.
“People don’t pay us for what we gives ’em,
but only to hear us talk. We live like yourself,
sir, by the hexercise of our hintellects&mdash;we by
talking, and you by writing.”</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the self-esteem of the
patterers, I am inclined to think that they are
less impressionable and less susceptible of kindness
than the costers whom they despise. Dr.
Conolly has told us that, even among the insane,
the educated classes are the most difficult to
move and govern through their affections. They
are invariably suspicious, attributing unworthy
motives to every benefit conferred, and consequently
incapable of being touched by any
sympathy on the part of those who may be
affected by their distress. So far as my experience
goes it is the same with the street-patterers.
Any attempt to befriend them is almost
sure to be met with distrust. Nor does their
mode of life serve in any way to lessen their misgivings.
Conscious how much their own livelihood
depends upon assumption and trickery,
they naturally consider that others have some
“dodge,” as they call it, or some latent object
in view when any good is sought to be done
them. The impulsive costermonger, however,
approximating more closely to the primitive
man, moved solely by his feelings, is as easily
humanized by any kindness as he is brutified by
any injury.</p>

<p>The patterers, again, though certainly more
intellectual, are scarcely less immoral than the
costers. Their superior cleverness gives them
the power of justifying and speciously glossing
their evil practices, but serves in no way to
restrain them; thus affording the social philosopher
another melancholy instance of the evil of
developing the intellect without the conscience&mdash;of
teaching people to <i>know</i> what is morally
beautiful and ugly, without teaching them at
the same time to feel and delight in the one and
abhor the other&mdash;or, in other words, of quickening
the cunning and checking the emotions of
the individual.</p>

<p>Among the patterers marriage is as little
frequent as among the costermongers; with the
exception of the older class, who “were perhaps
married before they took to the streets.”
Hardly one of the patterers, however, has been
bred to a street life; and this constitutes another
line of demarcation between them and the costermongers.</p>

<p>The costers, we have seen, are mostly hereditary
wanderers&mdash;having been as it were born
to frequent the public thoroughfares; some
few of the itinerant dealers in fish, fruit, and
vegetables, have it is true been driven by want
of employment to adopt street-selling as a
means of living, but these are, so to speak, the
aliens rather than the natives of the streets.
The patterers, on the other hand, have for the
most part neither been born and bred nor
driven to a street life&mdash;but have rather <i>taken</i>
to it from a natural love of what they call
“roving.” This propensity to lapse from a
civilized into a nomad state&mdash;to pass from a
settler into a wanderer&mdash;is a peculiar charac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>teristic
of the pattering tribe. The tendency
however is by no means extraordinary; for
ethnology teaches us, that whereas many abandon
the habits of civilized life to adopt those
of a nomadic state of existence, but few of the
wandering tribes give up vagabondising and
betake themselves to settled occupations. The
innate “love of a roving life,” which many of
the street-people themselves speak of as the
cause of their originally taking to the streets,
appears to be accompanied by several peculiar
characteristics; among the most marked of
these are an indomitable “self-will” or hatred
of the least restraint or controul&mdash;an innate
aversion to every species of law or government,
whether political, moral, or domestic&mdash;a stubborn,
contradictory nature&mdash;an incapability of
continuous labour, or remaining long in the
same place occupied with the same object,
or attending to the same subject&mdash;an unusual
predilection for amusements, and especially for
what partakes of the ludicrous&mdash;together with
a great relish of all that is ingenious, and so
finding extreme delight in tricks and frauds of
every kind. There are two patterers now in
the streets (brothers)&mdash;well-educated and respectably
connected&mdash;who candidly confess
they prefer that kind of life to any other, and
would not leave it if they could.</p>

<p>Nor are the patterers less remarkable than the
costermongers for their utter absence of all religious
feeling. There is, however, this distinction
between the two classes&mdash;that whereas the
creedlessness of the one is but the consequence
of brutish ignorance, that of the other is the
result of natural perversity and educated scepticism&mdash;as
the street-patterers include many men
of respectable connections, and even classical
attainments. Among them, may be found the
son of a military officer, a clergyman, a man
brought up to the profession of medicine, two
Grecians of the Blue-coat School, clerks, shopmen,
and a class who have been educated to no
especial calling&mdash;some of the latter being the
natural sons of gentlemen and noblemen&mdash;and
who, when deprived of the support of their
parents or friends, have taken to the streets for
bread. Many of the younger and smarter men,
I am assured, reside with women of the town,
though they may not be dependent for their
livelihood on the wages got by the infamy of
these women. Not a few of the patterers, too,
in their dress and appearance, present but little
difference to that of the “gent.” Some wear a
moustache, while others indulge in a Henri-Quatre
beard. The patterers are, moreover, as
a body, not distinguished by that good and
friendly feeling one to another which is remarkable
among costermongers. If an absence of
heartiness and good fellowship be characteristic
of an aristocracy&mdash;as some political philosophers
contend&mdash;then the patterers may indeed be said
to be the aristocrats of the streets.</p>

<p>The patterers or oratorical street-sellers include
among their class many itinerant traders,
other than the wandering “paper-workers”&mdash;as
those vending the several varieties of street-literature
are generally denominated. The
Cheap Jacks, or oratorical hucksters of hardware
at fairs and other places, are among the
most celebrated and humorous of this class.
The commercial arts and jests of some of these
people, display considerable cleverness. Many
of their jokes, it is true, are traditional&mdash;and
as purely a matter of parrotry as the witticisms
of the “funny gentlemen” on the stage, but
their ready adaptation of accidental circumstances
to the purposes of their business,
betrays a modicum of wit far beyond that
which falls to the share of ordinary “low
comedians.” The street-vendors of cough
drops&mdash;infallible cures for the toothache and
other ailments&mdash;also belong to the pattering
class. These are, as was before stated, the
remains of the obsolete mountebanks of England
and the <i>saltinbanque</i> of France&mdash;a class
of <i>al fresco</i> orators who derived their names
from the <i>bench</i>&mdash;the street pulpit, rostrum, or
platform&mdash;that they ascended, in order the better
to deliver their harangues. The street jugglers,
actors, and showmen, as well as the street-sellers
of grease-removing compositions, corn-salve,
razor-paste, plating-balls, waterproof blacking,
rat poisons, sovereigns sold for wagers, and a
multiplicity of similar street-trickeries&mdash;such as
oratorical begging&mdash;are other ingenious and
wordy members of the same chattering, jabbering,
or “pattering” fraternity. These will all
be spoken of under the head of the different
things they respectively sell or do. For the present
we have only to deal with that portion of
the “pattering” body who are engaged in the
street sale of literature&mdash;or the “paper-workers”
as they call themselves. The latter include the
“running patterers,” or “death-hunters;” being
men (no women) engaged in vending last dying
speeches and confessions&mdash;in hawking “se-cond
edi-tions” of newspapers&mdash;or else in “working,”
that is to say, in getting rid of what are technically
termed “cocks;” which, in polite language,
means accounts of fabulous duels between ladies
of fashion&mdash;of apocryphal elopements, or fictitious
love-letters of sporting noblemen and certain
young milliners not a hundred miles from
the spot&mdash;“cooked” assassinations and sudden
deaths of eminent individuals&mdash;pretended jealous
affrays between Her Majesty and the Prince
Consort (but these papers are now never worked)&mdash;or
awful tragedies, including mendacious
murders, impossible robberies, and delusive
suicides.</p>

<p>The sellers of these choice articles, however,
belong more particularly to that order or species
of the pattering genus known as “running patterers,”
or “flying stationers,” from the fact of
their being continually on the move while describing
the attractions of the “papers” they
have to sell. Contradistinguished from them,
however, are the “standing patterers,” or those
for whose less startling announcements a crowd
is necessary, in order that the audience may have
time to swallow the many marvels worked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
their wares. The standing patterers require,
therefore, what they term a “pitch,” that is to
say a fixed locality, where they can hold forth
to a gaping multitude for, at least, some few
minutes continuously. They are mainly such
street-sellers as deal in nostrums and the different
kinds of street “wonders.” Occasionally,
however, the running patterer (who is especially
literary) transmigrates into a standing one, betaking
himself to “board work,” as it is termed
in street technology, and stopping at the corners
of thoroughfares with a large pictorial placard
raised upon a pole, and glowing with a highly-coloured
exaggeration of the interesting terrors
of the pamphlet he has for sale. This is either
“The Life of Calcraft, the Hangman,” “The
Diabolical Practices of Dr. &mdash;&mdash; on his Patients
when in a state of Mesmerism,” or “The
Secret Doings at the White House, Soho,” and
other similar attractively-repulsive details. Akin
to this “board work” is the practice of what
is called “strawing,” or selling straws in the
street, and giving away with them something
that is either really or fictionally forbidden to be
sold,&mdash;as indecent papers, political songs, and
the like. This practice, however, is now seldom
resorted to, while the sale of “secret papers” is
rarely carried on in public. It is true, there
are three or four patterers who live chiefly by
professing to dispose of “sealed packets” of
obscene drawings and cards for gentlemen; but
this is generally a trick adopted to extort money
from old debauchees, young libertines, and people
of degraded or diseased tastes; for the packets,
on being opened, seldom contain anything but
an odd number of some defunct periodical. There
is, however, a large traffic in such secret papers
carried on in what is called “the public-house
trade,” that is to say, by itinerant “paper-workers”
(mostly women), who never make their
appearance in the streets, but obtain a livelihood
by “busking,” as it is technically termed, or, in
other words, by offering their goods for sale only
at the bars and in the tap-rooms and parlours
of taverns. The excessive indulgence of one
appetite is often accompanied by the disease
of a second; the drunkard, of course, is supereminently
a sensualist, and is therefore easily
taken by anything that tends to stimulate his
exhausted desires: so sure is it that one form
of bestiality is a necessary concomitant of another.
There is another species of patterer, who,
though usually included among the standing
patterers, belongs rather to an intermediate
class, viz., those who neither stand nor “<i>run</i>,”
as they descant upon what they sell; but those
walk at so slow a rate that, though never stationary,
they can hardly be said to move.
These are the reciters of dialogues, litanies,
and the various street “squibs” upon passing
events; they also include the public propounders
of conundrums, and the “hundred
and fifty popular song” enumerators&mdash;such as
are represented in the engraving here given.
Closely connected with them are the “chaunters,”
or those who do not cry, but (if one may so far
stretch the English language) <i>sing</i> the contents
of the “papers” they vend.</p>

<p>These traffickers constitute the principal
street-sellers of literature, or “paper-workers,”
of the “pattering” class. In addition to them
there are many others vending “papers” in
the public thoroughfares, who are mere traders
resorting to no other acts for the disposal of their
goods than a simple cry or exposition of them;
and many of these are but poor, humble, struggling,
and inoffensive dealers. They do not puff
or represent what they have to sell as what it is
not&mdash;(allowing them a fair commercial latitude).
They are not of the “enterprising” class of
street tradesmen. Among these are the street-sellers
of stationery&mdash;such as note-paper, envelopes,
pens, ink, pencils, sealing-wax, and
wafers. Belonging to the same class, too, are
the street-vendors of almanacs, pocket-books,
memorandum and account-books. Then there
are the sellers of odd numbers of periodicals
and broadsheets, and those who vend either
playing cards, conversation cards, stenographic
cards, and (at Epsom, Ascot, &amp;c.) racing cards.
Besides these, again, there are the vendors of
illustrated cards, such as those embellished with
engravings of the Crystal Palace, Views of the
Houses of Parliament, as well as the gelatine
poetry cards&mdash;all of whom, with the exception
of the racing-card sellers (who belong generally
to the pattering tribe), partake of the usual
characteristics of the street-selling class.</p>

<p>After these may be enumerated the vendors
of old engravings out of inverted umbrellas, and
the hawkers of coloured pictures in frames.
Then there are the old book-stalls and barrows,
and “the pinners-up,” as they are termed, or
sellers of old songs pinned against the wall, as
well as the vendors of manuscript music. Moreover,
appertaining to the same class, there are
the vendors of playbills and “books of the performance”
outside the theatre; and lastly, the
pretended sellers of tracts&mdash;such as the Lascars
and others, who use this kind of street traffic as
a cloak for the more profitable trade of begging.
The street-sellers of images, although strictly
comprised within those who vend fine art productions
in the public thoroughfares will be
treated of under the head of <span class="smcap">The Street Italians</span>,
to which class they mostly belong.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the former and present Street-patterers.</span></h3>

<p>Of the street-patterers the running (or flying)
trader announces the contents of the paper he is
offering for sale, as he proceeds on his mission.
It is usually the detail of some “barbarious and
horrible murder,” or of some extraordinary occurrence&mdash;such
as the attack on Marshal Haynau&mdash;which
has roused public attention; or the paper
announced as descriptive of a murder, or of
some exciting event, may in reality be some
odd number of a defunct periodical. “It’s
astonishing,” said one patterer to me, “how few
people ever complain of having been took in. It
hurts their feelings to lose a halfpenny, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hurts their pride too much, when they’re had, to
grumble in public about it.” On this head,
then, I need give no further general explanation.</p>

<p>In times of excitement the running patterer (or
“stationer,” as he was and is sometimes called)
has reaped the best harvest. When the Popish
plot agitated England in the reign of Charles II.
the “Narratives” of the design of a handful of
men to assassinate a whole nation, were eagerly
purchased in the streets and taverns. And this
has been the case during the progress of any absorbing
event subsequently. I was told by a very
old gentleman, who had heard it from his grandfather,
that in some of the quiet towns of the
north of England, in Durham and Yorkshire,
there was the greatest eagerness to purchase
from the street-sellers any paper relative to the
progress of the forces under Charles Edward
Stuart, in 1745. This was especially the case
when it became known that the “rebels” had
gained possession of Carlisle, and it was uncertain
what might be their route southward.
About the period of the “affair of the ’45,”
and in the autumn following the decisive battle
of Culloden (in April, 1746), the “Northern
Lights” were more than usually brilliant, or
more than usually remarked, and a meteor or
two had been seen. The street-sellers were then
to be found in fairs and markets, vending wonderful
accounts of these wonderful phenomena.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the character of
the old mountebank, and to his “pompous
orations,” having “as little regard to truth as to
propriety.” There certainly is little pompousness
in the announcements of the patterers,
though in their general disregard of truth they
resemble those of the mountebank. The
mountebank, however, addressed his audience
from a stage, and made his address attractive
by mixing up with it music, dancing, and
tumbling; sometimes, also, equestrianism on
the green of a village; and by having always
the services of a merry-andrew, or clown. The
nostrums of these quacks were all as unequalled
for cheapness as for infallibility, and their impudence
and coolness ensured success. Their
practices are as well exposed in some of the
<i>Spectators</i> of 1711-12 as the puppet-playing of
Powel was good-humouredly ridiculed. One
especial instance is cited, where a mountebank,
announcing himself a native of Hammersmith,
where he was holding forth, offered to make a
present of 5<i>s.</i> to every brother native of Hammersmith
among his audience. The mountebank
then drew from a long bag a handful of
little packets, each of which, he informed the
spectators, was constantly sold for 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but
that out of love to his native hamlet he would
bate the odd 5<i>s.</i> to every inhabitant of the place.
The whole assembly immediately closed with
his generous offer.</p>

<p>There is a scene in Moncrieff’s popular farce
of “<i>Rochester</i>,” where the hero personates a
mountebank, which may be here cited as affording
a good idea of the “pompous orations” indulged
in by the street orators in days of yore:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Silence there, and hear me, for my words are more
precious than gold; I am the renowned and far-famed
Doctor Paracelsus Bombastes Esculapus Galen dam
Humbug von Quack, member of all the colleges under
the Moon: M.D., L.M.D., F.R.S., L.L.D., <i>A.S.S.</i>&mdash;and
all the rest of the letters in the alphabet: I am the
seventh son of a seventh son&mdash;kill or cure is my motto&mdash;and
I always do it; I cured the great Emperor of
Nova Scotia, of a polypus, after he had been given over
by all the faculty&mdash;he lay to all appearance dead; the
first pill he took, he opened his eyes; the second, he
raised his head; and the third, he jumped up and
danced a hornpipe. I don’t want to sound my own
praise&mdash;blow the trumpet, Balaam (<i>Balaam blows
trumpet</i>); but I tapped the great Cham of Tartary at a
sitting, of a terrible dropsy, so that I didn’t leave a
drop in him! I cure the palsy, the dropsy, the lunacy,
and all the sighs, without costing anybody a sigh;
vertigo, pertigo, lumbago, and all the other go’s are
sure to go, whenever I come.”</p></div>

<p>In his unscrupulousness and boldness in street
announcements, and sometimes in his humour
and satire, we find the patterer of the present
day to be the mountebank of old descended from
his platform into the streets&mdash;but without his
music, his clown, or his dress.</p>

<p>There was formerly, also, another class, differing
little from the habits of that variety of
patterers of the present day who “busk” it, or
“work the public-houses.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The jestours,” says Mr. Strutt, in his “Sports and
Pastimes of the People of England,” “or, as the word
is often written in the old English dialect, ‘gesters,’
were the relaters of the gestes, that is, the actions of
famous persons, whether fabulous or real; and these
stories were of two kinds, the one to excite pity, and
the other to move laughter, as we learn from Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘And jestours that tellen tales,</div>
       <div class="verse">Both of wepying and of game.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tales of ‘game,’ as the poet expresses himself
were short jocular stories calculated to promote merriment,
in which the reciters paid little respect to the
claims of propriety or even of common decency. The
tales of ‘game,’ however, were much more popular
than those of weeping, and probably for the very
reason that ought to have operated the most powerfully
for their suppression. The gestours, whose
powers were chiefly employed in the hours of conviviality,
finding by experience that lessons of instruction
were much less seasonable at such times, than idle tales
productive of mirth and laughter, accommodated their
narrations to the general taste of the times, regardless
of the mischiefs they occasioned by vitiating the
morals of their hearers. Hence it is that the author
of the ‘Vision of Pierce the Ploughman’ calls them
contemptibly ‘japers and juglers, and janglers of
gests.’ He describes them as haunters of taverns and
common ale-houses, amusing the lower classes of the
people with ‘myrth of minstrelsy and losels’ tales,’
(loose vulgar tales,) and calls them tale-tellers and
‘tutelers in ydell,’ (tutors of idleness,) occasioning their
auditory, ‘for love of tales, in tavernes to drink,’
where they learned from them to jangle and to jape,
instead of attending to their more serious duties.</p>

<p>“The japers, I apprehend, were the same as the
bourdours, or rybauders, an inferior class of minstrels,
and properly called jesters in the modern acceptation
of the word; whose wit, like that of the
merry-andrews of the present day (1800) consisted in
low obscenity accompanied with ludicrous gesticulation.
They sometimes, however, found admission into
the houses of the opulent. Knighton, indeed, mentions
one of these japers who was a favourite in the
English court, and could obtain any grant from the
king ‘a burdando,’ that is, by jesting. They are well
described by the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘As japers and janglers, Judas’ chyldren,</div>
       <div class="verse">Fayneth them fantasies, and fooles them maketh.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>“It was a very common and a very favourite amusement,
so late as the 16th century, to hear the recital of
verses and moral speeches, learned for that purpose
by a set of men who obtained their livelihood thereby,
and who, without ceremony, intruded themselves, not
only into taverns and other places of public resort, but
also into the houses of the nobility.”</p></div>

<p>The resemblance of the modern patterer to
the classes above mentioned will be seen when I
describe the public-house actor and reciter of
the present day, as well as the standing patterer,
who does not differ so much from the running
patterer in the quality of his announcements, as
in his requiring more time to make an impression,
and being indeed a sort of lecturer needing
an audience; also of the present reciters “of
verses and moral speeches.” But of these curious
classes I shall proceed to treat separately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Habits, Opinions, Morals, and
Religion of Patterers generally.</span></h3>

<p>In order that I might omit nothing which will
give the student of that curious phase of London
life in London streets&mdash;the condition of the
patterers&mdash;a clear understanding of the subject,
I procured the following account from an educated
gentleman (who has been before alluded
to in this work), and as he had been driven to
live among the class he describes, and to support
himself by street-selling, his remarks have
of course all the weight due to personal experience,
as well as to close <span class="lock">observation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If there is any truth in phrenology,” writes
the gentleman in question, “the patterers&mdash;to
a man&mdash;are very large in the organ of ‘self-esteem,’
from which suggestion an enquiry
arises, viz., whether they possess that of which
they may justly pique themselves. To arrive at
truth about the patterers is very difficult, and
indeed the persons with whom they live are
often quite in the dark about the history, or in
some cases the pursuits of their lodgers.</p>

<p>“I think that the patterers may be divided into
three classes. First,&mdash;those who were well born
and brought up. Secondly,&mdash;those whose
parents have been dissipated and gave them
little education. Thirdly,&mdash;those who&mdash;whatever
their early history&mdash;will not be or do anything
but what is of an itinerant character. I
shall take a glance at the <i>first</i> of these classes,
presupposing that they were cradled in the lap
of indulgence, and trained to science and virtue.</p>

<p>“If these people take to the streets, they become,
with here and there an exception, the
most reprobate and the least reclaimable. I was
once the inmate of a lodging-house, in which
there were at one time five University-men,
three surgeons, and several sorts of broken-down
clerks, or of other professional men. Their general
habits were demoralised to the last degree&mdash;their
oaths more horrid, extravagant, and far-fetched
than anything I ever heard: they were
stupid in logic, but very original in obscenity.
Most of them scoffed at the Bible, or perverted
its passages to extenuate fraud, to justify violence,
or construct for themselves excuses for
incontinence and imposition. It will appear
strange that these educated persons, when they
turn out upon the street, generally sell articles
which have no connection with literature, and
very little with art. The two brothers, who sell
that wonder-working paste which removes grease
from the outside of your collar by driving it
further in, were both scholars of Christ’s Hospital.
They were second Grecians, and might
have gone to college; but several visits to suburban
fairs, and their accompanying scenes of
debauch, gave them a <i>penchant</i> for a vagabond
life, and they will probably never relinquish it.
The very tall man&mdash;there are several others&mdash;who
sells razors and paste on a red pagoda-looking
stall, was apprenticed to a surgeon in Colchester,
with a premium of 300 guineas; and
the little dark-visaged man, who sells children’s
money-boxes and traps to catch vermin, is the
son of a late upholsterer in Bath, who was also
a magistrate of that city. The poor man alluded
to was a law-student, and kept two terms in
Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Many similar cases
might be mentioned&mdash;cases founded on real
observation and experience. Some light may be
thrown upon this subject by pointing out the
<i>modus operandi</i> by which a friend of mine got
initiated into the ‘art and mystery of patterism.’
‘I had lived,’ he said, ‘more than a year among
the tradesmen and tramps, who herd promiscuously
together in low lodging-houses. One
afternoon I was taking tea at the same table
with a brace of patterers. They eyed me with
suspicion; but, determined to know their proceedings,
I launched out the only cant word I
had then learned. They spoke of going to
Chatham. Of course, I knew the place, and
asked them, “Where do you stall to in the
huey?” which, fairly translated, means, “Where
do you lodge in the town?” Convinced that I
was “fly,” one of them said, “We drop the main
toper (go off the main road) and slink into
the crib (house) in the back drum (street).”
After some altercation with the “mot” of the
“ken” (mistress of the lodging-house) about the
cleanliness of a knife or fork, my new acquaintance
began to arrange “ground,” &amp;c., for the
night’s work. I got into their confidence by
degrees; and I give below a vocabulary of their
talk to each other:’</p>

<p>“The cant or slang of the patterer is not the
cant of the costermonger, but a system of their
own. As in the case of the costers, it is so
interlarded with their general remarks, while
their ordinary language is so smothered and
subdued, that unless when they are professionally
engaged and talking of their wares, they
might almost pass for foreigners.</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt,” continues my
informant, “that the <i>second</i> class of street-patterers,
to whom nature, or parents, or circumstances
have been unpropitious, are the
most moral, and have a greater sense of right
and wrong, with a quicksightedness about humane
and generous things, to which the ‘aristocratic’
patterer is a stranger. Of the dealers
in useful or harmless wares&mdash;although, of course,
they use allowable exaggeration as to the goodness
of the article&mdash;many are devout communicants
at church, or members of dissenting bodies;
while others are as careless about religion, and
are still to be found once or twice a week in the
lecture-rooms of the Mechanics’ Institute nearest
to their residence. Orchard-street, Westminster,
is a great locality for this sort of patterers.
Three well-known characters,&mdash;Bristol George,
Corporal Casey, and Jemmy the Rake, with a
very respectable and highly-informed man called
‘Grocer,’ from his having been apprenticed to
that business,&mdash;have maintained a character for
great integrity among the neighbours for many
years.</p>

<p>“I come now to the <i>third</i> class of patterers,&mdash;those
who, whatever their early pursuits and
pleasures, have manifested a predilection for
vagrancy, and neither can nor will settle to any
ordinary calling. There is now on the streets a
man scarcely thirty years old, conspicuous by
the misfortune of a sabre-wound on the cheek.
He is a native of the Isle of Man. His father
was a captain in the Buffs, and himself a commissioned
officer at seventeen. He left the
army, designing to marry and open a boarding-school.
The young lady to whom he was betrothed
died, and <i>that</i> event <i>might</i> affect his
mind; at any rate, he has had 38 situations
in a dozen years, and will not keep one a
week. He has a mortal antipathy to good
clothes, and will not keep them one hour.
He sells anything&mdash;chiefly needle-cases. He
‘patters’ very little in a <i>main drag</i> (public
street); but in the little private streets he
preaches an outline of his life, and makes no
secret of his wandering propensity. His aged
mother, who still lives, pays his lodgings in Old
Pye-street.</p>

<p>“From the hasty glance I have taken at the
patterers, any well-constructed mind may deduce
the following inference: although a great
amount of intelligence sometimes consists with
a great want of principle, that an utter want of education, or
<i>mis</i>-education, leaves man, like a reed floating
on the stream of time, to follow every direction
which the current of affairs may give him.</p>

<p>“There is yet another and a larger class, who
are wanderers from choice,&mdash;who would rather be
street-orators, and quacks, and performers, than
anything else in the world. In nine cases out
of ten, the street-patterers are persons of intemperate
habits, no veracity, and destitute of any
desire to improve their condition, even where
they have the chance. One of this crew was
lately engaged at a bazaar; he had 18<i>s.</i> a week,
and his only work was to walk up and down
and extol the articles exhibited. This was too
monotonous a life; I happened to pass him by
as he was taking his wages for the week, and
heard him say, ‘I shall cut this b&mdash;y work; I
can earn more on the streets, and be my own
master.’”</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to suppose that the
patterers, although a vagrant, are a disorganized
class. There is a telegraphic dispatch between
them, through the length and breadth of the
land. If two patterers (previously unacquainted)
meet in the provinces, the following,
or something like it, will be their conversation:&mdash;“Can
you ‘voker romeny’ (can you speak
cant)? What is your ‘monekeer’ (name)?”&mdash;Perhaps
it turns out that one is “White-headed
Bob,” and the other “Plymouth Ned.”
They have a “shant of gatter” (pot of beer) at
the nearest “boozing ken” (ale-house), and
swear eternal friendship to each other. The old
saying, that “When the liquor is in, the wit is
out,” is remarkably fulfilled on these occasions,
for they betray to the “flatties” (natives)
all their profits and proceedings.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that, in country districts,
where there are no streets, the patterer is obliged
to call at the houses. As they are mostly
without the hawker’s licence, and sometimes
find wet linen before it is lost, the rural districts
are not fond of their visits; and there are generally
two or three persons in a village reported
to be “gammy,” that is (unfavourable). If a
patterer has been “crabbed,” that is (offended)
at any of the “cribbs” (houses), he mostly
chalks a signal on or near the door. I give one
or two instances:</p>

<p><img src="images/0439a.png" class="inline" alt="diamond" /> “Bone,” meaning good.</p>

<p><img src="images/0439b.png" class="inline" alt="triangle, point down" /> “Cooper’d,” spoiled by the imprudence
of some other patterer.</p>

<p><img src="images/0439c.png" class="inline" alt="square" /> “Gammy,” likely to have you taken up.</p>

<p><img src="images/0439d.png" class="inline" alt="circle with dot" /> “Flummuxed,” sure of a month in quod.</p>

<p>In most lodging-houses there is an old man
who is the guide to every “walk” in the
vicinity, and who can tell every house, on every
round, that is “good for a cold ’tater.” In
many cases there is over the kitchen mantle-piece
a map of the district, dotted here and
there with memorandums of failure or success.</p>

<p>Patterers are fond of carving their names and
avocations about the houses they visit. The
old jail at Dartford has been some years a
“padding-ken.” In one of the rooms appears
the following autographs:</p>

<p>“Jemmy, the Rake, bound to Bristol; bad
beds, but no bugs. Thank God for all things.”</p>

<p>“Razor George and his moll slept here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
day afore Christmas; just out of ‘stir’ (jail),
for ‘muzzling a peeler.’”</p>

<p>“Scotch Mary, with ‘driz’ (lace), bound to
Dover and back, please God.”</p>

<p>Sometimes these inscriptions are coarse and
obscene; sometimes very well written and
orderly. Nor do they want illustrations.</p>

<p>At the old factory, Lincoln, is a portrait of
the town beadle, formerly a soldier; it is drawn
with different-coloured chalks, and ends with
the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“You are a B for false swearing,</div>
       <div class="verse">In hell they’ll roast you like a herring.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Concubinage is very common among patterers,
especially on their travels; they have
their regular rounds, and call the peregrination
“going on circuit.” For the most part they
are early risers; this gives them a facility for
meeting poor girls who have had a night’s
shelter in the union workhouses. They offer
such girls some refreshment,&mdash;swear they are
single men,&mdash;and promise comforts certainly
superior to the immediate position of their
victims. Consent is generally obtained; perhaps
a girl of 14 or 15, previously virtuous, is
induced to believe in a promise of constant protection,
but finds herself, the next morning,
ruined and deserted; nor is it unlikely that,
within a month or two, she will see her seducer
in the company of a dozen incidental wives. A
gray-headed miscreant called “Cutler Tom”
boasts of 500 such exploits; and there is too
great reason to believe that the picture of his
own drawing is not greatly overcharged.</p>

<p>Some of the patterers are married men, but
of this class very few are faithful to the solemn
obligation. I have heard of a renowned patterer
of this class who was married to four
women, and had lived in criminal intercourse
with his own sister, and his own daughter by
one of the wives. This sad rule has, however,
I am happy to state, some splendid exceptions.
There is a man called “Andy”&mdash;well known as
the companion of “Hopping Ned;” this “Andy”
has a wife of great personal attractions, a splendid
figure, and teeth without a parallel. She is
a strictly-virtuous woman, a most devoted wife,
and tender mother; very charitable to any one
in want of a meal, and very constant (she is a
Catholic) in her religious duties. Another man
of the same school, whose name has escaped me,
is, with his wife, an exception to the stigma on
almost the whole class; the couple in question
have no children. The wife, whose name is
Maria, has been in every hospital for some complaint
in her knees, probably white swelling:
her beauty is the theme of applause, and whenever
she opens her mouth silence pervades the
“paddin’ ken.” Her common conversation is
music and mathematics combined, her reading
has been masculine and extensive, and the
whisper of calumny has never yet attacked her
own demeanour or her husband’s.</p>

<p>Of patterers who have children, many are
very exemplary; sending them to Day and Sunday-schools,
causing them to say grace before
and after meals, to attend public worship, and
always to speak the truth: these, instances, however,
stand in fearful contrast with the conduct
of other parents.</p>

<p>“I have seen,” proceeds my reverend informant,
“fathers and mothers place their boys
and girls in positions of incipient enormity, and
command them to use language and gestures to
each other, which would make an harlot blush,
and almost a heathen tremble. I have hitherto
viewed the patterer as a salesman,&mdash;having
something in his hand, on whose merits, real or
pretended, he talks people out of their money.
By slow degrees prosperity rises, but rapid is
the advance of evil. The patterer sometimes
gets ‘out of stock,’ and is obliged, at no great
sacrifice of conscience, to ‘patter’ in another
strain. In every large town sham official documents,
with crests, seals, and signatures, can be
got for half-a-crown. Armed with these, the
patterer becomes a ‘lurker,’&mdash;that is, an impostor;
his papers certify any and every ‘ill
that flesh is heir to.’ Shipwreck is called a
‘shake lurk;’ loss by fire is a ‘glim.’ Sometimes
the petitioner has had a horse, which has
dropped dead with the mad staggers; or has a
wife ill or dying, and six or seven children at
once sickening of the small-pox. Children are
borrowed to support the appearance; the case
is certified by the minister and churchwardens
of a parish which exists only in imagination;
and as many people dislike the trouble of investigation,
the patterer gets enough to raise a
stock in trade, and divides the spoil between the
swag-shop and the gin-palace. Sometimes they
are detected, and get a ‘drag’ (three months in
prison). They have many narrow escapes: one
occurs to me, of a somewhat ludicrous character.
A patterer and lurker (now dead) known by the
name of ‘Captain Moody,’ unable to get a ‘fakement’
written or printed, was standing almost
naked in the streets of a neighbouring town.
A gentleman stood still and heard his piteous
tale, but having been ‘done’ more than once,
he resolved to examine the affair, and begged the
petitioner to conduct him to his wife and children,
who were in a garret on a bed of languishing,
with neither clothes, food, nor fire, but, it
appeared, with faith enough to expect a supply
from ‘Him who feedeth the ravens,’ and in
whose sacred name even a cold ’tater was implored.
The patterer, or half-patterer and half-beggar,
took the gentleman (who promised a
sovereign if every thing was square) through
innumerable and intricate windings, till he came
to an outhouse or sort of stable. He saw the
key outside the door, and begged the gentleman
to enter and wait till he borrowed a light of a
neighbour, to show him up-stairs. The illumination
never arrived, and the poor charitable
man found that the miscreant had locked him
into the stable. The patterer went to the padding-ken,&mdash;told
the story with great glee, and
left that locality within an hour of the occurrence.”</p>

<p>[Concerning the mendicancy and vagrancy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
patterers, I shall have more to say when I speak
of vagrancy in general, and when I describe the
general state and characteristics of the low lodging-houses
in London, and those in the country,
which are in intimate connection with the metropolitan
abodes of the vagrant. My present
theme is the London patterer, who is also a
street-seller.]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Publishers and Authors of
Street-Literature.</span></h3>

<p>The best known, and the most successful printer
and publisher of all who have directed their
industry to supply the “paper” in demand for
street sale, and in every department of street
literature, was the late “Jemmy Catnach,” who
is said to have amassed upwards of 10,000<i>l.</i> in
the business. He is reported to have made the
greater part of this sum during the trial of
Queen Caroline, by the sale of whole-sheet
“papers,” descriptive of the trial, and embellished
with “splendid illustrations.” The next
to Catnach stood the late “Tommy Pitt,” of the
noted toy and marble-warehouse. These two
parties were the Colburn and Bentley of the
“paper” trade. Catnach retired from business
some years ago, and resided in a country-house
at Barnet, but he did not long survive his retirement.
“He was an out and out sort,” said one
old paper-worker to me, “and if he knew you&mdash;and
he could judge according to the school you
belonged to, if he hadn’t known you long&mdash;he
was friendly for a bob or two, and sometimes
for a glass. He knew the men that was stickers
though, and there was no glass for them. Why,
some of his customers, sir, would have stuck to
him long enough, if there’d been a chance of
another glass&mdash;supposing they’d managed to get
<i>one</i>&mdash;and then would have asked him for a coach
home! When I called on him, he used to say,
in his north country way&mdash;he wasn’t Scotch,
but somewhere north of England&mdash;and he was
pleasant with it, ‘Well, d&mdash; you, how are you?’
He got the cream of the pail, sir.”</p>

<p>The present street literature printers and publishers
are, Mrs. Ryle (Catnach’s niece and
successor), Mr. Birt, and Mr. Paul (formerly
with Catnach), all of the Seven Dials; Mr.
Powell (formerly of Lloyd’s), Brick-lane, Whitechapel;
and Mr. Good, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell.
Mr. Phairs, of Westminster; Mr. Taylor,
of the Waterloo-road; and Mr. Sharp, of
Kent-street, Borough, have discontinued street
printing. One man greatly regretted Mr. Taylor’s
discontinuing the business; “he was so
handy for the New-cut, when it <i>was</i> the New-cut.”
Some classes of patterers, I may here
observe, work in “schools” or “mobs” of two,
three, or four, as I shall afterwards show.</p>

<p>The authors and poets who give its peculiar
literature, alike in prose or rhyme, to the streets,
are now six in number. They are all in some
capacity or other connected with street-patter or
song, and the way in which a narrative or a
“copy of werses” is prepared for press is usually
this:&mdash;The leading members of the “schools,”
some of whom refer regularly to the evening
papers, when they hear of any out-of-the-way
occurrence, resort to the printer and desire its
publication in a style proper for the streets.
This is usually done very speedily, the school
(or the majority of them) and the printer agreeing
upon the author. Sometimes an author
will voluntarily prepare a piece of street literature
and submit it to a publisher, who, as in
the case of other publishers, accepts or declines,
as he believes the production will or will not
prove remunerative. Sometimes the school
carry the manuscript with them to the printer,
and undertake to buy a certain quantity, to
insure publication. The payment to the author
is the same in all cases&mdash;a shilling.</p>

<p>Concerning the history and character of our
street and public-house literature, I shall treat
hereafter, when I can comprise the whole,
and after the descriptions of the several classes
engaged in the trade will have paved the way
for the reader’s better appreciation of the
curious and important theme. I say, <i>important</i>;
because the street-ballad and the street-narrative,
like all popular things, have their
influence on masses of the people. Specimens
will be found adduced, as I describe the several
classes, or in the statements of the patterers.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the street
author is closely restricted in the quality of his
effusion. It must be such as the patterers approve,
as the chaunters can chaunt, the ballad-singers
sing, and&mdash;above all&mdash;such as street-buyers
will buy. One chaunter, who was a great
admirer of the “Song of the Shirt,” told me
that if Hood himself had written the “Pitiful
Case of Georgy Sloan and his Wife,” it would
not have sold so well as a ballad he handed to
me, from which I extract a verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Jane Willbred we did starve and beat her very hard</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">I confess we used her very cruel,</div>
       <div class="verse">But now in a jail two long years we must bewail,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">We don’t fancy mustard in the gruel.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>What I have said of the <i>necessity</i> which controls
street authorship, may also be said of the
art which is sometimes called in to illustrate it.</p>

<p>The paper now published for the streets is
classed as quarter sheets, which cost (wholesale)
1<i>s.</i> a gross; half sheets, which cost 2<i>s.</i>; and
whole or broad sheets (such as for executions),
which cost 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a gross the first day, and 3<i>s.</i>
the next day or two, and afterwards, but only if
a ream be taken, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a ream contains forty
dozen. When “illustrated,” the charge is from
3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per ream extra. The books, for such
cases as the Sloanes, or the murder of Jael
Denny, are given in books&mdash;which are best
adapted for the suburban and country trade,
when London is “worked” sufficiently&mdash;are the
“whole sheet” printed so as to fold into eight
pages, each side of the paper being then, of
course, printed upon. A book is charged from
6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> extra (to a whole sheet) per gross, and
afterwards the same extra per ream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Long Song-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>I have this week given a daguerreotype of a
well-known long-song seller, and have preferred
to give it as the trade, especially as regards
London, has all but disappeared, and it was
curious enough. “Long songs” first appeared
between nine and ten years ago.</p>

<p>The long-song sellers did not depend upon
patter&mdash;though some of them pattered a little&mdash;to
attract customers, but on the veritable cheapness
and novel form in which they vended
popular songs, printed on paper rather wider
than this page, “three songs abreast,” and the
paper was about a yard long, which constituted
the “three” yards of song. Sometimes
three slips were pasted together. The
vendors paraded the streets with their “three
yards of new and popular songs” for a penny.
The songs are, or were, generally fixed to the
top of a long pole, and the vendor “cried”
the different titles as he went along. This
branch of “the profession” is confined solely
to the summer; the hands in winter usually
taking to the sale of song-books, it being impossible
to exhibit “the three yards” in wet or
foggy weather. The paper songs, as they fluttered
from a pole, looked at a little distance
like huge much-soiled white ribbons, used as
streamers to celebrate some auspicious news.
The cry of one man, in a sort of recitative, or,
as I heard it called by street-patterers, “sing-song,”
was, “Three yards a penny! Three yards
a penny! Beautiful songs! Newest songs!
Popular Songs! Three yards a penny! Song,
song, songs!” Others, however, were generally
content to announce merely “Three yards
a penny!” One cried “Two under fifty a fardy!”
As if two hundred and fifty songs were to be sold
for a farthing. The whole number of songs was
about 45. They were afterwards sold at a
halfpenny, but were shorter and fewer. It is
probable that at the best had the songs been
subjected to the admeasurement of a jury, the
result might have been as little satisfactory as
to some tradesmen who, however, after having
been detected in attempts to cheat the poor in
weights and scales, and to cheat them hourly,
are still “good men and true” enough to
be jurymen and parliamentary electors. The
songs, I am informed, were often about 2&frac12; yards,
(not as to paper but as to admeasurement of
type); 3 yards, occasionally, at first, and not
often less than 2 yards.</p>

<p>The crying of the titles was not done with
any other design than that of expressing the
great number of songs purchasable for “the
small charge of one penny.” Some of the
patterers I conversed with would have made it
sufficiently droll. One man told me that he
had cried the following songs in his three yards,
and he believed in something like the following
order, but he had cried penny song books,
among other things, lately, and might confound
his more ancient and recent cries:</p>

<p>“I sometimes began,” he said, “with singing,
or trying to sing, for I’m no vocalist, the
first few words of any song, and them quite
loud. I’d begin</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘The Pope he leads a happy life,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">He knows no care’&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Buffalo gals, come out to-night;’ ‘Death of
Nelson;’ ‘The gay cavalier;’ ‘Jim along
Josey;’ ‘There’s a good time coming;’
‘Drink to me only;’ ‘Kate Kearney;’
‘Chuckaroo-choo, choo-choo-choot-lah;’
‘Chockala-roony-ninkaping-nang;’ ‘Paga-daway-dusty-kanty-key;’
‘Hottypie-gunnypo-china-coo’
(that’s a Chinese song, sir); ‘I
dreamed that I dwelt in marble halls;’ ‘The
standard bearer;’ ‘Just like love;’ ‘Whistle
o’er the lave o’t;’ ‘Widow Mackree;’ ‘I’ve
been roaming;’ ‘Oh! that kiss;’ ‘The old
English gentleman,’ &amp;c., &amp;c. &amp;c. I dares say
they was all in the three yards, or was once, and
if they wasn’t there was others as good.”</p>

<p>The chief purchasers of the “long songs”
were boys and girls, but mostly boys, who expended
1<i>d.</i> or &frac12;<i>d.</i> for the curiosity and novelty
of the thing, as the songs were not in the most
readable form. A few working people bought
them for their children, and some women of the
town, who often buy anything fantastic, were
also customers.</p>

<p>When “the three yards was at their best,”
the number selling them was about 170; the
wholesale charge is from 3<i>d.</i> to 5<i>d.</i> a dozen,
according to size. The profit of the vendors in
the first instance was about 8<i>d.</i> a dozen. When
the trade had all the attractions of novelty,
some men sold ten dozen on fine days, and for
three or four of the summer months; so clearing
between 6<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> a day. This, however,
was not an average, but an average might be
at first 21<i>s.</i> a week profit. I am assured that
if twenty persons were selling long songs in the
street last summer it was “the outside,” as
long songs are now “for fairs and races and
country work.” Calculating that each cleared
9<i>s.</i> in a week, and to clear that took 15<i>s.</i>, the
profit being smaller than it used to be, as
many must be sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each&mdash;we find 120<i>l.</i>
expended in long songs in the streets. The
character of the vendor is that of a patterer of
inferior genius.</p>

<p>The stock-money required is 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>; which
with 2<i>d.</i> for a pole, and &frac12;<i>d.</i> for paste, is all
the capital needed. Very few were sold in
the public-houses, as the vendors scrupled to
expose them there, “for drunken fellows would
snatch them, and make belts of them for a
lark.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Running Patterers.</span></h3>

<p>Few of the residents in London&mdash;but chiefly
those in the quieter streets&mdash;have not been
aroused, and most frequently in the evening, by
a hurly-burly on each side of the street. An
attentive listening will not lead any one to an
accurate knowledge of what the clamour is
about. It is from a “mob” or “school” of
the running patterers (for both those words are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
used), and consists of two, three, or four men.
All these men state that the greater the noise
they make, the better is the chance of sale, and
better still when the noise is on each side of a
street, for it appears as if the vendors were
proclaiming such interesting or important intelligence,
that they were vieing with one another
who should supply the demand which must
ensue. It is not possible to ascertain with any
certitude <i>what</i> the patterers are so anxious to
sell, for only a few leading words are audible.
One of the cleverest of running patterers repeated
to me, in a subdued tone, his announcements
of murders. The words “Murder,”
“Horrible,” “Barbarous,” “Love,” “Mysterious,”
“Former Crimes,” and the like,
could only be caught by the ear, but there
was no announcement of anything like “particulars.”
If, however, the “paper” relate
to any well-known criminal, such as Rush,
the name is given distinctly enough, and so
is any new or pretended fact. The running
patterers describe, or profess to describe, the
contents of their papers as they go rapidly
along, and they seldom or ever stand still.
They usually deal in murders, seductions,
crim.-cons., explosions, alarming accidents,
“assassinations,” deaths of public characters,
duels, and love-letters. But popular, or notorious,
murders are the “great goes.” The
running patterer cares less than other street-sellers
for bad weather, for if he “work” on
a wet and gloomy evening, and if the work be
“a cock,” which is a fictitious statement or
even a pretended fictitious statement, there is
the less chance of any one detecting the <i>ruse</i>.
But of late years no new “cocks” have
been printed, excepting for temporary purposes,
such as I have specified as under its
appropriate head in my account of “Death
and Fire-Hunters.” Among the old stereotyped
“cocks” are love-letters. One is well
known as “The Husband caught in a Trap,”
and being in an epistolary form subserves any
purpose: whether it be the patterer’s aim to
sell the “Love Letters” of any well-known
person, such as Lola Montes, or to fit them
for a local (pretended) scandal, as the “Letters
from a Lady in this neighbourhood to a
Gentleman not 100 miles off.”</p>

<p>Of running patterers there are now in London
from 80 to 100. They reside&mdash;some in their
own rooms, but the majority in lodging-houses&mdash;in
or near Westminster, St Giles’s, Whitechapel,
Stratford, Deptford, Wandsworth, and
the Seven Dials. The “Dials,” however, is
their chief locality, being the residence of the
longest-established printers, and is the “head
meet” of the fraternity.</p>

<p>It is not easy to specify with exactitude the
number of running or flying patterers at any
one time in London. Some of these men become,
occasionally, standing patterers, chaunters, or
ballad-singers&mdash;classes I shall subsequently describe&mdash;and
all of them resort at intervals to
country rounds. I heard, also, many complaints
of boys having of late “taken to the running
patter” when anything attractive was before the
public, and of ignorant fellows&mdash;that wouldn’t
have thought of it at one time&mdash;“trying their
hands at it.” Waiving these exceptional augmentations
of the number, I will take the body
of running patterers, generally employed in their
peculiar craft in London, at 90. To ascertain
their earnings presents about the same difficulties
as to ascertain their number; for as all they
earn is spent&mdash;no patterer ever saving money&mdash;they
themselves are hardly able to tell their
incomes. If any new and exciting fact be before
the public, these men may each clear 20<i>s.</i> a
week; when there is no such fact, they may not
earn 5<i>s.</i> The profit is contingent, moreover, upon
their being able to obtain 1<i>d.</i>, or only &frac12;<i>d.</i>, for
their paper. Some represented their average
weekly earnings at 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the year through;
some at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and others at less than half of
12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Reckoning, however, that only 9<i>s.</i>
weekly is an average profit per individual, and
that 14<i>s.</i> be taken to realise that profit, we find
3,276<i>l.</i> expended yearly on running patterers in
London; but in that sum the takings of the
chaunters must be included, as they are members
of the same fraternity, and work with the
patterers.</p>

<p>The capital required to commence as a running
patterer is but the price of a few papers&mdash;from
2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> The men have no distinctive dress:
“our togs,” said one of them, “is in the latest
fashion of Petticoat-lane;” unless on the very
rare occasions, when some character has to be
personated, and then coloured papers and glazed
calicoes are made available. But this is only a
venture of the old hands.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experience of a Running Patterer.</span></h3>

<p>From a running patterer, who has been
familiar with the trade for many years, I
received, upwards of a twelvemonth ago, the
following statement. He is well known for his
humour, and is a leading man in his fraternity.
After some conversation about “cocks,” the
most popular of which, my informant said, was
the murder at Chigwell-row, he continued:</p>

<p>“That’s a trump, to the present day. Why,
I’d go out now, sir, with a dozen of Chigwell-rows,
and earn my supper in half an hour off of
’em. The murder of Sarah Holmes at Lincoln
is good, too&mdash;that there has been worked for the
last five year successively every winter. Poor
Sarah Holmes! Bless her! she has saved me
from walking the streets all night many a time.
Some of the best of these have been in work
twenty years&mdash;the Scarborough murder has full
twenty years. It’s called ‘<span class="smcap">The Scarborough
Tragedy</span>.’ I’ve worked it myself. It’s about
a noble and rich young naval officer seducing a
poor clergyman’s daughter. She is confined in
a ditch, and destroys the child. She is taken up
for it, tried, and executed. This has had a great
run. It sells all round the country places, and
would sell now if they had it out. Mostly all
our customers is females. They are the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
dependence we have. The Scarborough Tragedy
is very attractive. It draws tears to the
women’s eyes to think that a poor clergyman’s
daughter, who is remarkably beautiful, should
murder her own child; it’s very touching to
every feeling heart. There’s a copy of verses
with it, too. Then there’s the Liverpool Tragedy&mdash;that’s
very attractive. It’s a mother
murdering her own son, through gold. He had
come from the East Indies, and married a rich
planter’s daughter. He came back to England
to see his parents after an absence of thirty
years. They kept a lodging-house in Liverpool
for sailors; the son went there to lodge, and
meant to tell his parents who he was in the
morning. His mother saw the gold he had got
in his boxes, and cut his throat&mdash;severed his
head from his body; the old man, upwards of
seventy years of age, holding the candle. They
had put a washing-tub under the bed to catch his
blood. The morning after the murder, the old
man’s daughter calls and inquires for a young
man. The old man denies that they have had
any such person in the house. She says he had
a mole on his arm, in the shape of a strawberry.
The old couple go up-stairs to examine the
corpse, and find they have murdered their own
son, and then they both put an end to their
existence. This is a deeper tragedy than the
Scarborough Murder. That suits young people
better; they like to hear about the young woman
being seduced by the naval officer; but the
mothers take more to the Liverpool Tragedy&mdash;it
suits them better. Some of the ‘cocks’ were
in existence long before ever I was born or
thought of. The ‘Great and important battle
between the two young ladies of fortune,’ is
what we calls ‘a ripper.’ I should like to have
that there put down correct,” he added, “’cause
I’ve taken a tidy lot of money out of it.”</p>

<p>My informant, who had been upwards of
20 years in the running patter line, told me
that he commenced his career with the “Last
Dying Speech and Full Confession of William
Corder.” He was sixteen years of age,
and had run away from his parents. “I
worked that there,” he said, “down in the very
town (at Bury) where he was executed. I
got a whole hatful of halfpence at that.
Why, I wouldn’t even give ’em seven for sixpence&mdash;no,
that I wouldn’t. A gentleman’s
servant come out and wanted half a dozen
for his master and one for himself in, and I
wouldn’t let him have no such thing. We often
sells more than that at once. Why, I sold six
at one go to the railway clerks at Norwich about
the Manning affair, only a fortnight back. But
Steinburgh’s little job&mdash;you know he murdered
his wife and family, and committed suicide after&mdash;that
sold as well as any ‘die.’ Pegsworth
was an out-and-out lot. I did tremendous with
him, because it happened in London, down Ratcliff-highway&mdash;that’s
a splendid quarter for
working&mdash;there’s plenty of feelings&mdash;but, bless
you, some places you go to you can’t move no
how, they’ve hearts like paving-stones. They
wouldn’t have ‘the papers’ if you’d give them
to ’em&mdash;especially when they knows you.
Greenacre didn’t sell so well as might have
been expected, for such a diabolical out-and-out
crime as he committed; but you see he came
close after Pegsworth, and that took the beauty
off him. Two murderers together is never no
good to nobody. Why there was Wilson Gleeson,
as great a villain as ever lived&mdash;went and
murdered a whole family at noon-day&mdash;but
Rush coopered him&mdash;and likewise that girl at
Bristol&mdash;made it no draw to any one. Daniel
Good, though, was a first-rater; and would
have been much better if it hadn’t been for that
there Madam Toosow. You see, she went down to
Roehampton, and guv 2<i>l.</i> for the werry clogs as
he used to wash his master’s carriage in; so, in
course, when the harristocracy could go and see
the real things&mdash;the werry identical clogs&mdash;in
the Chamber of ’Orrors, why the people wouldn’t
look at our authentic portraits of the fiend in
human form. Hocker wasn’t any particular
great shakes. There was a deal expected from
him, but he didn’t turn out well. Courvoisier
was much better; he sold wery well, but nothing
to Blakesley. Why I worked him for six weeks.
The wife of the murdered man kept the King’s
Head that he was landlord on open on the morning
of the execution, and the place was like a
fair. I even went and sold papers outside the
door myself. I thought if she war’n’t ashamed,
why should I be? After that we had a fine
‘fake’&mdash;that was the fire of the Tower of London&mdash;it
sold rattling. Why we had about forty
apprehended for that&mdash;first we said two soldiers
was taken up that couldn’t obtain their discharge,
and then we declared it was a well-known
sporting nobleman who did it for a spree.
The boy Jones in the Palace wasn’t much
of an affair for the running patterers; the
ballad singers&mdash;or street screamers, as we calls
’em&mdash;had the pull out of that. The patter
wouldn’t take; they had read it all in the newspapers
before. Oxford, and Francis, and Bean
were a little better, but nothing to crack about.
The people doesn’t care about such things as
them. There’s nothing beats a stunning good
murder, after all. Why there was Rush&mdash;I
lived on him for a month or more. When I commenced
with Rush, I was 14<i>s.</i> in debt for rent,
and in less than fourteen days I astonished the
wise men in the east by paying my landlord all
I owed him. Since Dan’el Good there had
been little or nothing doing in the murder line&mdash;no
one could cap him&mdash;till Rush turned up a
regular trump for us. Why I went down to
Norwich expressly to work the execution. I
worked my way down there with ‘<i>a sorrowful
lamentation</i>’ of his own composing, which I’d
got written by the blind man expressly for the
occasion. On the morning of the execution we
beat all the regular newspapers out of the field;
for we had the full, true, and particular account
down, you see, by our own express, and that can
beat anything that ever they can publish; for
we gets it printed several days afore it comes off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and goes and stands with it right under the drop;
and many’s the penny I’ve turned away when
I’ve been asked for an account of the whole
business <i>before</i> it happened. So you see, for
herly and correct hinformation, we can beat the
<i>Sun</i>&mdash;aye, or the moon either, for the matter of
that. Irish Jem, the Ambassador, never goes to
bed but he blesses Rush the farmer; and many’s
the time he’s told me we should never have such
another windfall as that. But I told him not to
despair; there’s a good time coming, boys, says
I, and, sure enough, up comes the Bermondsey
tragedy. We might have done very well, indeed,
out of the Mannings, but there was too many
examinations for it to be any great account
to us. I’ve been away with the Mannings in
the country ever since. I’ve been through Hertfordshire,
Cambridgeshire, and Suffolk, along
with George Frederick Manning and his wife&mdash;travelled
from 800 to 1,000 miles with ’em, but
I could have done much better if I had stopped
in London. Every day I was anxiously looking
for a confession from Mrs. Manning. All I
wanted was for her to clear her conscience afore
she left this here whale of tears (that’s what I
always calls it in the patter), and when I read
in the papers (mind they was none of my own)
that her last words on the brink of heternity
was, ‘I’ve nothing to say to you, Mr. Rowe, but
to thank you for your kindness,’ I guv her up
entirely&mdash;had completely done with her. In
course the public looks to us for the last words
of all monsters in human form, and as for Mrs.
Manning’s, they were not worth the printing.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Recent Experience of a Running
Patterer.</span></h3>

<p>From the same man I had the following account
of his vocation up to the present time:</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said, “I think, take them
altogether, things hasn’t been so good this
last year as the year before. But the Pope,
God bless him! he’s been the best friend I’ve
had since Rush, but Rush licked his Holiness.
You see, the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman is a
one-sided affair; of course the Catholics won’t
buy anything against the Pope, but <i>all</i> religions
could go for Rush. Our mob once thought of
starting a cardinal’s dress, and I thought of
wearing a red hat myself. I did wear a shovel
hat when the Bishop of London was our racket;
but I thought the hat began to feel too hot, so I
shovelled it off. There was plenty of paper
that would have suited to work with a cardinal’s
hat. There was one,&mdash;‘Cardinal Wiseman’s
Lament,’&mdash;and it was giving his own words
like, and a red hat would have capped it. It
used to make the people roar when it came to
snivelling, and grumbling at little Jack Russell&mdash;by
Wiseman, in course; and when it comes
to this part&mdash;which alludes to that ’ere thundering
letter to the Bishop of Durham&mdash;the
people was stunned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘He called me a buffalo, bull, and a monkey,</div>
       <div class="verse">And then with a soldier called Old Arthur conkey</div>
       <div class="verse">Declared they would buy me a ninepenny donkey,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">And send me to Rome to the Pope.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“They shod me, sir. <i>Who’s</i> they? Why,
the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman. I call my
clothes after them I earn money by to buy
them with. My shoes I call Pope Pius; my
trowsers and braces, Calcraft; my waistcoat and
shirt, Jael Denny; and my coat, Love Letters.
A man must show a sense of gratitude in the
best way he can. But I didn’t start the cardinal’s
hat; I thought it might prove disagreeable
to Sir Robert Peel’s dress lodgers.” [What my
informant said further of the Pope, I give under
the head of the Chaunter.] “There was very
little doing,” he continued, “for some time
after I gave you an account before; hardly a
slum worth a crust and a pipe of tobacco to us.
A slum’s a paper fake,&mdash;make a foot-note of
that, sir. I think Adelaide was the first thing
I worked after I told you of my tomfooleries.
Yes it was,&mdash;her helegy. She weren’t of no
account whatsomever, and Cambridge was no
better nor Adelaide. But there was poor Sir
Robert Peel,&mdash;he <i>was</i> some good; indeed, I
think he was as good as 5<i>s.</i> a day to me for
the four or five days when he was freshest.
Browns were thrown out of the windows to us,
and one copper cartridge was sent flying at us
with 13&frac12;<i>d.</i> in it, all copper, as if it had been
collected. I worked Sir Robert at the West
End, and in the quiet streets and squares.
Certainly we had a most beautiful helegy.
Well, poor gentleman, what we earned on him
was some set-off to us for his starting his new
regiment of the Blues&mdash;the Cook’s Own. Not
that they’ve troubled me much. I was once
before Alderman Kelly, when he was Lord
Mayor, charged with obstructing, or some humbug
of that sort. ‘What are you, my man?’
says he quietly, and like a gentleman. ‘In the
same line as yourself, my lord,’ says I. ‘How’s
that?’ says he. ‘I’m a paper-worker for my
living, my lord,’ says I. I was soon discharged;
and there was such fun and laughing, that if
I’d had a few slums in my pocket, I believe I
could have sold them all in the justice-room.</p>

<p>“Haynau was a stunner, and the drayman
came their caper just in the critical time for us,
as things was growing very taper. But I did
best with him in chaunting; and so, as you
want to hear about chaunting, I’ll tell you
after. We’re forced to change our patter&mdash;first
running, then chaunting, and then standing&mdash;oftener
than we used to.</p>

<p>“Then Calcraft was pretty tidy browns. He
was up for starving his mother,&mdash;and what better
can you expect of a hangman? Me and my
mate worked him down at Hatfield, in Essex,
where his mother lives. It’s his native, I believe.
We sold her one. She’s a limping old body. I
saw the people look at her, and they told me
arterards who she was. ‘How much?’ says
she. ‘A penny, marm,’ say I. ‘Sarve him
right,’ says she. We worked it, too, in the
street in Hoxton where he lives, and he sent out
for two, which shows he’s a sensible sort of
character in some points, after all. Then we
had a ‘Woice from the Gaol! or the Horrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the Condemned Cell! Being the Life of
William Calcraft, the present Hangman.’ It’s
written in the high style, and parts of it will
have astonished the hangman’s nerves before
this. Here’s a bit of the patter, now:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let us look at William Calcraft,” says the eminent
author, “in his earliest days. He was born about the
year 1801, of humble but industrious parents, at a
little village in Essex. His infant ears often listened
to the children belonging to the Sunday schools of his
native place, singing the well-known words of Watt’s
beautiful hymn,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘When e’er I take my walks abroad,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">How many poor I see, &amp;c.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But alas for the poor farmer’s boy, he never had the
opportunity of going to that school to be taught how
to shun ‘the broad way leading to destruction.’ To
seek a chance fortune he travelled up to London
where his ignorance and folorn condition shortly
enabled that fell demon which ever haunts the footsteps
of the wretched, to mark him for her own.”</p></div>

<p>“Isn’t that stunning, sir? Here it is in print
for you. ‘Mark him for her own!’ Then, poor
dear, he’s so sorry to hang anybody. Here’s
another bit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘But in vain he repents, he has no real friend
in the world but his wife, to whom he can communicate
his private thoughts, and in return receive consolation,
can any lot be harder than this? Hence his
nervous system is fast breaking down, every day rendering
him less able to endure the excruciating and
agonizing torments he is hourly suffering, he is
haunted by remorse heaped upon remorse, every fresh
victim he is required to strangle being so much additional
fuel thrown upon that mental flame which is
scorching him.’</p></div>

<p>“You may believe me, sir, and I can prove
the fact&mdash;the author of that beautiful writing
ain’t in parliament! Think of the mental flame,
sir! O, dear.</p>

<p>“Sirrell was no good either. Not salt to a
herring. Though we worked him in his own
neighbourhood, and pattered about gold and
silver all in a row. ‘Ah!’ says one old
woman, ‘he was a ’spectable man.’ ‘Werry,
marm,’ says I.</p>

<p>“Hollest weren’t no good either, ’cause the
wictim was a parson. If it had happened a little
later, <i>we’d</i> have had it to rights; the newspapers
didn’t make much of it. We’d have
shown it was the ‘Commencement of a Most
Horrid and Barbarious Plot got up by the Pope
and Cardinal Wiseman <i>for-r</i> the Mas-ser-cree-ing
of all good Protestant Ministers.’ That would
have been the dodge, sir! A beautiful idear,
now, isn’t it? But the murder came off badly,
and you can’t expect fellows like them murderers
to have any regard for the interest of art and
literature. Then there’s so long to wait between
the murder and the trial, that unless the fiend
in human form keeps writing beautiful love-letters,
the excitement can’t be kept up. <i>We</i>
can write the love-letters for the fiend in human?
That’s quite true, and we once had a great pull
that way over the newspapers. But Lord love
you, there’s plenty of ’em gets more and more
into our line. They treads in our footsteps, sir;
they follows our bright example. O! isn’t
there a nice rubbing and polishing up. This
here copy won’t do. This must be left out, and
that put in; ’cause it suits the walk of the paper.
Why, you must know, sir. <i>I</i> know. Don’t tell
me. You can’t have been on the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> for nothing.</p>

<p>“Then there was the ‘Horrid and Inhuman
Murder, Committed by T. Drory, on the Body
of Jael Denny, at Donninghurst, a Village in
Essex.’ We worked it in every way. Drory
had every chance given to him. We had half-sheets,
and copies of werses, and books. A very
tidy book it was, setting off with showing how
‘The secluded village of Donninghurst has been
the scene of a most determined and diabolical
murder, the discovery of which early on Sunday,
the 12th, in the morning has thrown the
whole of this part of the country into a painful
state of excitement.’ Well, sir, well&mdash;very well;
that bit was taken from a newspaper. Oh,
we’re not above acknowledging when we condescends
to borrow from any of ’em. If you remember,
when I saw you about the time, I told
you I thought Jael Denny would turn out as
good as Maria Martin. And without any joke
or nonsense, sir, it really is a most shocking
thing. But she didn’t. The weather coopered
her, poor lass! There was money in sight, and
we couldn’t touch it; it seemed washed away
from us, for you may remember how wet it was.
I made a little by her, though. For all that, I
haven’t done with Master Drory yet. If God
spares my life, he shall make it up to me. Why,
now, sir, is it reasonable, that a poor man like
me should take so much pains to make Drory’s
name known all over the country, and walk
miles and miles in the rain to do it, and get only
a few bob for my labour? It can’t be thought
on. When the Wile and Inhuman Seducer
takes his trial, he must pay up my just claims.
I’m not going to take all that trouble on his
account, and let him off so easy.”</p>

<p>My informant then gave me an account of
his sale of papers relating to the Pope and
Cardinal Wiseman, but as he was then a
chaunter, rather than a patterer (the distinction
is shown under another head), I give his
characteristic account, as the statement of a
chaunter. He proceeded after having finished
his recital of the street business relating to the
Pope, &amp;c.:</p>

<p>“My last paying caper was the Sloanes.
They beat Haynau. I declare to you, sir, the
knowingest among us couldn’t have invented
a cock to equal the conduct of them Sloanes.
Why, it’s disgusting to come near the plain
truth about them. I think, take it altogether,
Sloane was as good as the Pope, but he had
a stopper like Pius the Ninth, for that was a
one-sided affair, and the Catholics wouldn’t
buy; and Sloane was too disgusting for the
gentry, or better sort, to buy him. But I’ve
been in little streets where some of the windows
was without sashes, and some that had sashes
had stockings thrust between the frames, and
I’ve taken half a bob in ha’pennies. Oh! you

him, for it was women that bought him most.
They was more savage against him than
against her. Why, they had fifty deaths for
him. Rolling in a barrel, with lots of sharp
nails inside, down Primrose-hill, and turned out
to the women on Kennington-common, and
boiled alive in oil or stuff that can’t be mentioned,
or hung over a slow fire. ‘O, the poor
dear girl,’ says they, ‘what she’s suffered.’
We had accounts of Mistress Sloane’s apprehension
before the papers. We had it at
Jersey, and they had it at Boulogne, but we
were first. Then we discovered, because we
<i>must</i> be in advance of the papers, that Miss
Devaux was Sloane’s daughter by a former
wife, and Jane Wilbred was Mrs. Sloane’s
daughter by a former husband, and was entitled
to 1,000<i>l.</i> by rights. Haynau was a fool to Sloane.</p>

<p>“I don’t know of anything fresh that’s in
hand, sir. One of our authors is coming out
with something spicy, against Lord John, for
doing nothing about Wiseman; ’cause he says
as no one thing that he’s written for Lord John
ever sold well, something against him may.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Chaunters.</span></h3>

<p>“As the minstrel’s art,” writes Mr. Strutt, in
his “Sports and Pastimes,” “consisted of several
branches, the professors were distinguished by
different denominations, as ‘rimours, <i>chanterres</i>,
conteours, jougleours or jongleurs, jestours, lecours,
and troubadours or trouvers:’ in modern
language, rhymers, singers, story-tellers, jugglers,
relaters of heroic actions, buffoons, and
poets; but all of them were included under the
general name of minstrel. An eminent French
antiquary says of the minstrels, that some of
them themselves composed the subjects they
sang or related, as the trouvers and the conteurs;
and some of them used the compositions
of others, as the jougleours and the chanteurs. He
further remarks, that the trouvers may be said
to have embellished their productions with
rhyme, while the conteurs related their histories
in prose; the jougleours, who in the middle ages
were famous for playing upon the vielle” [a
kind of hurdy-gurdy], “accompanied the songs
of the trouvers. These jougleours were also
assisted by the chanteurs; and this union of
talents rendered the compositions more harmonious
and more pleasing to the auditory, and
increased their rewards, so that they readily
joined each other, and travelled together in large
parties. It is, however, very certain that the
poet, the songster, and the musician were frequently
united in the same person.” My account
of the authors, &amp;c., of street literature
shows that the analogy still holds.</p>

<p>The French antiquary quoted was Fauchet,
in his “Origine de la Langue et Poësie Françoise”
(1581); and though he wrote concerning
his own country, his descriptions apply equally
to the English minstrels, who were principally
Normans, for many reigns after the Conquest,
and were of the same race, and habits, and
manners as on the French side of the Channel.</p>

<p>Of the minstrels, I shall have more to say
when I treat of the ballad-singers and the bands
of street and public-house musicians of to-day,
between whom and the minstrels of old there is,
in many respects, a somewhat close resemblance.
Minstrelsy fell gradually from its high estate,
and fell so low that, in the 39th year of Elizabeth’s
reign&mdash;a period when the noblest poetry
of any language was beginning to command the
ear of the educated in England&mdash;the minstrels
were classed in a penal statute with rogues,
vagabonds, and sturdy beggars! Putenham, in
his “Arte of English Poesie” (1589), speaks of
“taverne minstrels that give a fit of mirth for
a groat.” One of the statutes enacted in
Cromwell’s Protectorate was directed against
all persons “commonly called fidlers or minstrells.”</p>

<p>In the old times, then, the jougeleurs and
jestours were assisted by the chanteurs. In
the present day the running patterer&mdash;who, as I
have shown, is the sufficiently legitimate descendant
of the jestour, and in some respects of
the mountebank&mdash;is accompanied generally by
a chaunter, so presenting a further point of
resemblance between ancient and modern street-folk.
The chaunter now not only sings, but
fiddles, for within these few years the running
patterers, to render their performances
more attractive, are sometimes accompanied by
musicians. The running performer then, instead
of hurrying along with the members of his mob,
making sufficient noise to arouse a whole street,
takes his stand with the chaunter in any promising
place, and as the songs which are the most
popular are&mdash;as is the case at many of the
concert-rooms&mdash;sometimes “spoken” as well as
sung, the performers are in their proper capacity,
for the patterer not only “speaks,” but
speaks more than is set down for him, while the
chaunter fiddles and sings. Sometimes the one
patters while the other sings, and their themes
are the same.</p>

<p>I am told, however, that there are only fifty
running patterers who are regularly their own
chaunters, fiddling to their songs, while the mob
work as usual, or one man sings, or speaks and
sings, with the chaunter. Two of these men
are known as Brummagem Jack, and the
Country Paganini. From twenty to thirty patterers,
however, are chaunters also, when they
think the occasion requires it.</p>

<p>Further to elucidate chaunting, and to show
the quality of the canticles, and the way of proceeding,
I cite a statement of his experience as
a chaunter, from the running patterer, whose
details of his more especial business I have
already given, but who also occasionally
<span class="lock">chaunts:&mdash;</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Chaunter.</span></h3>

<p>“The Pope, sir,” he began, “was as one-sided
to chaunt as to patter, in course. We
had the Greeks (the lately-arrived Irish) down
upon us more than once. In Liverpool-street,
on the night of the meeting at Guildhall about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the Papal Aggression, we had a regular skrimmage.
One gentleman said: ‘Really, you
shouldn’t sing such improper songs, my men.’
Then up comes another, and he was a little
crusted with port wine, and he says: ‘What,
against that cove the Pope! Here, give me
half a dozen of the papers.’ The city was tidy
for the patter, sir, or the chaunt; there was
sixpences; but there was shillings at the West
End. And for the first time in their innocent
lives, the parsons came out as stunning patrons
of the patter. One of ’em as we was at work
in the street give a bit of a signal and was
attended to without any parade to the next
street, and was good for half-a-crown! Other
two stopped, that wery same day, and sent a
boy to us with a Joey. Then me and my mate
went to the Rev. W.’s, him as came it so strong
for the fire-works on the Fifth of November.
And we pattered and we pattered, and we
chaunted and we chaunted, but no go for a
goodish bit. His servant said he weren’t at
home. In course <i>that</i> wouldn’t do for us, so
down he came his-self at last, and says, werry
soft: ‘Come to-morrow morning, my men,
and there’ll be two gentlemen to hear you.’
We stuck to him for something in hand, but
he said the business had cost him so much
already, he really couldn’t. Well, we bounced
a bob out of him, and didn’t go near him again.
After all we did for his party, a shilling was
black ingratitude. Of course <i>we</i> has no feeling
either for or agin the Pope. <i>We</i> goes to it as
at an election; and let me tell you, sir, we got
very poorly paid, it couldn’t be called paid, for
working for Lord John at the City Election;
and I was the original of the live rats, which
took well. But there’s a good time coming to
pay Lord Johnny off.</p>

<p>“Some of the tunes&mdash;there’s no act of parliament
about tunes, you know, sir&mdash;was stunners
on the fiddle; as if a thousand bricks was
falling out of a cart at once. I think ‘The
Pope and Cardinal Wiseman,’ one of the first
of the songs, did as well as any. This werse
was greatly <span class="lock">admired:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Death and Fire Hunters.</span></h3>

<p>I have described the particular business of the
running patterer, who is known by another and
a very expressive cognomen&mdash;as a “Death
Hunter.” This title refers not only to his vending
accounts of all the murders that become
topics of public conversation, but to his being a
“murderer” on his own account, as in the sale
of “cocks” mentioned incidentally in this narrative.
If the truth be saleable, a running patterer
prefers selling the truth, for then&mdash;as one
man told me&mdash;he can “go the same round comfortably
another day.” If there be no truths
for sale&mdash;no stories of criminals’ lives and loves
to be condensed from the diffusive biographies
in the newspapers&mdash;no “helegy” for a great
man gone&mdash;no prophecy and no crim. con.&mdash;the
death hunter invents, or rather announces, them.
He puts some one to death for the occasion,
which is called “a cock.” The paper he sells
may give the dreadful details, or it may be a
religious tract, “brought out in mistake,”
should the vendor be questioned on the subject;
or else the poor fellow puts on a bewildered look
and murmurs, “O, it’s shocking to be done
this way&mdash;but I can’t read.” The patterers pass
along so rapidly that this detection rarely
happens.</p>

<p>One man told me that in the last eight or ten
years, he, either singly or with his “mob,” had
twice put the Duke of Wellington to death,
once by a fall from his horse, and the other time
by a “sudden and myst-<i>e</i>rious” death, without
any condescension to particulars. He had twice
performed the same mortal office for Louis
Phillipe, before that potentate’s departure from
France; each death was by the hands of an
assassin; “one was stabbing, and the other a
shot from a distance.” He once thought of
poisoning the Pope, but was afraid of the street
Irish. He broke Prince Albert’s leg, or arm,
(he was not sure which), when his royal highness
was out with his harriers. He never had
much to say about the Queen; “it wouldn’t
go down,” he thought, and perhaps nothing had
lately been said. “Stop, there, sir,” said another
patterer, of whom I inquired as to the correctness
of those statements, (after my constant
custom in sifting each subject thoroughly,)
“stop, stop, sir. I <i>have</i> had to say about the
Queen lately. In coorse, nothing can be said
against her, and nothing ought to; that’s true
enough, but the last time she was confined, I
cried her <i>accouchement</i> (the word was pronounced
as spelt to a merely English reader, or rather
more broadly) of <i>three</i>! Lord love you, sir, it
would have been no use crying <i>one</i>; people’s so
used to that; but a Bobby came up and he
stops me, and said it was some impudence about
the Queen’s <i>coachman</i>! Why look at it, says I,
fat-head&mdash;I knew I was safe&mdash;and see if there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
anything in it about the Queen or her coachman!
And he looked, and in coorse there was
nothing. I forget just now what the paper <i>was</i>
about.” My first-mentioned informant had apprehended
Feargus O’Connor on a charge of
high treason. He assassinated Louis Napoleon,
“from a <i>fourth</i> edition of the <i>Times</i>,” which
“did well.” He caused Marshal Haynau to
die of the assault by the draymen. He made
Rush hang himself in prison. He killed Jane
Wilbred, and put Mrs. Sloane to death; and
he announced the discovery that Jane Wilbred
was Mrs. Sloane’s daughter.</p>

<p>This informant did not represent that he had
originated these little pieces of intelligence, only
that he had been a party to their sale, and a
party to originating one or two. Another patterer&mdash;and
of a higher order of genius&mdash;told me that
all which was stated was undoubtedly correct,
“but me and my mates, sir,” he said, “did
Haynau in another style. A splendid slum,
sir! Capital! We assassinated him&mdash;<i>mys</i>-terious.
Then about Rush. His hanging hisself
in prison was a fake, I know; but we’ve had
him lately. His ghost appeared&mdash;as is shown in
the Australian papers&mdash;to Emily Sandford, and
threatened her; and took her by the neck, and
there’s the red marks of his fingers to be seen
on her neck to this day!” The same informant
was so loud in his praise of the “Ass-sass-sination”
of Haynau that I give the account. I
have little doubt it was his own writing. It is
confused in passages, and has a blending of the
“I” and the “we:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have just received upon undisputed authority,
that, that savage and unmanly tyrant, that enemy to
civil and religious liberty, the inhuman Haynau has
at last finished his career of guilt by the hand of an
assassin, the term assassin I have no doubt will greet
harshly upon the ears of some of our readers, yet never
the less I am compelled to use it although I would
gladly say the <i>average</i> of outraged innocence, which
would be a name more suitable to one who has been
the means of ridden the world of such a despicable
monster.”</p></div>

<p>[My informant complained bitterly, and not
without reason, of the printer. “Average,”
for instance (which I have <i>italicised</i>), should be
“avenger.” The “average of outraged innocence!”]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It appears by the Columns of the Corour le Constituonal
of Brussels,” runs the paper, “that the evening
before last, three men one of which is supposed to
be the miscreant, Haynau entered a Cafe in the Neighbourhood
of Brussels kept by a man in the name of
Priduex, and after partaking of some refreshments
which were ordered by his two companions they desired
to be shown to their chambers, during their stay
in the public or Travellers Room, they spoke but little
and seemed to be very cautious as to joining in the
conversations which was passing briskly round the
festive board, which to use the landlord’s own words
was rather strange, as his Cafe was mostly frequented
by a set of jovial fellows. M. Priduex goes on to
state that after the three strangers had retired to rest
some time a tall and rather noble looking man enveloped
in a large cloak entered and asked for a bed, and after
calling for some wine he took up a paper and appeared
to be reading it very attentively, in due time he was
shown to bed and all passed on without any appearance
of anything wrong until about 6 o’clock in the
morning, when the landlord and his family, were
roused by a noise over head and cries of murder, and
upon going up stairs to ascertain the cause, he discovered
the person who was [known] to be Marshal
Haynau, lying on his bed with his throat cut in a
frightful manner, and his two companions standing by
his bed side bewailing his loss. On the table was discovered
a card, on which was written these words
‘Monster, I am avenged at last.’ Suspicion went upon
the tall stranger, who was not anywhere to be found,
the Garde arms instantly were on the alert, and are
now in active persuit of him but up to the time of our
going to press nothing further has transpired.”</p></div>

<p>It is very easy to stigmatise the death-hunter
when he sets off all the attractions of a real or
pretended murder,&mdash;when he displays on a board,
as does the standing patterer, “illustrations” of
“the ’dentical pick-axe” of Manning, or the
stable of Good,&mdash;or when he invents or embellishes
atrocities which excite the public mind.
He does, however, but follow in the path of
those who are looked up to as “the press,”&mdash;as
the “fourth estate.” The conductors of the
<i>Lady’s Newspaper</i> sent an artist to Paris to give
drawings of the scene of the murder by the
Duc de Praslin,&mdash;to “illustrate” the blood-stains
in the duchess’s bed-chamber. The
<i>Illustrated London News</i> is prompt in depicting
the locality of any atrocity over which the
curious in crime may gloat. The <i>Observer</i>, in
costly advertisements, boasts of its 20 columns
(sometimes with a supplement) of details of
some vulgar and mercenary bloodshed,&mdash;the
details being written in a most honest deprecation
of the morbid and savage tastes to which
the writer is pandering. Other weekly papers
have engravings&mdash;and only concerning murder&mdash;of
any wretch whom vice has made notorious.
Many weekly papers had expensive telegraphic
despatches of Rush’s having been hung at
Norwich, which event, happily for the interest
of Sunday newspapers, took place in Norwich
at noon on a Saturday. [I may here remark,
that the patterers laugh at telegraphs and express
trains for rapidity of communication,
boasting that the press strives in vain to rival
<i>them</i>,&mdash;as at a “hanging match,” for instance,
the patterer has the full particulars, dying
speech, and confession included&mdash;if a confession
be feasible&mdash;ready for his customers the
moment the drop falls, and while the criminal
may still be struggling, at the very scene of
the hanging. At a distance he sells it before
the hanging. “If the <i>Times</i> was cross-examined
about it,” observed one patterer, “he must confess
he’s outdone, though he’s a rich <i>Times</i>, and
we is poor fellows.” But to resume&mdash;]</p>

<p>A penny-a-liner is reported, and without contradiction,
to have made a large sum by having
hurried to Jersey in Manning’s business, and by
being allowed to accompany the officers when
they conducted that paltry tool of a vindictive
woman from Jersey to Southampton by steamer,
and from Southampton to London by “special
engine,” as beseemed the popularity of so distinguished
a rascal and homicide; and next
morning the daily papers, in all the typographical
honour of “leads” and “a good
place,” gave details of this fellow’s&mdash;this Manning’s&mdash;conversation,
looks, and demeanour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Until the “respectable” press become a more
healthful public instructor, we have no right to
blame the death-hunter, who is but an imitator&mdash;a
follower&mdash;and that for a meal. So strong
has this morbid feeling about criminals become,
that an earl’s daughter, who had “an order” to
see Bedlam, would not leave the place until
she had obtained Oxford’s autograph for her
album! The rich vulgar are but the poor
vulgar&mdash;without an excuse for their vulgarity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Next to murders, fires are tidy browns,” I
was told by a patterer experienced both in
“murders” and “fires.” The burning of the
old Houses of Parliament was very popular
among street-sellers, and for the reason which
ensures popularity to a commercial people; it
was a source of profit, and was certainly made
the most of. It was the work of incendiaries,&mdash;of
ministers, to get rid of perplexing papers,&mdash;of
government officers with troublesome accounts
to balance,&mdash;of a sporting lord, for a heavy
wager,&mdash;of a conspiracy of builders,&mdash;and of “a
unsuspected party.” The older “hands” with
whom I conversed on the subject, all agreed in
stating that they “did well” on the fire. One
man said, “No, sir, it wasn’t only the working
people that bought of me, but merchants and
their clerks. I s’pose they took the papers home
with ’em for their wives and families, which is
a cheap way of doing, as a newspaper costs 3<i>d.</i>
at least. But stop, sir,&mdash;stop; there wasn’t no
threepennies then,&mdash;nothing under 6<i>d.</i>, if they
wasn’t more; I can’t just say, but it was better
for us when newspapers was high. I never
heard no sorrow expressed,&mdash;not <i>in</i> the least.
Some said it was a good job, and they wished
the ministers was in it.” The burning of the
Royal Exchange was not quite so beneficial to
the street-sellers, but “was uncommon tidy.”
The fire at the Tower, however, was almost as
great a source of profit as that of the Houses of
Parliament, and the following statement shows
the profit reaped.</p>

<p>My informant had been a gentleman’s servant,
his last place being with a gentleman in
Russell-square, who went to the East Indies,
and his servant was out of a situation so long
that he “parted with everything.” When he
was at the height of his distress, he went to see
the fire at the Tower, as he “had nothing better
to do.” He remained out some hours, and
before he reached his lodging, men passed him,
crying the full and true particulars of the fire.
“I bought one,” said the man, “and changed
my last shilling. It was a sudden impulse, for
I saw people buy keenly. I never read it, but
only looked at the printer’s name. I went to
him at the Dials, and bought some, and so I
went into the paper trade. I made 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i>
some days, while the Tower lasted; and 3<i>s.</i> and
4<i>s.</i> other days, when the first polish was off. I
sold them mostly at 1<i>d.</i> a piece at first. It was
good money then. The Tower was good, or
middling good, for from 14 to 20 days. There
was at least 100 men working nothing but the
Tower. There’s no great chance of any more
great buildings being burnt; worse luck. People
don’t care much about private fires. A man in
this street don’t heed so much who’s burnt to
death in the next. But the foundation-stone of
the new Royal Exchange&mdash;fire led to that&mdash;was
pretty fair, and portraits of Halbert went off, so
that it was for two or three days as good as the
Tower. Fires is our best friends next to murders,
if they’re <i>good</i> fires. The hopening of the
Coal Exchange was rather tidy. I’ve been in
the streets ever since, and don’t see how I could
possibly get out of them. At first I felt a great
degradation at being driven to the life. I shunned
grooms and coachmen, as I might be known
to them. I didn’t care for others. That sort
of feeling wears out though. I’m a widower
now, and my family feels, as I did at first, that
what I’m doing is ‘low.’ They won’t assist&mdash;though
they may give me 1<i>s.</i> now and then&mdash;but
they won’t assist me to leave the streets. They’ll
rather blame me for going into them, though
there was only that, or robbing, or starving.
The fire at Ben. Caunt’s, where the poor children
was burnt to hashes, was the best of the
private house fires that I’ve worked, I think.
I made 4<i>s.</i> on it one day. He was the champion
once, and was away at a fight at the time, and
it was a shocking thing, and so people bought.”</p>

<p>After the burning of York Minster by Jonathan
Martin, I was told by an old hand, the
(street) destruction of the best known public
buildings in the country was tried; such as
Canterbury Cathedral, Dover Castle, the Brighton
Pavilion, Edinburgh Castle, or Holyrood
House&mdash;all known to “travelling” patterers&mdash;but
the success was not sufficiently encouraging.
It was no use, I was told, firing such places as
Hampton Court or Windsor Castle, for unless
people <i>saw</i> the reflection of a great fire, they
wouldn’t buy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sellers of Second Editions.</span></h3>

<p>These “second editions” are, and almost
universally, second or later editions of the
newspapers, morning and evening, but three-fourths
of the sale may be of the evening
papers, and more especially of the <i>Globe</i> and
<i>Standard</i>.</p>

<p>I believe that there is not now in existence&mdash;unless
it be in a workhouse and unknown to his
fellows, or engaged in some other avocation and
lost sight of by them&mdash;any one who sold “second
editions” (the <i>Courier</i> evening paper being
then in the greatest demand) at the time of the
Duke of York’s Walcheren expedition, at the
period of the battle of the Nile, during the
continuance of the Peninsular war, or even at
the battle of Waterloo. There were a few old
men&mdash;some of whom had been soldiers or sailors,
and others who have simulated it&mdash;surviving
within these 5 or 6 years, and some later,
who “worked Waterloo,” but they were swept
off, I was told, by the cholera.</p>

<p>I was assured by a gentlemen who had a
perfect remembrance of the “second editions”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
(as they were generally called) sold in the
streets, and who had often bought them upwards
of forty years ago, that a sketch in the
“Monthly Review,” in a notice of Scott’s
“Lord of the Isles” (published in 1815), gave
the best notion he had met with of what the
second edition sale really was. At the commencement
of the sixth canto of his poem, Sir
Walter, somewhat too grandiloquently, in the
judgment of his reviewer, <span class="lock">asks&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“O who, that shared them, ever shall forget</div>
       <div class="verse">The emotions of the spirit-rousing time,</div>
       <div class="verse">When breathless in the mart the couriers met,</div>
       <div class="verse">Early and late, at evening and at prime?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Who,” in his turn asks the reviewer, “can
avoid conjuring up the idea of men with broad
sheets of foolscap, scored with ‘<span class="smcap lowercase">VICTORIES</span>’
rolled round their hats, and horns blowing loud
defiance in each other’s mouth, from the top to
the bottom of Pall-mall or the Haymarket, when
he reads such a passage? We actually hear
the Park and Tower guns, and the clattering of
ten thousand bells, as we read, and stop our ears
from the close and sudden intrusion of some
hot and <i>horn-fisted</i> patriot, blowing ourselves, as
well as Bonaparte to the devil!”</p>

<p>The horn carried by these “<i>horn</i>-fisted” men
was a common tin tube, from two to three feet
long, and hardly capable of being made to
produce any sound beyond a sudden and discordant
“trump, trump.” The men worked
with papers round their hats, in a way not very
dissimilar to that of the running patterers of
to-day.</p>

<p>The “editions” cried by these men during the
war-time often contained spurious intelligence,
but for that the editors of the journals were responsible&mdash;or
the stock-jobbers who had imposed
upon them. Any one who has consulted a file
of newspapers of the period to which I have
referred, will remember how frequent, and how
false, were the announcements, or the rumours,
of the deaths of Bonaparte, his brothers, or
his marshals, in battle or by assassination.</p>

<p>As there was no man who was personally
conversant with this traffic in what is emphatically
enough called the “war-time,” I
sought out an old street-patterer who had been
acquainted with the older hands in the trade,
whose experience stretched to the commencement
of the present century, and from him I
received the following account:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he began, “I’ve worked ‘seconds.’
We used to call the editions generally
seconds, and cry them sometimes, as the <i>latest</i>
editions, whatever it was. There was Jack Griffiths,
sir,&mdash;now wasn’t he a hand at a second
edition? I believe you. I do any kind of patter
now myself, but I’ve done tidy on second editions,
when seconds was to be had. Why, Jack
Griffiths, sir&mdash;he’d been a sailor and was fond
of talking about the sea&mdash;Jack Griffiths&mdash;you
would have liked to have heard him&mdash;Jack
told me that he once took 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;it was
Hyde Park way&mdash;for a second edition of a paper
when Queen Caroline’s trial was over. Besides
Jack, there was Tom Cole, called the Wooden
Leg (he’d been a soldier I believe), and Whitechapel,
and Old Brummagem, and Hell-fire
Jack. Hell-fire Jack was said to be something
to a man that was a trainer, and a great
favourite of the old Duke of Queensberry, and
was called Hell-fire Dick; but I can’t say
how it was. I began to work second editions,
for the first time when George IV. died. They
went off pretty well at 1<i>s.</i> a piece, and for three
or four I got 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> If it’s anything good I
get 1<i>s.</i> still, but very seldom any more. I
always show anybody that asks that the paper
<i>is</i> just what I’ve cried it. There’s no regular
cry; we cries what’s up: ‘<i>Here’s</i> the second
edition of the <i>Globe</i> with the full perticlers of
the death of his Majesty King George IV.’
We work much in the same way as the running
patter. Three of us shouts in the same spot.
I was one of three who one night sold five
quires, mostly <i>Globe</i> and <i>Standard</i>. It was at
the Reform Bill time, and something about the
Reform Bill. I never much heeded what the
paper was about. I only wanted the patter,
and soon got it. A mate, or any of us, looks
out for anything good in the evening papers,
to be ready. Why that night I speak of I
was kept running backards and for’ards to the
newspaper offices&mdash;and how they does keep
you waiting at times!&mdash;mostly the <i>Globe</i> and
<i>Standard</i>; we worked them all at the West
End. There’s twenty-seven papers to a quire,
and we gave 4<i>d.</i> a piece for ’em and sold none,
as well as I mind, for under 1<i>s.</i> I carried
them mostly under my arm or in my hat,
taking care they wasn’t spoiled. Belgrave-square
way, and St. George’s, Hanover-square
way, and Hyde Park way, are the best. The
City’s no good. There’s only sixpences there.
The coffee-shops has spoiled the City, as I’m
afeard they will other parts. Murders in
second editions don’t sell now, and aren’t
tried much, beyond a few, if there’s a late
verdict. Curviseer (Courvoisier) was tidy. The
trial weren’t over ’til evening, and I sold six
papers, and got 7<i>s.</i> for them, to gentlemen
going away by the mail. I’ve heard that
Greenacre was good in the same way, but I
wasn’t in town at the time. The French
Revolution&mdash;the last one&mdash;was certainly a
fairish go. Lewis Fillup was good many
ways. When he used to be shot at&mdash;if the
news weren’t too early in the day&mdash;and when
he got to England, and when he was said to
have got back, or to have been taken. Why,
of course he wern’t to compare with Rush in
the regular patter, but he was very fair. I
have nothing to say against him, and wish he
was alive, and could do it all over again. Lord
Brougham’s death wern’t worth much to us.
You remember the time, I dare say, sir, when
they said he killed hisself in the papers, to
see what folks would say on him. The resignation
of a prime minister is mostly pretty
good. Lord Melbourne was, and so was Sir
Robert Peel. There’s always somebody to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
‘Hurra! that’s right!’ and to buy a paper
because he’s pleased. I had a red paper in
my hat when I worked the French Revolution.
French news is generally liked in a fashionable
drag. Irish news is no good, for people don’t
seem to believe it. Smith O’Brien’s battle,
though, did sell a little. It’s not possible to
tell you exactly what I’ve made on seconds.
How can I? One week I may have cleared
1<i>l.</i> in them, and for six months before not a
blessed brown. Perhaps&mdash;as near as I can
recollect and calculate&mdash;I’ve cleared 3<i>l.</i> (if
that) each year, one with another, in second
editions in my time, and perhaps twenty others
has done the same.”</p>

<p>Another man who also knew the old hands
said to me: “Lord bless us, how times is
changed! you should have heard Jack Griffiths
tell how he cried his gazettes: ‘<i>He-ere’s</i>
the <i>London Gazette</i> Ex-terornary, containing
the hof-ficial account of the bloody and decisive
wictory of Sally-manker.’ Something that
way. Patter wern’t required then; the things
sold theirselves. Why, the other day I was
talking to a young chap that conceits hisself to
be a hout-and-houter in patter, and I mentions
Jack’s crying Gazettes and getting 5<i>s.</i>
apiece for many a one on ’em, and this young
chap says, says he: ‘<i>Gazettes!</i> What did
they cry <i>Gazettes</i>?&mdash;bankrupts, and all that?’
‘Bankrupts be blowed!’ said I, ‘wictories!’ I
heerd Waterloo cried when I was a little ’un.
The speeches on the opening of parliament,
which the newspapers has ready, has no sale
in the crowd to what they had. I only sold
two papers at 6<i>d.</i> each this last go. I ventured
on no more, or should have been a loser.
If the Queen isn’t there, none’s sold. But we
always has a speech ready, as close as can be got
from what the morning papers says. One gent.
said to me: ‘But that ain’t the real speech!’
‘It’s a far better,’ says I, and so it is. Why
now, sir, there’s some reading and spirit in
this bit. The Queen says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘It is my determination by the assistance of divine
providence to uphold and protect the Protestant
Church of the British Empire, which has been enjoyed
three hundred years without interuption, the
Religion which our ancestors struggled to obtain.
And as long as it shall please God to spare me, I
will endeavour to maintain the rights and perogatives
of our holy Protestant Church. And now my Lords,
I leave you to your duties, to the helm of the state, to
the harbour of peace, and happiness.’”</p></div>

<p>This man showed me the street speech, which
was on a broad sheet set off with the royal
arms. The topics and arrangement were the
same as those in the speech delivered by her
Majesty.</p>

<p>On Monday morning last (Feb. 24), I asked
the man who told me that prime ministers’ resignations
were “pretty good” for the street
traffic, if he had been well remunerated by the
sale of the evening papers of Saturday, with
the account of Lord John Russell’s resignation.
“It wern’t tried, sir,” he answered; “there was
nothing new in the evenings, and we thought
nobody seemed to care about it. The newspaper
offices and their boarders (as he called
the men going about with announcements on
boards) didn’t make very much of it, so we got
up a song instead, but it was no good,&mdash;not salt
to a fresh herring&mdash;for there was some fresh
herrings in. It was put strong, though. This
was the last verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘From the House to the Palace it has caused a bother,</div>
       <div class="verse">Old women are tumbling one over another,</div>
       <div class="verse">The Queen says it is with her, one thing or ’tother,</div>
       <div class="verse indent6">They must not discharge Little John;</div>
       <div class="verse">Her Majesty vows that she is not contented,</div>
       <div class="verse">And many ere long will have cause to repent it,</div>
       <div class="verse">Had she been in the house she would nobly resent it,</div>
       <div class="verse indent6">And fought like a brick for Lord John.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Adopting the calculation of my first informant,
and giving a profit of 150 per cent., we
find 150<i>l.</i> yearly expended in the streets, in
second editions, or probably it might be more
correct to say 200<i>l.</i> in a year of great events,
and 50<i>l.</i> in a year when such events are few.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Standing Patterers.</span></h3>

<p>The standing patterer I have already described
in his resemblance to the mountebank of old,
and how, like his predecessor, he required a
“pitch” and an audience. I need but iterate
that these standing patterers are men who remain
in one place, until they think they have
exhausted the custom likely to accrue there, or
until they are removed by the police; and who
endeavour to attract attention to their papers,
or more commonly pamphlets, either by means
of a board with coloured pictures upon it, illustrative
of the contents of what they sell, or else
by gathering a crowd round about them, in
giving a lively or horrible description of the
papers or books they are “working.” The
former is what is usually denominated in street
technology, “board work.” A few of the standing
patterers give street recitations or dialogues.</p>

<p>Some of the “illustrations” most “in vogue”
of late for the boards of the standing patterers
were,&mdash;the flogging of the nuns of Minsk, the
blood streaming from their naked shoulders,
(anything against the Emperor of Russia, I was
told, was a good street subject for a painting);
the young girl, Sarah Thomas, who murdered
her mistress in Bristol, dragged to the gallows
by the turnkeys and Calcraft, the hangman;
Calcraft himself, when charged with “starving
his mother;” Haynau, in the hands of the
draymen; the Mannings, and afterwards the
Sloanes. The two last-mentioned were among
the most elaborate, each having a series of
“compartments,” representing the different
stages of the events in which those heroes and
heroines flourished. I shall speak afterwards
of street-artists who are the painters of these
boards, and then describe the pictures more
fully. There are also, as before alluded to,
what may be called “cocks” in street paintings,
as well as street literature.</p>

<p>Two of the most favourite themes of the
standing patterers were, however, the “Annals
of the White House in Soho-square,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
“Mysteries of Mesmerism.” Both supplied
subjects to the boards.</p>

<p>The White House was a notorious place of ill
fame. Some of the apartments, it is said, were
furnished in a style of costly luxury; while
others were fitted up with springs, traps, and
other contrivances, so as to present no appearance
other than that of an ordinary room, until
the machinery was set in motion. In one room,
into which some wretched girl might be introduced,
on her drawing a curtain as she would be
desired, a skeleton, grinning horribly, was precipitated
forward, and caught the terrified
creature in his, to all appearance, bony arms.
In another chamber the lights grew dim, and
then seemed gradually to go out. In a little
time some candles, apparently self-ignited, revealed
to a horror stricken woman, a black
coffin, on the lid of which might be seen, in
brass letters, <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, or whatever name it had
been ascertained the poor wretch was known by.
A sofa, in another part of the mansion, was
made to descend into some place of utter darkness;
or, it was alleged, into a room in which
was a store of soot or ashes.</p>

<p>Into the truth or exaggeration of these and
similar statements, it is not my business to
inquire; but the standing patterer made the
most of them. Although the house in question
has been either rebuilt or altered&mdash;I was told
that each was the case&mdash;and its abominable
character has ceased to apply to it for some
years, the patterer did not scruple to represent it
as still in existence (though he might change
the venue as to the square at discretion) and
that all the atrocities perpetrated&mdash;to which I
have not ventured even to allude&mdash;were still the
ordinary procedures of “high life.” Neither
did the standing patterer scruple, as one man
assured me, to “name names;” to attribute vile
deeds to any nobleman or gentleman whose
name was before the public; and to embellish
his story by an allusion to a recent event. He
not unfrequently ended with a moral exhortation
to all ladies present to avoid this “abode of
iniquity for the rich.” The board was illustrated
with skeletons, coffins, and other horrors;
but neither on it, nor in a hardly intelligible
narrative which the patterer sold, was there
anything indecent.</p>

<p>The “Mysteries of Mesmerism” was an account
of the marvels of that “newly-discovered
and most wonderful power in natur and art.”
With it Dr. Elliotson’s, or some well-known
name, was usually associated, and any marvel
was “pattered,” according to the patterer’s taste
and judgment. The illustrations were of persons,
generally women, in a state of coma, but in this
also there was no indecency; nor was there in
the narrative sold.</p>

<p>Of these two popular exhibitions there are,
I am informed, none now in town, and both, I
was told, was more the speculations of a printer,
who sent out men, than in the hands of the
regular patterers.</p>

<p>It may tend somewhat to elucidate the character
of the patterers, if I here state, that in
my conversation with the whole of them, I
heard from their lips strong expressions of
disgust at Sloane,&mdash;far stronger than were
uttered in abhorrence of any murderer. Rush,
indeed, was, and is, a popular man among
them. One of them told me, that not long
before Madame Tussaud’s death, he thought of
calling upon that “wenerable lady,” and asking
her, he said, “to treat me to something to drink
the immortal memory of Mr. Rush, my friend
and her’n.”</p>

<p>It is admitted by all concerned in the exercise
of street elocution, that “the stander” must
have “the best of patter.” He usually works
alone,&mdash;there are very rarely two at standing
patter,&mdash;and beyond his board he has no adventitious
aids, as in the running patter, so that he
must be all the more effective; but the board is
pronounced “as good as a man.” When the
standing patterer visits the country, he is accompanied
by a mate, and the “copy of werses”
is then announced as being written by an “under-paid
curate” within a day’s walk. “It tells
mostly, sir,” said one man; “for it’s a blessing
to us that there always is a journeyman parson
what the people knows, and what the patter
fits.” Sometimes the poetry is attributed to a
sister of mercy, or to a popular poetess; very
frequently, by the patterers who best understand
the labouring classes, to Miss Eliza
Cook. Sometimes the verses are written by
“a sympathising gent. in that parish,” but his
name wasn’t to be mentioned. Another intelligent
patterer whom I questioned on the subject,
told me that my information was correct.
“It’s just the same in the newspapers,” he
continued; “why the ‘sympathising gent.’ is
the same with us as what in the newspapers
is called “other intelligence (about any crime),
to publish which might defeat the ends of
justice.” That means, they know nothing at
all about it, and can’t so much as venture on
a guess. I’ve known a little about it for the
papers, sir,&mdash;it doesn’t matter in what line.”</p>

<p>Some standing patterers are brought up to the
business from childhood. Some take to it
through loss of character, or through their inability
to obtain a situation from intemperate
habits, and some because “a free life suits me
best.” In a former inquiry into a portion of
this subject, I sought a standing patterer, whom
I found in a threepenny lodging-house in Mint-street,
Southwark. On my inquiring what induced
him to adopt, or pursue, that line of life,
he <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It was distress that first drove me to it. I
had learnt to make willow bonnets, but that
branch of trade went entirely out. So, having a
wife and children, I was drove to write out a
paper that I called ‘The People’s Address to
the King on the Present State of the Nation.’
I got it printed, and took it into the streets and
sold it. I did very well with it, and made 5<i>s.</i> a
day while it lasted. I never was brought up to
any mechanical trade. My father was a cler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>gyman”
[here he cried bitterly]. “It breaks
my heart when I think of it. I have as good a
wife as ever lived, and I would give the world to
get out of my present life. It would be heaven
to get away from the place where I am. I am
obliged to cheer up my spirits. If I was to give
way to it, I shouldn’t live long. It’s like a little
hell to be in the place where we live” [crying],
“associated with the ruffians that we are. My
distress of mind is awful, but it won’t do to show
it at my lodgings&mdash;they’d only laugh to see me
down-hearted; so I keep my trouble all to
myself. Oh, I am heartily sick of this street
work&mdash;the insults I have to put up with&mdash;the
drunken men swearing at me. Yes, indeed, I
am heartily sick of it.”</p>

<p>This poor man had some assistance forwarded
to him by benevolent persons, after his case had
appeared in my letter in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.
This was the means of his leaving the streets,
and starting in the “cloth-cap trade.” He
seemed a deserving man.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experience of a Standing Patterer.</span></h3>

<p>From one of this body I received, at the period
just alluded to, the following <span class="lock">information:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have taken my 5<i>s.</i> a day (said my informant);
but ‘paper’ selling now isn’t half so good
as it used to be. People haven’t got the money
to lay out; for it all depends with the working
man. The least we take in a day is, upon an
average, sixpence; but taking the good and bad
together, I should say we take about 10<i>s.</i> a week.
I know there’s some get more than that, but
then there’s many take less. Lately, I know,
I haven’t taken 9<i>s.</i> a week myself, and people
reckon me one of the best patterers in the trade.
I’m reckoned to have the gift&mdash;that is, the gift
of the gab. I never works a last dying speech
on any other than the day of execution&mdash;all the
edge is taken off of it after that. The last dying
speeches and executions are all printed the day
before. They’re always done on the Sunday, if
the murderers are to be hung on the Monday.
I’ve been and got them myself on the Sunday
night, over and over again. The flying stationers
goes with the papers in their pockets,
and stand under the drop, and as soon as ever it
falls, and long before the breath is out of the
body, they begin bawling out.” [Here my informant
gave a further account of the flying
stationers under the gallows, similar to what I
have given. He averred that they “invented
every lie likely to go down.”] “‘Here you
have also an exact likeness,’ they say, ‘of the
murderer, taken at the bar of the Old Bailey!’
when all the time it is an old wood-cut that’s
been used for every criminal for the last forty
years. I know the likeness that was given of
Hocker was the one that was given for Fauntleroy;
and the wood-cut of Tawell was one that
was given for the Quaker that had been hanged
for forgery twenty years before. Thurtell’s
likeness was done expressly for the ‘papers;’
and so was the Mannings’ and Rush’s likenesses
too. The murders are bought by men,
women, and children. Many of the tradespeople
bought a great many of the affair of the Mannings.
I went down to Deptford with mine,
and did uncommonly well. I sold all off.
Gentlefolks won’t have anything to do with
murders sold in the street; they’ve got other
ways of seeing all about it. We lay on the
horrors, and picture them in the highest colours
we can. We don’t care what’s in the ‘papers’
in our hands. All we want to do is to sell ’em;
and the more horrible we makes the affairs, the
more sale we have. We do very well with ‘love-letters.’
They are ‘cocks;’ that is, they are all
fictitious. We give it out that they are from a
tradesman in the neighbourhood, not a hundred
yards from where we are a-standing. Sometimes
we say it’s a well-known sporting butcher;
sometimes it’s a highly respectable publican&mdash;just
as it will suit the tastes of the neighbourhood.
I got my living round Cornwall for one
twelvemonth with nothing else than a love-letter.
It was headed, ‘A curious and laughable
love-letter and puzzle, sent by a sporting gentleman
to Miss H&mdash;s&mdash;m, in <i>this</i> neighbourhood;’
that suits any place that I may chance to be in;
but I always patter the name of the street or
village where I may be. This letter, I say, is
so worded, that had it fallen into the hands of
her mamma or papa, they could not have told
what it meant; but the young lady, having so
much wit, found out its true meaning, and sent
him an answer in the same manner. You have
here, we say, the number of the house, the name
of the place where she lives (there is nothing of
the kind, of course), and the initials of all the
parties concerned. We dare not give the real
names in full, we tell them; indeed, we do all
we can to get up the people’s curiosity. I did
very well with the ‘Burning of the House of
Commons.’ I happened by accident to put my
pipe into my pocket amongst some of my papers,
and burnt them. Then, not knowing how to
get rid of them, I got a few straws. I told the
people that my burnt papers were parliamentary
documents that had been rescued from the
flames, and that, as I dare not sell them, I
would let them have a straw for a penny, and
give them one of the papers. By this trick I got
rid of my stock twice as fast, and got double the
price that I should have done. The papers had
nothing at all to do with the House of Commons.
Some was ‘Death and the Lady,’ and ‘Death
and the Gentleman,’ and others were the ‘Political
Catechism,’ and 365 lies, Scotch, English,
and Irish, and each lie as big round as St. Paul’s.
I remember a party named Jack Straw, who laid
a wager, half-a-gallon of beer, that he’d bring
home the money for two dozen blank papers in one
hour’s time. He went out into the Old-street-road,
and began a patter about the political affairs
of the nation, and Sir Robert Peel, and the Duke
of Wellington, telling the public that he dared
not sell his papers, they were treasonable; so he
gave them with a straw&mdash;that he sold for one
penny. In less than the hour he was sold clean
out, and returned and drank the beer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
chief things that I work are quarter-sheets of
recitations and dialogues. One is ‘Good Advice
to Young Men on Choosing their Wives.’ I have
done exceedingly well with that&mdash;it’s a good
moral thing. Another is the ‘Drunkard’s Catechism;’
another is ‘The Rent Day; or, the
Landlord gathering his Rents.’ This is a dialogue
between the landlord and his tenant, beginning
with ‘Good morning, Mrs. Longface;
have you got my rent ready, ma’am?’ The
next one is ‘The Adventures of Larry O’Flinn.’
It’s a comic story, and a very good got-up
thing. Another is ‘A Hint to Husbands and
Wives;’ and ‘A Pack of Cards turned into a
Bible, a Prayer-book, and an Almanack.’ These
cards belonged to Richard Middleton, of the
60th regiment of foot, who was taken a prisoner
for playing at cards in church during divine
service. But the best I do is ‘The Remarkable
Dream of a Young Man of loose character,
who had made an agreement to break into
a gentleman’s house at twelve at night on
Whitsun Monday, but, owing to a little drink
that he took, he had a remarkable dream,
and dreamed he was in hell. The dream had
such influence on his mind that he refused to
meet his comrade. His comrade was taken up
for the burglary, found guilty, and executed
for it. This made such an impression on the
young man’s mind that he became a reformed
character.’ There is a very beautiful description
of hell in this paper,” said my informant, “that
makes it sell very well among the old women
and the apprentice lads, for the young man was
an apprentice himself. It’s all in very pretty
poetry, and a regular ‘cock.’ The papers that
I work chiefly are what are called ‘the standing
patters;’ they’re all of ’em stereotype, and
some of them a hundred years old. We consider
the ‘death hunters’ are the lowest grade
in the trade. We can make most money of
the murders while they last, but they don’t
last, and they merely want a good pair of lungs
to get them off. But it’s not every one, sir,
that can work the standing patters. Many
persons I’ve seen try at it and fail. One old
man I knew tried the ‘Drunkard’s Catechism’
and the ‘Soldier’s Prayer-book and Bible.’ He
could manage to patter these because they’ll
almost work themselves; but ‘Old Mother
Clifton’ he broke down in. I heard him do it
in Sun-street and in the Blackfriars-road; but
it was such a dreadful failure&mdash;he couldn’t
humour it a bit&mdash;that, thinks I to myself, you’ll
soon have to give up, and sure enough he’s
never been to the printer’s since. He’d a very
poor audience, chiefly boys and girls, and they
were laughing at him because he made so many
blunders in it. A man that’s never been to school
an hour can go and patter a dying speech or
‘A Battle between Two Ladies of Fortune.’ They
require no scholarship. All you want is to stick
a picture on your hat, to attract attention, and to
make all the noise you can. It’s all the same
when they does an ‘Assassination of Louis
Philippe,’ or a ‘Diabolical Attempt on the Life
of the Queen’&mdash;a good stout pair of lungs and
plenty of impudence is all that is required. But
to patter ‘Bounce, the Workhouse Beadle, and
the Examination of the Paupers before the Poor-law
Commissioners,’ takes a good head-piece
and great gift of the gab, let me tell you. It’s
just the same as a play-actor. I can assure you
I often feel very nervous. I begin it, and walk
miles before I can get confidence in myself to
make the attempt. I got rid of two quire last
night. I was up among the gentlemen’s servants
in Crawford-street, Baker-street, and I had a
very good haul out of the grown-up people.
I cleared 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> altogether. I did that from
seven till nine in the evening. It’s all chance-work.
If it’s fine, and I can get a crowd of
grown-up people round me, I can do very well,
but I can’t do anything amongst the boys.
There’s very little to be done in the day-time.
I begin at ten in the day, and stop out till one.
After that I starts off again at five, and leaves
off about ten at night. Marylebone, Paddington,
and Westminster I find the best places.
The West-end is very good the early part of the
week, for any thing that’s genteel, such as the
‘Rich Man and his Wife quarrelling because
they have no Family.’ Our customers there are
principally the footmen, the grooms, and the maid-servants.
The east end of the town is the best
on Friday and Saturday evenings. I very often
go to Limehouse on Friday evening. Most part
of the dock-men are paid then, and anything
comic goes off well among them. On Saturdays
I go to the New-cut, Ratcliff-highway, the Brill,
and such places. I make mostly 2<i>s.</i> clear on a
Saturday night. After nineteen years’ experience
of the patter and paper line in the streets,
I find that a foolish nonsensical thing will sell
twice as fast as a good moral sentimental one;
and, while it lasts, a good murder will cut out
the whole of them. It’s the best selling thing
of any. I used at one time to patter religious
tracts in the street, but I found no encouragement.
I did the ‘Infidel Blacksmith’&mdash;that
would not sell. ‘What is Happiness? a Dialogue
between Ellen and Mary’&mdash;that was no
go. No more was the ‘Sorrows of Seduction.’
So I was driven into the comic standing patters.”</p>

<p>The more recent “experiences” of standing
patterers, as they were detailed to me, differ so
little in subject, or anything else, from what I
have given concerning running patterers, that to
cite them would be a repetition.</p>

<p>From the best information to be obtained, I
have no doubt that there are always at least 20
standing patterers&mdash;sometimes they are called
“boardmen”&mdash;at work in London. Some of
them “run” occasionally, but an equal number
or more, of the regular “runners” resort now
and then to the standing patter, so the sum is
generally kept up.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the drawbacks of bad weather,
which affects the standing, and does not
affect the running, patterer; and notwithstanding
the more frequent interruptions of the police,
I am of opinion that the standing patterer earns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
on an average 1<i>s.</i> a week more than his running
brother. His earnings too are often all his
own; whereas the runners are a ‘school,’ and,
their gains divided. More running patterers
become, on favourable occasions, stationary,
with boards, perhaps in the proportion of five to
four, than the stationary become itinerant. One
standing patterer told me, that, during the excitement
about the Sloanes, he cleared full 3<i>s.</i> a
day for more than a week; but at other times
he had cleared only 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in a whole week,
and he had taken nothing when the weather
was too wet for the standing work, and there
was nothing up to “run” with.</p>

<p>If, then, 20 standing patterers clear 10<i>s.</i>
weekly, each, the year through&mdash;“taking” 15<i>s.</i>
weekly&mdash;we find that 780<i>l.</i> is yearly expended
in the standing patter of London streets.</p>

<p>The capital required for the start of the
standing is greater than that needed by the
running patterer. The painting for a board
costs 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; the board and pole, with feet, to
which it is attached, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and stock-money,
2<i>s.</i>; in all, 11<i>s.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Political Litanies, Dialogues, etc.</span></h3>

<p>To “work a litany” in the streets is considered
one of the higher exercises of professional skill
on the part of the patterer. In working this, a
clever patterer&mdash;who will not scruple to introduce
anything out of his head which may strike
him as suitable to his audience&mdash;is very particular
in his choice of a mate, frequently changing
his ordinary partner, who may be good “at a
noise” or a ballad, but not have sufficient acuteness
or intelligence to patter politics as if he
understood what he was speaking about. I am
told that there are not twelve patterers in London
whom a critical professor of street elocution
will admit to be capable of ‘working a catechism’
or a litany. “Why, sir,” said one patterer,
“I’ve gone out with a mate to work a
litany, and he’s humped it in no time.” To
‘hump,’ in street parlance, is equivalent to
‘botch,’ in more genteel colloquialism. “And
when a thing’s humped,” my informant continued,
“you can only ‘call a go.’” To ‘call a
go,’ signifies to remove to another spot, or adopt
some other patter, or, in short, to resort to some
change or other in consequence of a failure.</p>

<p>An elderly man, not now in the street trade,
but who had “pattered off a few papers” some
years ago, told me that he had heard three or
four old hands&mdash;“now all dead, for they’re a
short-lived people”&mdash;talk of the profits gained
and the risk ran by giving Hone’s parodies on
the Catechism, Litany, St. Athanasius’ Creed, &amp;c.
in the streets, after the three consecutive trials
and the three acquittals of Hone had made the
parodies famous and Hone popular. To work
them in the streets was difficult, “for though,”
said my informant, “there was no new police in
them days, there was plenty of officers and constables
ready to pull the fellows up, and though
Hone was acquitted, a beak that wanted to please
the high dons, would find some way of stopping
them that sold Hone’s things in the street, and
so next to nothing could be done that way, but
a little was done.” The greatest source of profit,
I learned from the reminiscences of the same
man, was in the parlours and tap-rooms of public-houses,
where the patterers or reciters were
well paid “for going through their catechisms,”
and sometimes, that there might be no interruption,
the door was locked, and even the landlord
and his servants excluded. The charge was
usually 2<i>d.</i> a copy, but 1<i>d.</i> was not refused.</p>

<p>During Queen Caroline’s trial there were the
like interruptions and hindrances to similar performances;
and the interruptions continued during
the passing of the Catholic Emancipation
Bill until about the era of the Reform Bill, and
then the hindrance was but occasional. “And
perhaps it was our own fault, sir,” said one patterer,
“that we was then molested at all in the
dialogues and catechisms and things; but we
was uncommon bold, and what plenty called
sarcy, at that time: we was so.”</p>

<p>Thus this branch of a street profession continued
to be followed, half surreptitiously, until
after the subsidence of the political ferment
consequent on the establishment of a new franchise
and the partial abolition of an old one.
The calling, however, has never been popular
among street purchasers, and I believe that it
is sometimes followed by a street-patterer as
much from the promptings of the pride of art
as from the hope of gain.</p>

<p>The street-papers in the dialogue form have
not been copied nor derived from popular productions&mdash;but
even in the case of Political
Litanies and Anti-Corn-law Catechisms and
Dialogues are the work of street authors.</p>

<p>One intelligent man told me, that properly to
work a political litany, which referred to ecclesiastical
matters, he “made himself up,” as
well as limited means would permit, as a
bishop! and “did stunning, until he was afraid
of being stunned on skilly.” Of the late papers
on the subject of the Pope, I cite the one which
was certainly the best of all that appeared, and
concerning which indignant remonstrances were
addressed to some of the newspapers. The
“good child” in the patter, was a tall bulky
man; the examiner (also the author), was
rather <span class="lock">diminutive:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For some pitches the foregoing was sufficient,
for a street auditory “hates too long a patter;”
but where a favourable opportunity offered, easily
tested by the pecuniary beginnings, the “Lesson
of the Day” was given in addition, and was inserted
after the second “Answer” in the foregoing
parody, so preceding the “Let us say:”</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>The Lesson of the Day.</i></p>

<p>“You seem an intelligent lad, so I think you are
quite capable of Reading with me the Lessons for this
day’s service.</p>

<p>“Now the Lesson for the day is taken from all parts
of the Book of Martyr’s, beginning at just where you
like.</p>

<p>“It was about the year 1835, that a certain renagade
of the name of Pussy&mdash;I beg his pardon, I mean Pusey,
like a snake who stung his master commenced crawling
step by step, from the master; he was bound to serve
to worship a puppet, arrayed in a spangle and tincel
of a romish showman.</p>

<p>“And the pestelance that he shed around spread
rapidly through the minds of many unworthy members
of our established Church; even up to the present
year, 1850, inasmuch that St Barnabus, of Pimlico,
unable to see the truth by the aid of his occulars,
mounted four pounds of long sixes in the mid-day,
that he might see through the fog of his own folly, by
which he was surrounded.</p>

<p>“And Pope Pi-ass the nineth taking advantage of
the hubub, did create unto himself a Cardinal in the
person of one Wiseman of Westminster.</p>

<p>“And Cardinal broadbrim claimed four counties in
England as his dioces, and his master the Pope claimed
as many more as his sees, but the people of England
could not see that, so they declared aloud they would
see them blowed first.</p>

<p>“So when Jack Russell heard of his most impudent
intentions, he sent him a Letter saying it was the
intention of the people of England never again to submit
to their infamous mumerys for the burnings in
Smithfield was still fresh in their memory.</p>

<p>“And behold great meetings were held in different
parts of England where the Pope was burnt in effigy,
like unto a Yarmouth Bloater, as a token of respect for
him and his followers.</p>

<p>“And the citizens of London were stanch to a man,
and assembled together in the Guildhall of our mighty
City and shouted with stentarian lungs, long live
the Queen and down with the Pope, the sound of
which might have been heard even unto the vatican
of Rome.</p>

<p>“And when his holyness the Pope heard that his
power was set at naught, his nose became blue even
as a bilberry with rage and declared Russell and Cummings
or any who joined in the No Popery cry, should
ever name the felisity of kissing his pious great toe.</p>

<p class="center">
“<i>Thus Endeth the Lesson.</i>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>In the course of my inquiries touching this
subject I had more than once occasion to observe
that an acute patterer had always a reason, or
an excuse for anything. One quick-witted Irishman,
whom I knew to be a Roman Catholic,
was “working” a “patter against the Pope,”
(not the one I have given), and on my speaking
to him on the subject, and saying that I supposed
he did it for a living, he replied: “That’s
it then, sir. You’re right, sir, yes. I work
it just as a Catholic lawyer would plead against
a Catholic paper for a libel on Protestants&mdash;though
in his heart he knew the paper was right&mdash;and
a Protestant lawyer would defend the libel
hammer and tongs. Bless you, sir, you’ll not find
much more honour that way among us (laughing)
than among them lawyers; not much.” The
readiness with which the sharpest of those men
plead the doings not only of tradesmen, but of
the learned and sacred professions, to justify
themselves, is remarkable.</p>

<p>Sometimes a dialogue is of a satirical nature.
One man told me that the “Conversation between
Achilles and the Wellington Statue,” of
which I give the concluding moiety, was “among
the best,” (he meant for profit), “but no great
thing.” My informant was Achilles&mdash;or, as he
pronounced it, Atchilees&mdash;and his mate was the
statue, or “man on the horse.” The two lines,
in the couplet form, which precede every two
paragraphs of dialogue, seem as if they represent
the speakers wrongfully. The answer
should be attributed, in each case, to Achilles.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Of parodies other than the sort of compound
of the Litany and other portions of the Church
Service, which I have given, there are none in
the streets&mdash;neither are there political duets.
Such productions as parodies on popular songs,
“Cab! cab! cab!” or “Trip! trip! trip!” are
now almost always derived, for street-service,
from the concert-rooms. But they relate more
immediately to ballads, or street song; and not
to patter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Cocks,” etc.</span></h3>

<p>These “literary forgeries,” if so they may be
called, have already been alluded to under the
head of the “Death and Fire Hunters,” but it
is necessary to give a short account of a few of
the best and longest known of those stereotyped;
no new cocks, except for an occasion, have been
printed for some years.</p>

<p>One of the stereotyped cocks is, the “Married
Man Caught in a Trap.” One man had known
it sold “for years and years,” and it served,
he said, when there was any police report in the
papers about sweethearts in coal-cellars, &amp;c.
The illustration embraces two compartments.
In one a severe-looking female is assaulting a
man, whose hat has been knocked off by the
contents of a water-jug, which a very stout
woman is pouring on his head from a window.
In the other compartment, as if from an adjoining
room, two women look on encouragingly.
The subject matter, however, is in no accordance
with the title or the embellishment. It is a
love-letter from John S&mdash;n to his most “adorable
Mary.” He expresses the ardour of his
passion, and then twits his adored with something
beyond a flirtation with Robert E&mdash;, a
“decoyer of female innocence.” Placably
overlooking this, however, John S&mdash;n <span class="lock">continues:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dearest angel consent to my request, and keep
me no longer in suspense&mdash;nothing, on my part, shall
ever be wanting to make you happy and comfortable.
My apprenticeship will expire in four months from
hence, when I intend to open a shop in the small ware
line, and your abilities in dress-making and self-adjusting
stay-maker, and the assistance of a few female mechanics,
we shall be able to realize an independency.”</p></div>

<p>“Many a turn in seductions talked about in
the papers and not talked about nowhere,” said
one man, “has that slum served for, besides
other things, such as love-letters, and confessions
of a certain lady in this neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>Another old cock is headed, “Extraordinary
and Funny Doings in this Neighbourhood.”
The illustration is a young lady, in an evening
dress, sitting with an open letter in her hand, on a
sort of garden-seat, in what appears to be a
churchyard. After a smart song, enforcing the
ever-neglected advice that people should “look
at home and mind their own business,” are
two letters, the first from R. G.; the answer
from S. H. M. The gentleman’s epistle <span class="lock">commences:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
“Madam,<br />

“The love and tenderness I have hitherto expressed for<br />
you is false, and I now feel that my indifference towards<br />
you increases every day, and the more I see you the more<br />
you appear ridiculous in my eyes and contemptible&mdash;<br />
I feel inclined &amp; in every respect disposed &amp; determined<br />
to hate you. Believe me, I never had any inclination<br />
to offer you my hand.”<br />
</p>

<p>The lady responds in a similar strain, and the
twain appear very angry, until a foot-note offers
an explanation: “By reading every other line
of the above letters the true meaning will be
found.”</p>

<p>Of this class of cocks I need cite no other
specimens, but pass on to one of another
species&mdash;the “Cruel and Inhuman Murder
Committed on the Body of Capt. Lawson.”
The illustration is a lady, wearing a coronet,
stabbing a gentleman, in full dress, through the
top button of his waistcoat. The narrative
<span class="lock">commences:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“WITH surprise we have learned that this neighbourhood
for a length of time was amazingly alarmed
this day by a crowd of people carrying the body of Mr.
James Lawless, to a doctor while streams of blood
besmeared the way in such a manner that the cries of
Murder re-echoed the sound of numerous voices. It
appears that the cause of alarm, originated through
a court-ship attended with a solemn promise of marriage
between him and miss Lucy Guard, a handsome
young Lady of refined feelings with the intercourse of
a superior enlightened mind she lived with her aunt
who spared neither pain nor cost to improve the talents
of miss G. those seven years past, since the death of
her mother in Ludgate Hill, London, and bore a most
excellent character until she got entangled by the
delumps alcurement of Mr. L.”</p></div>

<p>The writer then deplores Miss Guard’s fall
from virtue, and her desertion by her betrayer,
“on account of her fortune being small.”
Capt. Lawson, or Mr. James Lawless, next
woos a wealthy City maiden, and the banns are
published. What follows seems to me to be a
rather intricate <span class="lock">detail:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We find that the intended bride learned that <span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>iss
Guard, held certain promissory letters of his, and that
she was determined to enter an action against him for
a breach of promise, which moved clouded Eclipse
over the extacy of the variable miss Lawless who knew
that Miss G had Letters of his sufficient to substantiate
her claims in a court.”</p></div>

<p>Lawson visits Miss Guard to wheedle her
out of his letters, but “she drew a large
carving-knife and stabbed him under the left
breast.” At the latest account the man was
left without hope of recovery, while “the
valiant victress” was “ordered to submit to
judicial decorum in the nineteenth year of her
age.” The murders and other atrocities for
which this “cock” has been sponsor, are&mdash;I
was informed emphatically&mdash;a thundering lot!</p>

</div>

<p>I conclude with another cock, which may be
called a narrative “on a subject,” as we have
“ballads on a subject” (afterwards to be described),
but with this difference, that the narrative
is fictitious, and the ballad must be founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
on a real event, however embellished. The
highest newspaper style, I was told, was aimed
at. Part of the production reads as if it had
done service during the Revolution of February,
1848.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have most important intelligence from Paris.
That capital is in a state of insurrection. The vivacious
people, who have herefore defeated the goverment
by paving-stones, have again taken up those

proclamation warning the people to respect the laws,
which he declared were violated, and he meant to
enforce them. But the people dispised the proclamation
and rejected his authority. They assembled in
great multitudes round the Chambers of Deputies,
and forced their way over the walls. They were
attacked by the troops and dispersed, but, re-assembled
in various quarters. They showed their hatred of M.
Guizot by demolishing his windows and attempting to
force an entrance into his hotel, but were again
repulced by the troops. All the military in Paris,
and all the National Guard, have been summoned to
arms, and every preparation made on the part of the
government to put down the people.</p>

authenticity, any further information as soon as obtained
shall be immediately announced to the public.”</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Strawing.”</span></h3>

<p>I have already alluded to “strawing,” which
can hardly be described as quackery. It is
rather a piece of mountebankery. Many a
quack&mdash;confining the term to its most common
signification, that of a “quack doctor”&mdash;has
faith in the excellence of his own nostrums,
and so proffers that which he believes to be
curative: the strawer, however, sells what he
<i>knows</i> is not what he represents it.</p>

<p>The strawer offers to <i>sell</i> any passer by in
the streets a straw and to <i>give</i> the purchaser a
paper which he <i>dares not</i> sell. Accordingly as
he judges of the character of his audience, so he
intimates that the paper is political, libellous,
irreligious, or indecent.</p>

<p>I am told that as far back as twenty-five or
twenty-six years, straws were sold, but only in
the country, with leaves from the <i>Republican</i>, a
periodical published by Carlile, then of Fleet-street,
which had been prosecuted by the government;
but it seems that the trade died away,
and was little or hardly known again until the
time of the trial of Queen Caroline, and then
but sparingly. The straw sale reached its
highest commercial pitch at the era of the
Reform Bill. The most successful trader in
the article is remembered among the patterers
as “Jack Straw,” who was oft enough represented
to me as the original strawer. If I
inquired further, the answer was: “He was the
first in my time.” This Jack Straw was, I
am told, a fine-looking man, a natural son of
Henry Hunt, the blacking manufacturer. He
was described to me as an inveterate drunkard
and a very reckless fellow. One old hand was
certain that this man was Hunt’s son, as he
himself had “worked” with him, and was
sometimes sent by him when he was “in trouble,”
or in any strait, to 32, Broadwall, Blackfriars,
for assistance, which was usually rendered.
(This was the place where Hunt’s
“Matchless Blacking” and “Roasted Corn”
were vended.) Jack Straw’s principal “pitch”
was at Hyde Park Corner, “where,” said the
man whom I have mentioned as working with
him, “he used to come it very strong against
Old Nosey, the Hyde Park bully as he called
him. To my knowledge he’s made 10<i>s.</i>, and
he’s made 15<i>s.</i> on a night. O, it didn’t matter
to him what he sold with his straws, religion or
anything. There was no three-pennies (threepenny
newspapers) then, and he had had a
gentleman’s education, and knew what to say,
and so the straws went off like smoke.” The
articles which this man “durst not sell” were
done up in paper, so that no one could very well
peruse them on the spot, as a sort of stealth
was implied. On my asking Jack Straw’s co-worker
if he had ever drank with him, “Drank
with him!” he answered, “Yes, many a
time. I’ve gone out and pattered, or chaunted,
or anything, to get money to buy him two
glasses of brandy&mdash;and good brandy was very
dear then&mdash;before he could start, for he was all
of a tremble until he had his medicine. If
I couldn’t get brandy, it was the best rum,
’cause he had all the tastes of a gentleman.
Ah! he’s been dead some years, sir, but where
he died I don’t know. I only heard of his
death. He was a nice kindly fellow.”</p>

<p>The <i>ruse</i> in respect of strawing is not remarkable
for its originality. It was an old smuggler’s
trick to <i>sell</i> a sack and <i>give</i> the keg of
contraband spirit placed within it and padded
out with straw so as to resemble a sack of corn.
The hawkers, prior to 1826, when Mr. Huskisson
introduced changes into the Silk Laws, <i>gave</i>
“real Ingy handkerchiefs” (sham) to a customer,
and <i>sold</i> him a knot of tape for about 4<i>s.</i>
The price of a true Bandana, then prohibited,
and sold openly in the draper’s shops, was about
8<i>s.</i> The East India Company imported about
a million of Bandanas yearly; they were sold by
auction for exportation to Hamburgh, &amp;c., at
about 4<i>s.</i> each, and were nearly all smuggled
back again to England, and disposed of as I
have stated.</p>

<p>It is not possible to give anything like statistics
as to the money realised by strawing. A
well-informed man calculated that when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
trade was at its best, or from 1832 to 1836,
there might be generally fifty working it in the
country and twenty in London; they did not
confine themselves, however, to strawing, but
resorted to it only on favourable opportunities.
Now there are none in London&mdash;their numbers
diminished gradually&mdash;and very rarely any in
the country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sham Indecent Street-trade.</span></h3>

<p>This is one of those callings which are at once
repulsive and ludicrous; repulsive, when it is
considered under what pretences the papers are
sold, and ludicrous, when the disappointment of
the gulled purchaser is contemplated.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that one of the allurements
held out by the strawer was that his paper&mdash;the
words used by Jack Straw&mdash;could “not be admitted
into families.” Those following the
“sham indecent trade” for a time followed his
example, and professed to sell straws and give
away papers; but the London police became
very observant of the sale of straws&mdash;more especially
under the pretences alluded to&mdash;and it
has, for the last ten years, been rarely pursued
in the streets.</p>

<p>The plan now adopted is to sell the sealed
packet itself, which the “patter” of the street-seller
leads his auditors to believe to be
some improper or scandalous publication. The
packet is some coloured paper, in which is
placed a portion of an old newspaper, a Christmas
carol, a religious tract, or a slop-tailor’s
puff (given away in the streets for the behoof
of another class of gulls). The enclosed paper
is, however, never indecent.</p>

<p>From a man who had, not long ago, been in
this trade, I had the following account. He was
very anxious that nothing should be said which
would lead to a knowledge that he was my informant.
After having expressed his sorrow
that he had ever been driven to this trade from
distress, he proceeded to justify himself. He
argued&mdash;and he was not an ignorant man&mdash;that
there was neither common sense nor common
justice in interfering with a man like him, who,
“to earn a crust, pretended to sell what <i>shop-keepers</i>,
that must pay church and all sorts of
rates, sold without being molested.” The word
“shopkeepers” was uttered with a bitter emphasis.
There are, or were, he continued, shops&mdash;for
he seemed to know them all&mdash;and some of
them had been carried on for years, in which
shameless publications were not only sold, but
exposed in the windows; and why should he be
considered a greater offender than a shopkeeper,
and be knocked about by the police? There
are, or lately were, he said, such shops in the
Strand, Fleet-street, a court off Ludgate-hill,
Holborn, Drury-lane, Wych-street, the courts
near Drury-lane Theatre, Haymarket, High-street,
Bloomsbury, St. Martin’s-court, May’s
buildings, and elsewhere, to say nothing of
Holywell-street! Yet <i>he</i> must be interfered with!</p>

<p>[I may here remark, that I met with no
street-sellers who did not disbelieve, or affect to
disbelieve, that they were really meddled with
by the police for obstructing the thoroughfare.
They either hint, or plainly state, that they are
removed solely to please the shop-keepers.
Such was the reiterated opinion, real or pretended,
of my present informant.]</p>

<p>I took a statement from this man, but do not
care to dwell upon the subject. The trade, in
the form I have described, had been carried on,
he thought, for the last six years. At one time,
20 men followed it; at present, he believed
there were only 6, and they worked only at
intervals, and as opportunities offered: some
going out, for instance, to sell almanacs or memorandum
books, and, when they met with a
favourable chance, offering their sealed packets.
My informant’s customers were principally
boys, young men, and old gentlemen; but old
gentlemen chiefly when the trade was new.
This street-seller’s “great gun,” as he called
it, was to make up packets, as closely resembling
as he could accomplish it, those which
were displayed in the windows of any of the
shops I have alluded to. He would then station
himself at some little distance from one of
those shops, and, if possible, so as to encounter
those who had stopped to study the contents of
the window, and would represent&mdash;broadly
enough, he admitted, when he dared&mdash;that he
could sell for 6<i>d.</i> what was charged 5<i>s.</i>, or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
or whatever price he had seen announced, “in
that very neighbourhood.” He sometimes ventured,
also, to mutter something, unintelligibly,
about the public being imposed upon! On one
occasion, he took 6<i>s.</i> in the street in about two
hours. On another evening he took 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in
the street and was called aside by two old gentlemen,
each of whom told him to come to an
address given (at the West-end), and ask for such
and such initials. To one he sold two packets
for 2<i>s.</i>; to the other, five packets, each 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;or
11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in one evening. The packets were in
different coloured papers, and had the impressions
of a large seal on red wax at the back; and
he assured the old gents., as he called them, one
of whom, he thought, was “silly,” that they
were all different. “And very likely,” he said,
chucklingly, “they were different; for they
were made out of a lot of missionary tracts
and old newspapers that I got dirt cheap at a
‘waste’ shop. I should like to have seen the
old gent.’s face, as he opened his 5<i>s.</i> worth,
one after another!” This trade, however,
among old gentlemen, was prosperous for
barely a month: “It got blown then, sir, and
they wouldn’t buy any more, except a very
odd one.”</p>

<p>This man&mdash;and he believed it was the same
with all the others in the trade&mdash;never visited
the public-houses, for a packet would soon
have been opened and torn there, which, he
said, people was ashamed to do in the public
streets. As well as he could recollect, he had
never sold a single packet to a girl or a woman.
Drunken women of the town had occasionally
made loud comments on his calling, and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to purchase; but on such occasions, fearful of
a disturbance, he always hurried away.</p>

<p>I have said that the straw trade is now confined
to the country, and I give a specimen of
the article vended there, by the patterer in the
sham indecent trade. It was purchased of a
man, who sold it folded in the form of a letter,
and is addressed, “On Royal Service. By Express.
Private. To Her Royal Highness, Victoria,
Princess Royal. Kensington Palace,
London. Entered at Stationer’s Hall.” The
man who sold it had a wisp of straw round his
neck, and introduced his wares with the following
patter:</p>

<p>“I am well aware that many persons here
present will say what an absurd idea&mdash;the idea
of selling straws for a halfpenny each, when
there are so many lying about the street; but
the reason is simply this: I am not allowed by
the authorities to sell these papers, so I give
them away and sell my straws. There are a
variety of figures in these papers for gentlemen;
some in the bed, some on the bed, some under
the bed.” The following is a copy of the document
thus <span class="lock">sold:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest Victoria</span>,</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;never did I enjoy greater bliss, than when I sat
down to the delightful task of writing a love letter to thy
royal highness&mdash;my sweetest angel, oh! how I do adore
thy lovely form, and long for the happy hour when I shall
clasp thee in my arms&mdash;My bosom heaves, my heart pants,
my senses wander, my hair stands on end, my head is on
fire, my feet stumbles&mdash;yea, my arms and my legs refuse
to do their office; every one of my members are tantalised
with varied and conflicting emotions, and my
whole body is being consumed in the furnase of everlasting
love! Then hasten my glorious cherub&mdash;thou heavenly
samaritan, pass not away from thy adoring albert;
but come and pour thy healing balsam into my smarting
wounds&mdash;Then will I pleasantly repose myself on my
<i>now</i> sleepless couch, and resining my soul to the enjoyment
of that balmy sleep I have been long wanting, I
shall be enchanted with the most beautiful visions of
futurity, and continue to dream of love and thee! My
amiable Victoria, the most pure and spotless of virgins,
come to my longing arams&mdash;it is only thy dear Albert
who like a bird of paradise, is calling thee to listen to his
charming notes, and with fluttering wings wishes to
bury himself within thy own downy plumage! Most
amiable of England’s princesses&mdash;and the most virtuous
of all heirs to a british diadem&mdash;I implore thee on ny
bended knees, to favour my suit, above any other prince
in christendom; and when thou hast deigned to exhalt
me to that envied station of being thy husband, rest assured
on my princely honour, that I will award to my
royal bride and future sovereign, very many and living
pledges of affection&mdash;anxiously awaiting your royal-Highnesses’
answer, I beg leave to subscribe myself</p>

“<span class="smcap">Prince of Coburg.</span>”
</p></div>

<p>On the back of this page is the following cool
initiation of the purchaser into the mysteries of
the epistle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Directions for the purchasers to understand the
<i>Royal Love Letters</i>, and showing them how to practise
the art of Secret Letter <span class="lock">Writing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Proceed to lay open ‘Albert’s Letter’ by the side
of ‘Victoria’s,’ and having done so, then look carefully
down them until you have come to a word at the left
hand corner, near the end of each Letter, having two
marks thus &mdash; &mdash;, when you must commence with that
word, and read from left to right after you have turned
them bottom upwards before a looking glass so that you
may peruse the copy reflected therein. But you must
notice, throughout all the words every other letter is
upside down, also every other word single; but the
next two words being purposely joined together, therefore
they are double; and in addition to those letters
placed upside down, makes it more mysterious in the
reading. The reader is recommended to copy each
word in writing, when he will be able to read the letters
forward, and after a little practice he can soon learn to
form all his words in the same curious manner, when
he wants to write a ‘secret letter.’</p>

<p>“Be sure when holding it up side down before a
looking-glass, that the light of a candle, is placed between
then by the reflection it will show much plainer,
and be sooner discovered.</p>

<p>“If you intend to practise a <i>Joke</i> and make it answer
the purpose of a Valentine, write what you think necessary
on the adjoining <i>blank page</i>; then post it, with
the superscription filled up in this manner:&mdash;After
the word To, <i>write the name and address of the party</i>
also place the word FROM <i>before</i> ‘VICTORIA’S’
name: then the address on the outside of this letter
will read somewhat after the following fashion:&mdash;To
Mr. or Mrs. so and so, (with the number if any,) in such
and such a street: at the same time your letter will
appear as if it came from Royalty.</p>

<p>“N.B. You must first buy both the letters, as the
other letter is an answer to this one; and because,
without the reader has got both letters, he will not
have the secrets perfect.”</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the injunction to buy <i>both</i>
letters, and the seeming necessity of having both
to understand the “directions,” the patterer was
selling only the one I have given.</p>

<p>That the trade in sham indecent publications
was, at one time, very considerable, and was not
unobserved by those who watch, as it is called,
“the signs of the times,” is shown by the circumstance
that the Anti-Corn-Law League
paper, called the <i>Bread Basket</i>, could only be
got off by being done up in a sealed packet, and
sold by patterers as a pretended improper work.</p>

<p>The really indecent trade will be described
hereafter.</p>

<p>For a month my informant thought he had
cleared 35<i>s.</i> a week; for another month, 20<i>s.</i>;
and as an average, since that time, from 5<i>s.</i> to
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, until he discontinued the trade.
It is very seldom practised, unless in the evening,
and perhaps only one street-seller depends
entirely upon it.</p>

<p>Supposing that 6 men last year each cleared
6<i>s.</i> weekly, we find upwards of 93<i>l.</i> expended
yearly in the streets on this rubbish.</p>

<p>The capital required to start in the business
is 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i>, to be expended in paper, paste, and
sometimes sealing-wax.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Religious Tract Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>The sellers of religious tracts are now, I am
informed, at the least, about 50, but they were
at one time, far more numerous. When penny
books were few and very small, religious tracts
were by far the cheapest things in print. It is
common, moreover, for a religious society, or
an individual, to give a poor person, children
especially, tracts for sale. A great many tract
sellers, from 25 to 35 years ago, were, or pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>tended
to be, maimed old soldiers or sailors.
The traffic is now in the hands of what may be
called an anomalous body of men. More than
one half of the tract sellers are foreigners, such
as Malays, Hindoos, and Negros. Of them,
some cannot speak English, and some&mdash;who
earn a spare subsistence by selling Christian
tracts&mdash;are Mahometans, or worshippers of
Bramah! The man whose portrait supplies
the daguerreotyped illustration of this number
is unable to speak a word of English, and the
absence of an interpreter, through some accident,
prevented his statement being taken at the
time appointed. I shall give it, however, with
the necessary details on the subject, under
another head.</p>

<p>With some men and boys, I am informed,
tract-selling is but a pretext for begging.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Benefit Society of Patterers.</span></h3>

<p>In the course of my inquiries, I received an
account of an effort made by a body of these
people to provide against sickness,&mdash;a step so
clearly in the right direction, and perhaps so
little to be expected from the habits of the class,
that I feel bound to notice it. It was called
the “Street-sellers’ Society;” but as nearly all
the <i>bonâ-fide</i> members (or those who sought
benefit from its funds) were patterers in paper,
or ballad-singers, I can most appropriately
notice their proceedings here.</p>

<p>The society “sprung up accidental,” as it
was expressed to me. A few paper-workers
were conversing of the desirableness of such an
institution, and one of the body suggested a
benefit club, which it was at once determined to
establish. It was accordingly established between
six and seven years ago, and was carried
on for about four years. The members varied
in number from 40 to 50; but of a proportion
of 40, as many as 18 might be tradesmen who
were interested in the street-trade, either in
supplying the articles in demand for it, or from
keeping public-houses resorted to by the fraternity,
or any such motive, or who were merely
curious to mix in such society. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; was
conductor; Mr. J. H&mdash;&mdash; (a poet, and the writer
of “Black Bess,” “the Demon of the Sea,” and
other things which “took” in the streets), secretary;
and a well-known patterer was under-conductor,
with which office was mixed up the
rather onerous duties of a kind of master of the
ceremonies on meeting-nights. None of the
officers were paid.</p>

<p>The subscription was 2<i>d.</i> a week, and meetings
of the members were held once a week.
Each member, not an officer, paid &frac12;<i>d.</i> for admission
to the fund, and could introduce a
visitor, who also paid &frac12;<i>d.</i> No charge was made
for the use of the club-room (in a public-house),
which was entirely in the control of the members.
Every one using bad language, or behaving
improperly, was fined &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and on a
second offence was ejected, and sometimes, if
the misbehaviour was gross, on the first. Any
one called upon to sing, and refusing, or being
unable, was fined &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and was liable to be
called upon again, and pay another fine. A
visitor sometimes, instead of &frac12;<i>d.</i>, offered 6<i>d.</i>
when fined; but this was not accepted,&mdash;only
&frac12;<i>d.</i> could be received. The members’ wives
could and did often accompany their husbands
to the meetings; but women of the town, whether
introduced by members or not, were not
permitted to remain. “They found their way
in a few times,” said the man who was under-conductor
to me, “but I managed to work them
out without any bother, and without insulting
them&mdash;God forbid!”</p>

<p>The assistance given was 5<i>s.</i> weekly to sick
members, who were not in arrear in their subscriptions.
If the man had a family to support,
a gathering was made for him, in addition to his
weekly allowance,&mdash;for the members were averse
to “distress the box” (fund). There was no
allowance for the burial of a member, but a
gathering took place, and perhaps a raffle, to
raise funds for a wake (sometimes) and an interment;
and during the existence of the society,
three members, I was told, were buried that
way “comfortably.” The subscriptions were
paid up regularly enough; “indeed,” said a
member to me, “if a man earned anything, his
mates knew of it: we all know how the cat
jumps that way, so he must either pay or be
scratched.” The members not unfrequently lent
each other money to pay up their subscriptions.
Fashionable young “swells,” I was told, often
visited the house, and stayed till 3 or 4 in the
morning, but were very seldom in the club-room,
which was closed regularly at 12. After that hour,
the “swells” who were bent upon seeing life&mdash;(and
they are a class whom the patterers, on
all such occasions, not so very unreasonably
consider “fair game” for bamboozling)&mdash;could
enjoy the society congenial to their tastes or
gratifying to their curiosity. On one occasion
two policemen were among the visitors, and
were on friendly terms enough with the members,
some of whom they had seen before.</p>

<p>From the beginning there seems to have been
a distrust of one another among the members,
but a distrust not invincible or the club would
never have been formed. Instead of the
“box,” or fund (the money being deposited in
a box), being allowed to accumulate, so that an
investment might be realised, available for any
emergency, the fund was divided among the
members quarterly, and then the subscription
went on anew. The payments, however, fell
off. The calling of the members was precarious,
their absence in the country was frequent,
and so the society ceased to exist, but the members
were satisfied that every thing was done
honourably.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>The purpose to which the funds, on a quarterly
division, were devoted, was one not confined
to such men as the patterers&mdash;to a supper.
“None of your light suppers, sir,” said a member;
“not by no means. And we were too fly
to send anybody to market but ourselves. We
used to go to Leadenhall, and buy a cut off a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
sirloin, which was roasted prime, and smelt like
a angel. But not so often, for its a dear jint,
the bones is heavy. One of the favouritest jints
was a boiled leg of mutton with caper trimmings.
That <i>is</i> a good supper,&mdash;I believe you,
my hero.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Abodes, Tricks, Marriage, Character,
and Characteristics of the
Different Grades of Patterers.</span></h3>

<p>Having now giving an account of those who
may be called the literary patterers (proper), or
at any rate of those who do not deem it vain so
to account themselves, because they “work
paper,” I proceed to adduce an account of
the different grades of patterers generally, for
patter has almost as many divisions as literature.
There is patter pathetic, as from beggars;
bouncing, to puff off anything of little
or no value; comic, as by the clowns; descriptive,
as in the cases where the vendor describes,
however ornately, what he really sells; religious,
as occasionally by the vendors of tracts;
<i>real patter</i> (as it is understood by the profession)
to make a thing believed to be what it is
not; classical, as in the case of the sale of
stenographic cards, &amp;c.; and sporting, as in race
cards.</p>

<p>The pattering tribe is by no means confined
to the traffic in paper, though it may be the
principal calling as regards the acuteness of its
professors. Among these street-folk are the
running and standing patterers (or stationers
as they are sometimes, but rarely, styled)&mdash;and
in these are included, the Death and Fire
Hunters of whom I have spoken; Chaunters;
Second Edition-sellers; Reciters; Conundrum-sellers;
Board-workers; Strawers; Sellers of
(Sham) Indecent Publications; Street Auctioneers;
Cheap Jacks; Mountebanks (quacks);
Clowns; the various classes of Showmen;
Jugglers; Conjurors; Ring-sellers for wagers;
Sovereign-sellers; Corn-curers; Grease-removers;
French-polishers; Blacking-sellers;
Nostrum-vendors; Fortune-tellers; Oratorical-beggars;
Turnpike-sailors; the classes of
Lurkers; Stenographic Card-sellers, and the
Vendors of Race-cards or lists.</p>

<p>The following accounts have been written for
me by the same gentleman who has already
described the Religion, Morals, &amp;c., of patterers.
He has for some years resided among
the class, and has pursued a street calling for
his existence. What I have already said of his
opportunities of personal observation and of dispassionate
judgment I need not iterate.</p>

<p>“I wish,” says the writer in question, “in the
disclosures I am now about to make concerning
the patterers generally, to <i>do more</i> than
merely put the public on their guard. I take
no cruel delight in dragging forth the follies of
my fellow-men. Before I have done with my
subject, I hope to draw forth and exhibit some
of the latent virtues of the class under notice,
many of whom I know to sigh in secret over
that <i>one</i> imprudent step (whatever its description),
which has furnished the censorious with
a weapon they have been but too ready to
wield. The first thing for me to do is to give
a glance at the <i>habitations</i> of these outcasts,
and to set forth their usual conduct, opinions,
conversation and amusements. As London (including
the ten mile circle), is the head quarters
of lodging-house life, and least known,
because most crowded, I shall lift the veil
which shrouds the vagrant hovel where the
patterer usually resides.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“As there are many individuals in lodging-houses
who are not regular patterers or professional
vagrants, being rather, as they term
themselves, ‘travellers’ (or tramps), so there
are multitudes who do <i>not</i> inhabit such houses
who really belong to the fraternity, pattering,
or vagrant. Of these some take up their abode
in what they call ‘flatty-kens,’ that is, houses
the landlord of which is not ‘awake’ or ‘fly’
to the ‘moves’ and dodges of the trade; others
resort to the regular ‘padding-kens,’ or houses
of call for vagabonds; while others&mdash;and especially
those who have families&mdash;live constantly
in furnished rooms, and have little intercourse
with the ‘regular’ travellers, tramps, or
wanderers.</p>

<p>“The medium houses the London vagrant
haunts, (for I have no wish to go to extremes
either way,) are probably in Westminster, and
perhaps the fairest ‘model’ of the ‘<i>monkry</i>’ is
the house in Orchard-street&mdash;once the residence
of royalty&mdash;which has been kept and conducted
for half a century by the veteran who some fifty
years ago was the <i>only</i> man who amused the
population with that well-known ditty,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘If I’d as much money as I could tell,</div>
       <div class="verse">I would not cry young lambs to sell.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Mister</i> (for that is the old man’s title) still
manufactures lambs, but seldom goes out himself;
his sons (obedient and exemplary young
men) take the toys into the country, and dispose
of them at fairs and markets. The wife of this
man is a woman of some beauty and good sound
sense, but far too credulous for the position of
which she is the mistress.</p>

<p>“So much for the establishment. I have now
to deal with the inmates.</p>

<p>“No one could be long an inmate of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;’s without discerning in the motley group
persons who had seen better days, and, seated
on the same bench, persons who are ‘seeing’
the best days they <i>ever</i> saw. When I took up
my abode in the house under consideration, I
was struck by the appearance of a middle-aged
lady-like woman, a native of Worcester, bred to
the glove trade, and brought up in the lap of
plenty, and under the high sanction of religious
principle. She had evidently some source of
mental anguish. I believe it was the conduct
of her husband, by whom she had been deserted,
and who was living with a woman to whom, it
is said, the wife had shown much kindness. By
her sat a giant in size, and candour demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
that I should say a ‘giant in sin.’ When Navy
Jem, as he is called, used to <i>work</i> for his living
(it was a long while ago) he drove a barrow at
the formation of the Great Western Railway.
At present the man lies in bed till mid-day, and
when he makes his appearance in the kitchen,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘The very kittens on the hearth</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">They dare not even play.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His breakfast embraces all the good things of
the season. He divides his delicacies with a
silver fork&mdash;where did he get it? The mode in
which this man obtains a livelihood is at once a
mixture and a mystery. His prevailing plan is
to waylay gentlemen in the decline of life,
and to extort money by threats of accusation
and exposure, to which I can do no more than
allude. His wife, a notorious shoplifter, is now
for the third time ‘expiating her offences’ in
Coldbath-fields.</p>

<p>“Next to Navy Jem may be perceived a little
stunted woman, of pretended Scotch, but really
Irish extraction, whose husband has died in the
hospital for consumption at least as many times
as the hero of Waterloo has seen engagements.
At last the man <i>did</i> die, and his widow has been
collecting money to bury him for eight years
past, but has not yet secured the required sum.
This woman, whose name I never knew, has a
boy and a girl; to the former she is very kind,
the latter she beats without mercy, always before
breakfast, and with such (almost) unvaried
punctuality that her brother will sometimes
whisper (after saying grace), ‘Mother, has our
Poll had her licks yet?’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Among the records of mortality lately before
the public, is the account of a notorious woman,
who was found suffocated in a stagnant pool,
whether from suicide or accident it was impossible
to determine. She had been in every
hospital in town and country, suffering from a
disease, entirely self-procured. She applied
strong acids to wounds previously punctured
with a pin, and so caused her body to present
one mass of sores. She was deemed incurable
by the hospital doctors, and liberal collections
were made for her among the benevolent in
various places. The trick, however, was ultimately
discovered, and the failure of her plan
(added to the bad state of health to which her
bodily injuries had gradually led) preyed upon
her mind and hastened her death.</p>

<p>“This woman had been the paramour of
‘Peter the crossing-sweeper,’ a man who
for years went about showing similar wounds,
which he pretended had been inflicted while
fighting in the Spanish Legion&mdash;though, truth
to say, he had never been nearer Spain than
Liverpool is to New York. He had followed
the ‘monkry’ from a child, and chiefly, since
manhood, as a ‘broken-down weaver from
Leicester,’ and after singing through every
one of the provinces ‘We’ve got no work to
do,’ he scraped acquaintance with a ‘school
of shallow coves;’ that is, men who go about
half-naked, telling frightful tales about shipwrecks,
hair-breadth escapes from houses on
fire, and such like aqueous and igneous calamities.
By these Peter was initiated into the
‘<i>scaldrum dodge</i>,’ or the art of burning the
body with a mixture of acids and gunpowder,
so as to suit the hues and complexions of the
accident to be deplored. Such persons hold
every morning a ‘committee of ways and
means,’ according to whose decision the movements
of the day are carried out. Sometimes
when on their country rounds, they go singly
up to the houses of the gentry and wealthy
farmers, begging shirts, which they hide in
hedges while they go to another house and
beg a similar article. Sometimes they go
in crowds, to the number of from twelve to
twenty; they are most successful when the
‘swell’ is not at home; if they can meet with
the ‘Burerk’ (Mistress), or the young ladies,
they ‘put it on them for dunnage’ (beg a
stock of general clothing), flattering their victims
first and frightening them afterwards. A
friend of mine was present in a lodging-house
in Plymouth, when a school of the shallow
coves returned from their day’s work with <i>six
suits of clothes, and twenty-seven shirts, besides
children’s apparel and shoes</i>, (all of which were
sold to a broker in the same street), and, besides
these, the donations in money received amounted
to 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a man.</p>

<p>“At this enterprise ‘Peter’ continued several
years, but&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;‘everything
has but a time,’ the country got ‘dead’
to him, and people got ‘fly’ to the ‘shallow
brigade;’ so Peter came up to London to ‘try
his hand at something else.’ Housed in the
domicile of ‘Sayer the barber,’ who has enriched
himself by beer-shops and lodging-house-keeping,
to the tune it is said of 20,000<i>l.</i>,
Peter amused the ‘travellers’ of Wentworth-street,
Whitechapel, with recitals of what he
had seen and done. Here a profligate, but
rather intelligent man, who had really been in
the service of the Queen of Spain, gave him an
old red jacket, and with it such instructions as
equipped him for the imposition. One sleeve
of this jacket usually hung loosely by his side,
while the arm it should have covered was exposed
naked, and to all appearance withered.
His rule was to keep silence till a crowd assembled
around him, when he began to ‘<i>patter</i>’
to them to the following effect: ‘Ladies and
gentlemen, it is with feelings of no common
reluctance that I stand before you at this time;
but although I am not without <i>feelings</i>, I am
totally without friends, and frequently without
food. This wound (showing his disfigured arm)
I received in the service of the Queen of Spain,
and I have many more on different parts of my
person. I received a little praise for my brave
conduct, but not a penny of pension, and here
I am (there’s no deception you see) ill in
health&mdash;poor in pocket, and exposed without
proper nourishment to wind and weather&mdash;the
cold is blowing through me till I am almost
perished.’ His ‘<i>Doxy</i>’ stood by and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the ‘voluntary contributions’ of the audience
in a soldier’s cap, which our hero emptied into
his pocket, and after snivelling out his thanks,
departed to renew the exhibition in the nearest
available thoroughfare. Peter boasted that he
could make on an average fifteen of these
pitches a day, and as the proceeds were estimated
at something considerable in each pitch
(he has been known to take as much as half-a-crown
in pence at one standing), he was able
to sport his figure at Astley’s in the evening&mdash;to
eat ‘spring lamb,’ and when reeling home
under the influence of whiskey, to entertain the
peaceful inhabitants with the music of&mdash;‘We
won’t go home till morning&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“Whether the <i>game</i> got <i>stale</i>, or Peter became
honest, is beyond the purport of my communication
to settle. If any reader, however,
should make his purchases at the puffing fishmonger’s
in Lombard-street, they may find
Peter now pursuing the more honest occupation
of sweeping the crossing, by the church
of St. Gabriel, Fenchurch-street.</p>

<p>“Among the most famous of the ‘lurking
patterers’ was ‘Captain Moody,’ the son of
poor but honest parents in the county of Cornwall,
who died during his boyhood, leaving him
to the custody of a maiden aunt. This lady
soon, and not without reason, got tired of her
incorrigible charge. Young Moody was apprenticed
successively to three trades, and
wanted not ability to become expert in any of
them, but having occasional interviews with some
of the gipsey tribe, and hearing from themselves
of their wonderful achievements, he left the
sober walks of life and joined this vagrant
fraternity.</p>

<p>“His new position, however, was attractive only
while it was novel. Moody, who had received
a fair education, soon became disgusted with
the coarseness and vulgarity of his associates.
At the solicitation of a neighbouring clergyman,
he was restored to the friendship of his
aunt, who had soon sad reason to regret that her
compassion had got the better of her prudence;
for one Sunday afternoon, while she was absent
at church, young Moody who had pleaded indisposition
and so obtained permission to stay
at home, decamped (after dispatching the servant
to the town, a mile distant, to fetch the
doctor) in the meantime, emptying his aunt’s
‘safety cupboard’ of a couple of gold watches
and £72 in cash and country notes.</p>

<p>“His roving disposition then induced him to
try the sea, and the knowledge he obtained
during several voyages fitted him for those
maritime frauds which got him the name of
‘Captain Moody, the lurker.’ The frauds of
this person are well known, and often recounted
with great admiration among the pattering fraternity.
On one occasion, the principal butcher
in Gosport was summoned to meet a gentlemen
at an hotel. The <i>Louisa</i>, a brig, had just arrived
at Portsmouth, the captain’s name was
Young, and this gentleman Moody personated
for the time being. ‘I have occasion,’ said he
to the butcher, ‘for an additional supply of
beef for the <i>Louisa</i>; I have heard you spoken
of by Captain Harrison’ (whom Moody knew to
be an old friend of the butcher’s), ‘and I have
thus given you the preference. I want a bullock,
cut up in 12lb. pieces; it must be on
board by three to-morrow.’ The price was
agreed upon, and the captain threw down a few
sovereigns in payment, but, of course, discovered
that he had not gold enough to cover the
whole amount, so he proposed to give him a
cheque he had just received from Captain Harrison
for £100, and the butcher could give him the
difference. The tradesman was nothing loth,
for a cheque upon ‘Vallance, Mills, and West,’
with Captain Harrison’s signature, was reckoned
equal to money any day, and so the butcher
considered the one he had received, until the
next morning, when the draft and the order
proved to be forgeries. The culprit was, of
course, nowhere to be found, nor, indeed, heard
of till two years after, when he had removed the
scene of his depredations to Liverpool.</p>

<p>“In that port he had a colleague, a man whose
manners and appearance were equally prepossessing.
Moody sent his ‘pal’ into a jeweller’s
shop, near the corner of Lord-street, who there
purchased a small gold seal, paid for it, and took
his leave. Immediately afterwards, Moody entered
the shop under evident excitement, declaring
that he had seen the person, who had just
left the shop secrete two, if not three, seals up
his coat-sleeve; adding, that the fellow had just
gone through the Exchange, and that if the
jeweller were quick he would be sure to catch
him. The jeweller ran out without his hat,
leaving his kind friend in charge of the shop,
and soon returned with the supposed criminal in
his custody. The ‘captain,’ however, in the
mean time, had decamped, taking with him a
tray from the window, containing precious materials
to the value of 300<i>l.</i></p>

<p>“At another time, the ‘captain’ prepared a
document, setting forth ‘losses in the Baltic
trade,’ and a dismal variety of disasters; and
concluding with a melancholy shipwreck, which
had really taken place just about that time in
the German Ocean. With this he travelled over
great part of Scotland, and with almost unprecedented
success. Journeying near the Frith of
Forth, he paid a visit to Lord Dalmeny&mdash;a
nobleman of great benevolence&mdash;who had read
the account of the shipwreck in the local journals,
and wondered that the petition was not
signed by influential persons <i>on the spot</i>; and,
somewhat suspicious of the reality of the ‘captain’s’
identity, placed a terrestrial globe before
him, and begged to be shown ‘in what latitude
he was cast away.’ The awkwardness with
which Moody handled the globe showed that
<i>he</i> was ‘out of <i>his</i> latitude’ altogether. His
lordship thereupon committed the document to
the flames, but generously gave the ‘captain’ a
sovereign and some good advice; the former he
appropriated at the nearest public-house, of the
latter he never made the least use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Old, and worn out by excesses and imprisonment,
he subsists now by ‘sitting pad’ about
the suburban pavements; and when, on a recent
evening, he was recognised in a low public-house
in Deptford, he was heard to say, with
a sigh: ‘Ah! once I could “screeve a fakement”
(write a petition) or “cooper a monekur”
(forge a signature) with any man alive,
and my heart’s game now; but I’m old and
asthmatic, and got the rheumatis, so that I ain’t
worth a d&mdash;n.’</p>

<p>“‘The Lady Lurker.’&mdash;Of this person very
little is known, and <i>that</i> little, it is said, makes
her an object of pity. Her father was a dissenting
minister in Bedfordshire. She has been
twice married; her first husband was a schoolmaster
at Hackney, and nephew of a famous
divine who wrote a Commentary on the Bible,
and was chaplain to George III. She afterwards
married a physician in Cambridgeshire (a
Dr. S&mdash;&mdash;), who is alleged to have treated her
ill, and even to have attempted to poison her.
She has no children; and, since the death of
her husband, has passed through various grades,
till she is now a cadger. She dresses becomingly
in black, and sends in her card (Mrs. Dr. S&mdash;&mdash;)
to the houses whose occupants are known, or
supposed, to be charitable. She talks with them
for a certain time, and then draws forth a few
boxes of lucifers, which, she says, she is compelled
to sell for her living. These lucifers are
merely excuses, of course, for begging; still,
nothing is known to have ever transpired in her
behaviour wholly unworthy of a distressed gentlewoman.
She lives in private lodgings.”</p>

<p>I continue the account of these habitations,
and of their wretched occupants, from the pen
of the same gentleman whose vicissitudes (partly
self-procured) led him to several years’ acquaintance
with the subject.</p>

<p>“Padding-kens” (lodging-houses) in the country
are certainly preferable abodes to those of
St. Giles’s, Westminster, or Whitechapel; but in
country as in town, their condition is extremely
filthy and disgusting; many of them are scarcely
ever washed, and as to sweeping, once a week is
miraculous. In most cases they swarm with
vermin, and, except where their position is
very airy, the ventilation is imperfect, and frequent
sickness the necessary result. It is a
matter of surprise that the nobility, clergy, and
gentry of the realm should permit the existence
of such horrid dwellings.</p>

<p>“I think,” continues my informant, “that the
majority of these poor wretches are without even
the idea of respectability or ‘home comforts,’&mdash;many
of them must be ranked among the worst
of our population. Some, who could live elsewhere,
prefer these wretched abodes, because
they answer various evil purposes. With beggars,
patterers, hawkers, tramps, and vendors
of their own manufacture, are mingled thieves,
women of easy virtue, and men of no virtue at
all; a few, and by far the smallest portion, are
persons who once filled posts of credit and
affluence, but whom bankruptcy, want of employment,
or sickness has driven to these dismal
retreats. The vast majority of London vagrants
take their summer vacation in the country, and
the ‘dodges’ of both are interchanged, and every
new ‘move’ circulates in almost no time.</p>

<p>“I will endeavour to sketch a few of the most
renowned ‘performers’ on this theatre of action.
By far the most illustrious is ‘Nicholas A&mdash;&mdash;,’
an ame known to the whole cadging fraternity
as a <i>real</i> descendant from Bamfylde Moore
Carew, and the ‘prince of lurkers’ and patterers
for thirty years past. This man owes
much of his success to his confessedly imposing
appearance, and many of his escapes to the known
respectability of his connections. His father&mdash;yet
alive&mdash;is a retired captain in the Royal
Navy, a gentleman of good private property,
and one of her Majesty’s justices of peace for
the county of Devon&mdash;the southern extremity of
which was the birth-place of Nicholas. But
little is known of his early days. He went to
school at Tavistock, where he received a good
education, and began life by cheating his schoolfellows.</p>

<p>“The foolish fondness of an indulgent mother,
and some want of firmness in paternal discipline,
accelerated the growth of every weed of
infamy in Nicholas, and baffled every experiment,
by sea and land, to ‘set’ him up in life.</p>

<p>“Scarcely was he out of his teens, when he
honoured the sister country with his visits and
his depredations. About the centre of Sackville-street,
Dublin, there lived a wealthy silversmith
of the name of Wise. Into his shop (accompanied
by one of his <i>pals</i> in livery) went Nicholas,
whose gentlemanly exterior, as I have already
hinted, would disarm suspicion in a stranger.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning sir, is your name Wise?&mdash;Yes,
sir.&mdash;Well, that is <i>my</i> name.&mdash;Indeed, of
the English family, I suppose?&mdash;Yes, sir, East
Kent.&mdash;Oh, indeed! related to the ladies of
Leeds Castle, I presume?&mdash;I have the honour
to be their brother.&mdash;James, is your name
James or John?&mdash;Neither, sir, it is Jacob.&mdash;Oh,
indeed! a very ancient name.&mdash;Well, I
have occasion to give a party at the Corn
Exchange Tavern, and I want a little plate on
hire, can you supply me?’&mdash;A very polite
affirmative settled this part of the business.
Plate to the amount of 150<i>l.</i> was selected and
arranged, when Nicholas discovered that his
pocket-book was at home (to complete the
deception, his right arm was in a sling). ‘Will
you, Mr. Wise (you see my infirmity), write me
a few lines?&mdash;With the greatest pleasure,’ was
the silversmith’s reply.&mdash;‘Well, let me see.
“<i>My dear, do not be surprised at this; I want
150l., or all the money you can send, per bearer;
I will explain at dinner-time.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">J. Wise.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>“‘Now, John, take this to your mistress, and
be quick.’ As John was not very hasty in his
return, Nicholas went to look for him, leaving
a strict injunction that the plate should be sent
to the Corn Exchange Tavern, as soon as the
deposit was received. This happened at eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in the forenoon&mdash;the clock struck five and no
return of either the master or the man.</p>

<p>“The jeweller left a message with his apprentice,
and went home to his dinner. He
was met at the door of his suburban villa by
his ‘better half,’ who wondered what made
him so late, and wished to know the nature of
the exigency which had caused him to send
home for so much money? The good man’s
perplexity was at an end when he saw his own
handwriting on the note; and every means within
the range of constabulary vigilance was taken
to capture the offender, but Nicholas and his
servant got clear off.</p>

<p>“This man’s ingenuity was then taxed as to
the next move, so he thought it expedient to <i>tax</i>
somebody else. He went with his ‘pal’ to a
miscellaneous repository, where they bought a
couple of old ledgers&mdash;useful only as waste
paper, a bag to hold money, two ink-bottles, &amp;c.
Thus equipped, they waited on the farmers of
the district, and exhibited a ‘fakement,’ setting
forth parliamentary authority for imposing a tax
upon the geese! They succeeded to admiration,
and weeks elapsed before the hoax was discovered.
The coolness of thus assuming legislatorial
functions, and being, at the same time,
the executive power, has rarely been equalled.</p>

<p>“There is an old proverb, that ‘It is an ill
wind that blows <i>nobody</i> good.’ The gallant ‘captain’
was domiciled at a lodging-house in Gainsborough,
Lincolnshire, where he found all the
lodgers complaining of the badness of the times&mdash;most
of them were makers of nets. He sallied
forth to all the general shops, and left his
(fictitious) ‘captain’ card at each, with an order
for an unusual number of nets. This ‘dodge’
gave a week’s work to at least twenty poor
people; but whether the shopkeepers were
‘caught in a net,’ or the articles were paid for
and removed by the ‘captain,’ or whether it
was a piece of pastime on his part, I did not
stay long enough to ascertain.</p>

<p>“Nicholas A&mdash;&mdash; is now in his sixty-second
year, a perfect hypochondriac. On his own authority&mdash;and
it is, no doubt, too true&mdash;he has
been ‘lurking’ on every conceivable system,
from forging a bill of exchange down to ‘<i>maundering
on the fly</i>,’ for the greater part of his
life; and, excepting the ‘hundred and thirteen
times’ he has been in provincial jails, society
has endured the scourge of his deceptions for
a quarter of a century at least. He now lives
with a young prostitute in Portsmouth, and contributes
to her wretched earnings an allowance
of 5<i>s.</i> a week, paid to him by the attorney of a
distant and disgusted relative.”</p>

<p>The writer of this account was himself two
whole years on the “monkry,” before he saw a
lodging-house for tramps; and the first he <i>ever</i>
saw was one well-known to every patterer in
Christendom, and whose fame he says is “gone
out into all lands,” for its wayfaring inmates
are very proud of its popularity.</p>

<p>“It may be as well,” writes the informant
in question, “before submitting the following
account, to state that there are other, and more
elaborate marks&mdash;the hieroglyphics of tramping&mdash;than
those already given. I will accordingly
explain them.</p>

<p>“Two hawkers (pals) go together, but separate
when they enter a village, one taking each side
of the road, and selling different things; and, so
as to inform each other as to the character of the
people at whose houses they call, they chalk
certain marks on their door-posts:</p>

<p>“<img src="images/0501a.png" class="inline" alt="arch and dash" /> means ‘Go on. <i>I</i> have called here; don’t
<i>you</i> call&mdash;it’s no go.’</p>

<p>“<img src="images/0501b.png" class="inline" alt="arch and plus sign" /> means ‘Stop&mdash;you may call here; they
want’ (for instance) ‘what <i>you</i> sell, though not
what <i>I</i> sell;’ or else, ‘They had no change when
I was there, but may have it now;’ or, ‘If they
don’t buy, at least they’ll treat you civilly.’</p>

<p>“<img src="images/0501c.png" class="inline" alt="backward C and dash" /> on a corner-house, or a sign-post, means,
‘I went this way;’ or ‘Go on in this direction.’</p>

<p>“<img src="images/0501d.png" class="inline" alt="backward C and plus" /> on a corner-house, or sign-post, means
‘Stop&mdash;don’t go any further in this direction.’</p>

<p>“<img src="images/0501e.png" class="inline" alt="circle with dot" /> as before explained, means ‘danger.’</p>

<p>“Like many other young men, I had lived
above my income, and, too proud to crave
parental forgiveness, had thrown off the bonds
of authority for a life of adventure. I was now
homeless upon the world. With a body capable
of either exertion or fatigue, and a heart not
easily terrified by danger, I endured rather than
enjoyed my itinerant position. I sold small
articles of Tunbridge ware, perfumery, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and by ‘munging’ (begging) over them&mdash;sometimes
in Latin&mdash;got a better living than I expected,
or probably deserved. I was always of
temperate and rather abstemious habits, but
ignorant of the haunts of other wanderers,
(whom I saw in dozens every day upon every
road, and every conceivable pursuit) I took
up my nightly quarters at a sort of third-rate
public-houses, and supposed that my contemporaries
did the same. How long my ignorance
might have continued (if left to myself)
I can hardly determine; an adventure at a
road-side inn, however, removed the veil from
my eyes, and I became gradually and speedily
‘awake’ to ‘every move on the board.’ It was a
lovely evening in July, the air was serene and
the scenery romantic; my own feelings were in
unison with both, and enhanced perhaps by the
fact that I had beguiled the last two miles of
my deliberate walk with a page out of my pocket-companion,
‘Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful.’
I was now smoking my pipe and quaffing
a pint of <i>real</i> ‘Yorkshire stingo’ in the ‘keeping
room’ (a term which combines parlour and
kitchen in one word) of a <i>real</i> ‘Yorkshire village,’
Dranfield, near Sheffield. A young person
of the other sex was my only and accidental
companion; she had been driven into the house
by the over-officiousness of a vigilant village
constable, who finding that she sold lace without
a license, and&mdash;infinitely worse&mdash;refused to
listen to his advances, had warned her to ‘make
herself scarce’ at her ‘earliest possible convenience.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Having elicited what I did for a living, she
popped the startling question to me, ‘Where do
you “hang out” in Sheffield?’ I told her that
I had never been in Sheffield, and did not
‘hang out’ my little wares, but used my persuasive
art to induce the purchase of them.
The lady said, ‘Well, you are “green.” I mean,
where do you <i>dos</i>?’ This was no better, it
seemed something like Greek,&mdash;‘<i>delta, omicron,
sigma</i>,’ (I retain the “patterer’s” own words to
show the education of the class)&mdash;but the etymology
was no relief to the perplexity. ‘Where
do you mean to sleep?’ she inquired. I referred
to my usual practice of adjourning to an
humble public-house. My companion at once
threw off all manner of disguise, and said,
‘Well, sir, you are a young man that I have
taken a liking to, and if you think you should
like my company, I will take you to a lodging
where there is plenty of travellers, and you will
see “all sorts of life.”’ I liked the girl’s company,
and our mutual acquiescence made us
companions on the road. We had not got far
before we met the aforesaid constable in company
with an unmistakeable member of the
Rural Police. They made some inquiries of
me, which I thought exceeded their commission.
I replied to them with a mutilated Ode of
Horace, when they both determined that I was
a Frenchman, and allowed us to ‘go on our
way rejoicing.’</p>

<p>“The smoky, though well-built, town of Sheffield
was now near at hand. The daylight was
past, and the ‘shades of the evening were
stretching out;’ we were therefore enabled to
journey through the thoroughfares without impertinent
remarks, or perhaps any observation,
except from a toothless old woman, of John
Wesley’s school, who was ‘sorry to see two such
nice young people going about the country,’ and
wondered if we ‘ever thought of eternity!’</p>

<p>“After a somewhat tedious ramble, we arrived
at Water-lane;&mdash;at the ‘Bug-trap,’ which from
time immemorial has been the name of the
most renowned lodging-house in that or perhaps
any locality. Water-lane is a dark narrow
street, crowded with human beings of the most
degraded sort&mdash;the chosen atmosphere of cholera,
and the stronghold of theft and prostitution.
In less than half an hour, my fair companion
and myself were sipping our tea, and eating
Yorkshire cake in this same lodging-house.</p>

<p>“‘God bless every happy couple!’ was echoed
from a rude stentorian voice, while a still ruder
hand bumped down upon our tea-table a red
earthen dish of no small dimensions, into which
was poured, from the mouth of a capacious bag,
fragments of fish, flesh, and fowl, viands and
vegetables of every sort, intermingled with bits
of cheese and dollops of Yorkshire pudding.
The man to whom this heterogeneous mass belonged,
appeared anything but satisfied with his
lot. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I don’t know what this
’ere monkry <i>will</i> come to, after a bit. Three bob
and a tanner, and that there dish o’ scran’
(enough to feed two families for a fortnight) ‘is
all I got this blessed day since seven o’clock in
the morning, and now it’s nine at night.’ I
ventured to say something, but a remark, too
base for repetition, ‘put the stunners on me,’
and I held my peace.</p>

<p>“I was here surprised, on conversing with my
young female companion, to find that she went
to church, said her prayers night and morning,
and knew many of the collects, some of which
she repeated, besides a pleasing variety of Dr.
Watts’s hymns. At the death of her mother,
her father had given up housekeeping; and,
being too fond of a wandering life, had led his
only child into habits like his own.</p>

<p>“As the night advanced, the party at the
‘Bug-trap’ more than doubled. High-flyers,
shallow-coves, turnpike-sailors, and swells out
of luck, made up an assembly of fourscore
human beings, more than half of whom were
doomed to sleep on a ‘make-shift’&mdash;in other
words, on a platform, raised just ten inches
above the floor of the garret, which it nearly
equalled in dimensions. Here were to be huddled
together, with very little covering, old men
and women, young men and children, with no
regard to age, sex, or propensities.</p>

<p>“The ‘mot’ of the ‘ken’ (nickname for
‘matron of the <i>establishment</i>’) had discovered
that I was a ‘more bettermost’ sort of person,
and hinted that, if I would ‘come down’ with
twopence more (threepence was the regular
nightly charge), I, ‘and the young gal as I was
with,’ might have a little ‘crib’ to ourselves in
a little room, along with another woman wot was
married and had a ‘kid,’ and whose husband
had got a month for ‘griddling in the main
drag’ (singing in the high street), and being
‘cheekish’ (saucy) to the beadle.</p>

<p>“Next morning I bade adieu to the ‘Bug-trap,’
and I hope for ever.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same informant further stated that he
was some time upon “tramp” before he even
knew of the existence of a common lodging-house:
“After I had ‘matriculated’ at Sheffield,”
he says, “I continued some time going to
public-houses to sleep, until my apparel having
got shabby and my acquintance with misfortune
more general, I submitted to be the associate
of persons whom I never spoke to out of
doors, and whose even slight acquaintance I
have long renounced. My first introduction to
a London paddin’ ken was in Whitechapel, the
place was then called Cat and Wheel-alley
(now Commercial-street). On the spot where
St. Jude’s church now stands was a double
lodging-house, kept by a man named Shirley&mdash;one
side of it was for single men and women,
the other married couples; as these ‘couples’
made frequent exchanges, it is scarcely probable
that Mr. Shirley ever ‘asked to see their
marriage lines.’ These changes were, indeed,
as common as they were disgusting. I knew
two brothers (Birmingham nailers) who each
brought a young woman out of service from the
country. After a while each became dissatisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with his partner. The mistress of the house (an
old procuress from Portsmouth) proposed that
they should change their wives. They did so,
to the amusement of nine other couples sleeping
on the same floor, and some of whom followed
the example, and more than once during the
night.</p>

<p>“When Cat and Wheel-alley was pulled
down, the crew removed to George-yard; the
proprietor died, and his wife sold the concern to
a wooden-legged Welshman named Hughes
(commonly called ‘Taff’). I was there some
time. ‘Taff’ was a notorious receiver of stolen
goods. I knew two little boys, who brought
home six pairs of new Wellington boots, which
this miscreant bought at 1<i>s.</i> per pair; and, when
they had no luck, he would take the strap off his
wooden-leg, and beat them through the nakedness
of their rags. He boarded and lodged
about a dozen Chelsea and Greenwich pensioners.
These he used to follow and watch closely
till they got paid; then (after they had settled
with him) he would make them drunk, and rob
them of the few shillings they had left.</p>

<p>“One of these dens of infamy may be taken
as a specimen of the whole class. They have
generally a spacious, though often ill-ventilated,
kitchen, the dirty dilapidated walls of which are
hung with prints, while a shelf or two are generally,
though barely, furnished with crockery
and kitchen utensils. In some places knives
and forks are not provided, unless a penny is
left with the ‘deputy,’ or manager, till they
are returned. A brush of any kind is a stranger,
and a looking-glass would be a miracle. The
average number of nightly lodgers is in winter
70, and in summer (when many visit the provinces)
from 40 to 45. The general charge is,
if two sleep together, 3<i>d.</i> per night, or 4<i>d.</i> for a
single bed. In either case, it is by no means
unusual to find 18 or 20 in one small room, the
heat and horrid smell from which are insufferable;
and, where there are young children, the
staircases are the lodgment of every kind of filth
and abomination. In some houses there are
rooms for families, where, on a rickety machine,
which they dignify by the name of a bedstead,
may be found the man, his wife, and a son or
daughter, perhaps 18 years of age; while the
younger children, aged from 7 to 14, sleep on
the floor. If they have linen, they take it off to
escape vermin, and rise naked, one by one, or
sometimes brother and sister together. This is
no ideal picture; the subject is too capable of
being authenticated to need that meaningless or
dishonest assistance called ‘allowable exaggeration.’
The amiable and deservedly popular
minister of a district church, built among lodging-houses,
has stated that he has found 29
human beings in one apartment; and that
having with difficulty knelt down between two
beds to pray with a dying woman, his legs became
so jammed that he could hardly get up
again.</p>

<p>“Out of some fourscore such habitations,”
continues my informant, “I have only found
<i>two</i> which had any sort of garden; and, I am
happy to add, that in neither of these two was
there a single case of cholera. In the others,
however, the pestilence raged with terrible
fury.</p>

<p>“Of all the houses of this sort, the best I
know is the one (previously referred to) in Orchard-street,
Westminister, and another in Seven
Dials, kept by a Mr. Mann (formerly a wealthy
butcher). Cleanliness is inscribed on every wall
of the house; utensils of every kind are in
abundance, with a plentiful supply of water and
gas. The beds do not exceed five in a room,
and they are changed every week. There is not
one disorderly lodger; and although the master
has sustained heavy losses, ill health, and much
domestic affliction, himself and his house may
be regarded as patterns of what is wanted for
the London poor.</p>

<p>“As there is a sad similarity between these
abodes, so there is a sort of <i>caste</i> belonging in
general to the inmates. Of them it may be averred
that whatever their pursuits, they are more or less
alike in their views of men and manners. They
hate the aristocracy. Whenever there is a
rumour or an announcement of an addition to
the Royal Family, and the news reaches the
padding-ken, the kitchen, for half-an-hour, becomes
the scene of uproar&mdash;‘another expense
coming on the b&mdash;y country!’ The ‘patterers’
are very fond of the Earl of Carlisle, whom, in
their attachment, they still call Lord Morpeth;
they have read many of his lordship’s speeches
at <i>soirées</i>, &amp;c., and they think he wishes well to
a poor man. Sir James Graham had better not
show face among them; they have an idea
(whence derived we know not) that this nobleman
invented fourpenny-pieces, and now, they
say, the swells give a ‘joey’ where they used to
give a ‘tanner.’ The hero of Waterloo is not
much amiss ‘if he lets politics alone.’ The
name of a bishop is but another name for a
Beelzebub; but they are very fond of the inferior
clergy. Lay-agents and tract-distributors
they cannot bear; they think they are spies
come to see how much ‘scran’ (food) they have
got, and then go and ‘pyson’ the minds of the
public against poor people.</p>

<p>“I was once (says our informant) in a house
of this kind, in George-street, St. Giles’s,&mdash;the
missionary who visited them on that occasion
(Sunday afternoon) had the misfortune to be
suspected as the author of some recent exposure
in the newspapers.&mdash;They accused him,
and he rebutted the accusation; they replied,
and he rejoined; at last one of the men said,
‘What do you want poking your nose in here
for?’ ‘The City Mission,’ was the answer,
‘had authorised &mdash;&mdash;.’ ‘Authorised be d&mdash;d!
are you ordained?’ ‘No, not yet, friend.’ The
women then tore the poor gentleman’s nether
garments in a way I must not describe. The
men carried him into the yard, filled his mouth
with flour of mustard and then put him in a
water-butt.</p>

<p>“It is, I am satisfied, quite a mistake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
suppose that there is much real infidelity
among these outcast beings. They almost all
believe in a hereafter; most of them think that
the wicked will be punished for a few years, and
then the whole universe of people be embraced
in the arms of one Great Forgiving Father.
Some of them think that the wicked will not
rise at <i>all</i>; the punishment of ‘losing Heaven’
being as they say ‘Hell enough for anybody.’
Points of doctrine they seldom meddle with.</p>

<p>“There are comparatively few Dissenters to
be found in padding-kens, though many whose
parents were Dissenters. My own opinion
(writes my informant) is, that dissent seldom
lasts long in one family. In eight years’ experience
I have found two hundred apparently
pious men and women, and at least two thousand
who call themselves Protestants, but never
go to any church or chapel.</p>

<p>“The politics of these classes are, perhaps,
for the most part, ‘liberal Tory.’ In most
lodging-houses they take one or two papers: the
<i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, and <i>Bell’s Weekly Messenger</i>,
are the two usually taken. I know of no
exception to this rule. The beggars hate a
Whig Ministry, and I know that many a tear
was shed in the hovels and cellars of London
when Sir Robert Peel died. I know a publican,
in Westminster, whose daily receipts are
enormous, and whose only customers are soldiers,
thieves, and prostitutes, who closed his
house the day of the funeral, and put himself,
his family, and even his beer-machines and
gas-pipes, into mourning for the departed
statesman.</p>

<p>“The pattering fraternity, that I write of, are
generally much given to intemperance. Their
amusements are the theatre, the free-and-easy,
the skittle-ground, and sometimes cards and
dominoes. They read some light works, and
some of them subscribe to libraries, and a few,
very few, attend lectures. Eliza Cook is a
favourite writer with them, and Capt. Marryatt,
the ‘top-sawyer,’ as a novelist. Ainsworth is the
idol of another class, when they can read. Mr.
Dickens <i>was</i> a favourite, but he has gone down
sadly in the scale since his <i>Household Words</i>
‘came it so strong’ against the begging letter
department. These poor creatures seldom rise
in society. They make no effort to extricate
themselves, while by others they are unpitied
because unknown. To this rule, however, there
are some happy and honourable exceptions.</p>

<p>“Taken as a body, patterers, lurkers, &amp;c.
are by no means quick-sighted as to the sanctions
of moral obligation. They would join the
hue and cry against the persecutors of Jane
Wilbred, but a promiscuous robbery, even
accompanied by murder&mdash;if it was ‘got up
clever’ and ‘done clean,’ so long as the parties
escaped detection&mdash;might call forth a remark
that ‘there was no great harm done,’ and perhaps
some would applaud the perpetrators.”</p>

<p>Before quitting this part of my subject (viz.
the character, habits, and opinions of <i>all</i> classes
of patterers), I will give an account of the pretended
missionary proceedings of a man, well-known
to the vagrant fraternity as “Chelsea
George.” I received the following narrative
from the gentleman whose statements I have
given previously. The scheme was concocted in
a low lodging-house:</p>

<p>“After a career of incessant ‘lurking’ and
deceit, Chelsea George left England, and remained
abroad,” writes my informant, “four or
five years. Exposure to the sun, and allowing
his beard to grow a prodigious length, gave him
the appearance of a foreigner. He had picked
up enough French and Italian, with a little
Dutch and German, and a smattering of Spanish,
to enable him to ‘hail for any part of the
globe,’ and from the designed inarticulateness
with which he spoke (sometimes four languages
in one sentence) added to his sun-burnt and
grotesque appearance, it was difficult to <i>pall</i>
him upon any <i>racket</i> (detect him in any pretence),
so that the most incredulous,&mdash;though
often previously imposed upon&mdash;gave credence
to his story, relief to his supposed necessities,
and sometimes letters of introduction to their
friends and neighbours.</p>

<p>“Some time after his return to England, and
while pursuing the course of a ‘high-flyer’
(genteel beggar), he met with an interruption to
his pursuits which induced him to alter his
plan without altering his behaviour. The newspapers
of the district, where he was then located,
had raised before the eye and mind of the
public, what the ‘patterers’ of his class proverbially
call a ‘stink,’&mdash;that is, had opened the
eyes of the unwary to the movements of ‘Chelsea
George;’ and although he ceased to renew
his appeals from the moment he heard of the
notice of him, his appearance was so accurately
described that he was captured and committed
to Winchester jail as a rogue and vagabond.
The term of his imprisonment has escaped my
recollection. As there was no definite charge
against him, probably he was treated as an
ordinary vagrant and suffered a calendar month
in durance. The silent system was not then in
vogue, consequently there existed no barrier to
mutual intercourse between prisoners, with all
its train of conscience-hardening tendencies. I
do not say this to intimate unqualified approval
of the solitary system, I merely state a fact
which has an influence on my subject.</p>

<p>“George had by this time scraped acquaintance
with two fellow-prisoners&mdash;Jew Jem and
Russia Bob. The former in ‘quod’ for ‘pattering’
as a ‘converted Jew,’ the latter for
obtaining money under equally false, though
less theological, pretences.</p>

</div>

<p>“Liberated about one time, this trio laid
their heads together,&mdash;and the result was a plan
to evangelize, or rather victimize, the inhabitants
of the collier villages in Staffordshire and
the adjoining counties. To accomplish this purpose,
some novel and imposing representation
must be made, both to lull suspicion and give
the air of piety to the plan, and disinterestedness
to the agents by whom it was carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“George and his two fellow-labourers were
‘square-rigged’&mdash;that is, well dressed. Something,
however, must be done to colour up the
scene, and make the appeal for money touching,
unsuspected, and successful. Just before the
time to which I allude, a missionary from Sierra
Leone had visited the larger towns of the district
in question, while the inhabitants of the
surrounding hamlets had been left in ignorance
of the ‘progress of missions in Africa and the
East.’ George and his comrades thought it
would be no great harm at once to enlighten and
fleece this scattered and anxious population.
The plan was laid in a town of some size and
facility. They ‘raised the wind’ to an extent
adequate to some alteration of their appearances,
and got bills printed to set forth the merits of
the cause. The principal actor was Jew Jim, a
converted Israelite, with ‘reverend’ before his
name, and half the letters of the alphabet behind
it. He had been in all the islands of the South
Sea, on the coast of Africa, all over Hindostan,
and half over the universe; and after assuring
the villagers of Torryburn that he had carried
the Gospel to various dark and <i>uninhabited</i> parts
of the earth, he introduced Russia Bob (an
Irishman who had, however, been in Russia) as
his worthy and self-denying colleague, and Chelsea
George as the first-fruits of their ministry&mdash;as
one who had left houses and land, wife and
children, and taken a long and hazardous voyage
to show Christians in England that their sable
brethren, children of one common Parent, were
beginning to cast their idols to the moles and
to the bats. Earnest was the gaze and breathless
the expectation with which the poor deluded
colliers of Torry-burn listened to this harangue;
and as argument always gains by illustration,
the orator pulled out a tremendous black doll,
bought for a ‘flag’ (fourpence) of a retired rag-merchant,
and dressed up in Oriental style.
This, Jew Jim assured the audience, was an idol
brought from Murat in Hindostan. He presented
it to Chelsea George for his worship and
embraces. The convert indignantly repelled
the insinuation, pushed the idol from him, spat
in its face, and cut as many capers as a dancing-bear.
The trio at this stage of the performances
began ‘puckering’ (talking privately) to each
other in murdered French, dashed with a little
Irish; after which, the missionaries said that
their convert (who had only a few words of
English) would now profess his faith. All was
attention as Chelsea George came forward. He
stroked his beard, put his hand in his breast to
keep down his dickey, and turning his eyes
upwards, said: ‘I believe in Desus Tist&mdash;dlory
to ’is ’oly Name!’</p>

<p>“This elicited some loud ‘amens’ from an
assemblage of nearly 1,000 persons, and catching
the favourable opportunity, a ‘school of
pals,’ appointed for the purpose, went round
and made the collection. Out of the abundance
of their credulity and piety the populace contributed
sixteen pounds! The whole scene
was enacted out of doors, and presented to a
stranger very pleasing impressions. I was present
on the occasion, but was not then aware
of the dodge. One verse of a hymn, and the
blessing pronounced, was the signal for separation.
A little shaking of hands concluded the
exhibition, and ‘every man went into his own
house.’</p>

<p>“The missionary party and their ‘pals’ took
the train to Manchester, and as none of them
were teetotallers, the proceeds of their imposition
did not last long. They were just putting
on their considering caps, for the contrivance of
another dodge, when a gentleman in blue clothes
came into the tap-room, and informed Jew Jem
that he was ‘wanted.’ It appears that ‘Jem’
had come out of prison a day or two before his
comrades, and being ‘hard up,’ had ill-used a
lady, taken her purse, and appropriated its
contents. Inquiries, at first useless, had now
proved successful&mdash;the ‘missionary’ stood his
trial, and got an ‘appointment’ on Norfolk
Island. Russia Bob took the cholera and died,
and ‘George the convert’ was once more left
alone to try his hand at something else.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Low Lodging-houses of London.</span></h3>

<p>The patterers, as a class, usually frequent the
low lodging-houses. I shall therefore now proceed
to give some further information touching
the abodes of these people&mdash;reminding the reader
that I am treating of patterers in general, and
not of any particular order, as the “paper
workers.”</p>

<p>In applying the epithet “low” to these places,
I do but adopt the word commonly applied,
either in consequence of the small charge for
lodging, or from the character of their frequenters.
To some of these domiciles, however,
as will be shown, the epithet, in an opprobrious
sense, is unsuited.</p>

<p>An intelligent man, familiar for some years
with some low lodging-house life, specified the
quarters where those abodes are to be found,
and divided them into the following districts, the
correctness of which I caused to be ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Drury-lane District.</i> Here the low lodging-houses
are to be found principally in the Coal-yard,
Charles-street, King-street, Parker-street,
Short’s-gardens, Great and Little Wyld-streets,
Wyld-court, Lincoln-court, Newton-street, Star-court.</p>

<p><i>Gray’s-inn Lane.</i> Fox-court, Charlotte-buildings,
Spread Eagle-court, Portpool-lane,
Bell-court, Baldwin’s-gardens, Pheasant-court,
Union-buildings, Laystall-street, Cromer-street,
Fulwood’s-rents (High Holborn).</p>

<p><i>Chancery-lane.</i> Church-passage, and the
Liberty of the Rolls.</p>

<p><i>Bloomsbury.</i> George-street, Church-lane,
Queen-street, Seven-dials, Puckeridge-street
(commonly called the Holy Land).</p>

<p><i>Saffron-hill and Clerkenwell.</i> Peter-street, Cow-cross,
Turnmill-street, Upper and Lower White-cross-street,
St. Helen’s-place, Playhouse-yard,
Chequer-alley, Field-lane, Great Saffron-hill.</p>

<p><i>Westminster.</i> Old and New Pye-streets, Ann-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>street,
Orchard-street, Perkins’s-rents, Rochester-row.</p>

<p><i>Lambeth.</i> Lambeth-walk, New-cut.</p>

<p><i>Marylebone.</i> York-court, East-street.</p>

<p><i>St. Pancras.</i> Brooke-street.</p>

<p><i>Paddington.</i> Chapel-street, Union-court.</p>

<p><i>Shoreditch.</i> Baker’s-rents, Cooper’s-gardens.</p>

<p><i>Islington.</i> Angel-yard.</p>

<p><i>Whitechapel, Spitalfields, &amp;c.</i> George-yard,
Thrawl-street, Flower and Dean-street, Wentworth-street,
Keate-street, Rosemary-lane,
Glasshouse-yard, St. George’s-street, Lambeth-street,
Whitechapel, High-street.</p>

<p><i>Borough.</i> Mint-street, Old Kent-street, Long-lane,
Bermondsey.</p>

<p><i>Stratford.</i> High-street.</p>

<p><i>Limehouse.</i> Hold (commonly called Hole).</p>

<p><i>Deptford.</i> Mill-lane, Church-street, Gifford-street.</p>

<p>There are other localities, (as in Mile-end,
Ratcliffe-highway, Shadwell, Wapping, and
Lisson-grove,) where low lodging-houses are to
be found; but the places I have specified may
be considered the <i>districts</i> of these hotels for
the poor. The worst places, both as regards
filth and immorality, are in St. Giles’s and
Wentworth-street, Whitechapel. The best are in
Orchard-street, Westminster (the thieves having
left it in consequence of the recent alterations
and gone to New Pye-street), and in the Mint,
Borough. In the last-mentioned district, indeed,
some of the proprietors of the lodging-houses
have provided considerable libraries for
the use of the inmates. In the White Horse,
Mint-street, for instance, there is a collection of
500 volumes, on all subjects, bought recently,
and having been the contents of a circulating
library, advertised for sale in the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>Of lodging-houses for “travellers” the
largest is known as the Farm House, in the
Mint: it stands away from any thoroughfare,
and lying low is not seen until the visitor stands
in the yard. Tradition rumour states that the
house was at one time Queen Anne’s, and was
previously Cardinal Wolsey’s. It was probably
some official residence. In this lodging-house
are forty rooms, 200 beds (single and
double), and accommodation for 200 persons.
It contains three kitchens,&mdash;of which the largest,
at once kitchen and sitting-room, holds 400
people, for whose uses in cooking there are two
large fire-places. The other two kitchens are
used only on Sundays; when one is a preaching-room,
in which missionaries from Surrey
Chapel (the Rev. James Sherman’s), or some
minister or gentleman of the neighbourhood,
officiates. The other is a reading-room, supplied
with a few newspapers and other periodicals;
and thus, I was told, the religious and
irreligious need not clash. For the supply of
these papers each person pays 1<i>d.</i> every Sunday
morning; and as the sum so collected is
more than is required for the expenses of the
reading-room, the surplus is devoted to the
help of the members in sickness, under the
management of the proprietor of the lodging-house,
who appears to possess the full confidence
of his inmates. The larger kitchen is
detached from the sleeping apartments, so that
the lodgers are not annoyed with the odour of
the cooking of fish and other food consumed by
the poor; for in lodging-houses every sojourner
is his own cook. The meal in most demand is
tea, usually with a herring, or a piece of bacon.</p>

<p>The yard attached to the Farm House, in
Mint-street, covers an acre and a half; in it
is a washing-house, built recently, the yard
itself being devoted to the drying of the clothes&mdash;washed
by the customers of the establishment.
At the entrance to this yard is a kind of porter’s
lodge, in which reside the porter and his wife
who act as the “deputies” of the lodging-house.
This place has been commended in
sanitary reports, for its cleanliness, good order,
and care for decency, and for a proper division
of the sexes. On Sundays there is no charge
for lodging to known customers; but this is a
general practice among the low lodging-houses
of London.</p>

<p>In contrast to this house I could cite many
instances, but I need do no more in this place
than refer to the statements, which I shall proceed
to give; some of these were collected in the course
of a former inquiry, and are here given because
the same state of things prevails now. I was
told by a trustworthy man that not long ago
he was compelled to sleep in one of the lowest
(as regards cheapness) of the lodging-houses.
All was dilapidation, filth, and noisomeness.
In the morning he drew, for purposes of ablution,
a basinfull of water from a pailfull kept
in the room. In the water were floating
alive, or apparently alive, bugs and lice,
which my informant was convinced had fallen
from the ceiling, shaken off by the tread
of some one walking in the rickety apartments
above!</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said another man with whom I
conversed on the subject, “if you had lived in
the lodging-houses, you would say what a vast
difference a penny made,&mdash;it’s often all in all.
It’s 4<i>d.</i> in the Mint House you’ve been asking
me about; you’ve sleep and comfort there, and
I’ve seen people kneel down and say their
prayers afore they went to bed. Not so many,
though. Two or three in a week at nights,
perhaps. And it’s wholesome and sweet enough
there, and large separate beds; but in other
places there’s nothing to smell or feel but bugs.
When daylight comes in the summer&mdash;and it’s
often either as hot as hell or as cold as icicles
in those places; but in summer, as soon as its
light, if you turn down the coverlet, you’ll
see them a-going it like Cheapside when it’s
throngest.” The poor man seemed to shudder
at the recollection.</p>

<p>One informant counted for me 180 of these
low lodging-houses; and it is reasonable to say
that there are, in London, at least 200 of them.
The average number of beds in each was computed
for me, by persons cognizant of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
matters, from long and often woful experience,
at 52 single or 24 double beds, where the
house might be confined to single men or
single women lodgers, or to married or pretendedly
married couples, or to both classes.
In either case, we may calculate the number
that can be, and generally are, accommodated at
50 per house; for children usually sleep with
their parents, and 50 may be the lowest computation.
We have thus no fewer than 10,000
persons domiciled, more or less permanently,
in the low lodging-houses of London&mdash;a number
more than doubling the population of many a
parliamentary borough.</p>

<p>The proprietors of these lodging-houses mostly
have been, I am assured, vagrants, or, to use the
civiller and commoner word, “travellers” themselves,
and therefore sojourners, on all necessary
occasions, in such places. In four cases out of
five I believe this to be the case. The proprietors
have raised capital sufficient to start with,
sometimes by gambling at races, sometimes by
what I have often, and very vaguely, heard
described as a “run of luck;” and sometimes,
I am assured, by the proceeds of direct robbery.
A few of the proprietors may be classed as
capitalists. One of them, who has a country
house in Hampstead, has six lodging-houses in
or about Thrawl-street, Whitechapel. He looks
in at each house every Saturday, and calls his
deputies&mdash;for he has a deputy in each house&mdash;to
account; he often institutes a stringent
check. He gives a poor fellow money to go
and lodge in one of his houses, and report the
number present. Sometimes the person so sent
meets with the laconic repulse&mdash;“Full;” and
woe to the deputy if his return do not evince
this fulness. Perhaps one in every fifteen of the
low lodging-houses in town is also a beer-shop.
Very commonly so in the country.</p>

<p>To “start” a low lodging-house is not a very
costly matter. Furniture which will not be
saleable in the ordinary course of auction, or
of any traffic, is bought by a lodging-house
“starter.” A man possessed of some money,
who took an interest in a bricklayer, purchased
for 20<i>l.</i>, when the Small Pox Hospital, by
King’s-cross, was pulled down, a sufficiency of
furniture for <i>four</i> lodging-houses, in which he
“started” the man in question. None others
would buy this furniture, from a dread of infection.</p>

<p>It was the same at Marlborough-house, Peckham,
after the cholera had broken out there.
The furniture was sold to a lodging-house
keeper, at 9<i>d.</i> each article. “Big and little,
sir,” I was told; “a penny pot and a bedstead&mdash;all
the same; each 9<i>d.</i> Nobody else would
buy.”</p>

<p>To about three-fourths of the low lodging-houses
of London, are “deputies.” These are
the conductors or managers of the establishment,
and are men or women (and not unfrequently
a married, or proclaimed a married
couple), and about in equal proportion. These
deputies are paid from 7<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a week each,
according to the extent of their supervision; their
lodging always, and sometimes their board,
being at the cost of “the master.” According
to the character of the lodging-house, the deputies
are civil and decent, or roguish and insolent.
Their duty is not only that of general superintendence,
but in some of the houses of a nocturnal
inspection of the sleeping-rooms; the
deputy’s business generally keeping him up all
night. At the better-conducted houses strangers
are not admitted after twelve at night; in others,
there is no limitation as to hours.</p>

<p>The rent of the low lodging-houses varies, I am
informed, from 8<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> a week, the payment
being for the most part weekly; the taxes and
rates being of course additional. It is rarely
that the landlord, or his agent, can be induced
to expend any money in repairs,&mdash;the wear and
tear of the floors, &amp;c., from the congregating
together of so many human beings being excessive:
this expenditure in consequence falls upon
the tenant.</p>

<p>Some of the lodging-houses present no appearance
differing from that of ordinary houses;
except, perhaps, that their exterior is dirtier.
Some of the older houses have long flat windows
on the ground-floor, in which there is rather
more paper, or other substitutes, than glass.
“The windows there, sir,” remarked one man,
“are not to let the light in, but to keep the
cold out.”</p>

<p>In the abodes in question there seems to have
become tacitly established an arrangement as to
what character of lodgers shall resort thither;
the thieves, the prostitutes, and the better class
of street-sellers or traders, usually resorting to
the houses where they will meet the same class
of persons. The patterers reside chiefly in Westminster
and Whitechapel.</p>

<p>Some of the lodging-houses are of the worst
class of low brothels, and some may even be
described as brothels for children.</p>

<p>On many of the houses is a rude sign,
“Lodgings for Travellers, 3<i>d.</i> a night. Boiling
water always ready,” or the same intimation
may be painted on a window-shutter, where a
shutter is in existence. A few of the better
order of these housekeepers post up small bills,
inviting the attention of “travellers,” by laudations
of the cleanliness, good beds, abundant
water, and “gas all night,” to be met with.
The same parties also give address-cards to
travellers, who can recommend one another.</p>

<p>The beds are of flock, and as regards the mere
washing of the rug, sheet, and blanket, which
constitute the bed-furniture, are in better order
than they were a few years back; for the visitations
of the cholera alarmed even the reckless
class of vagrants, and those whose avocations
relate to vagrants. In perhaps a tenth of the
low lodging-houses of London, a family may
have a room to themselves, with the use of the
kitchen, at so much a week&mdash;generally 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for a couple without family, and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> where
there are children. To let out “beds” by the
night is however the general rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The illustration presented this week is of a
place in Fox-court, Gray’s-inn-lane, long notorious
as a “thieves’ house,” but now far less frequented.
On the visit, a few months back, of an
informant (who declined staying there), a number
of boys were lying on the floor gambling
with marbles and halfpennies, and indulging in
savage or unmeaning blasphemy. One of the
lads jumped up, and murmuring something that
it wouldn’t do to be idle any longer, induced a
woman to let him have a halfpenny for “a stall;”
that is, as a pretext with which to enter a shop
for the purpose of stealing, the display of the
coin forming an excuse for his entrance. On
the same occasion a man walked into “the
kitchen,” and coolly pulled from underneath
the back of his smock-frock a large flat piece
of bacon, for which he wanted a customer. It
would be sold at a fourth of its value.</p>

<p>I am assured that the average takings of lodging-house
keepers may be estimated at 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a night, not to say 20<i>s.</i>; but I adopt the lower
calculation. This gives a weekly payment by
the struggling poor, the knavish, and the outcast,
of 1,000 guineas weekly, or 52,000 guineas
in the year. Besides the rent and taxes, the
principal expenditure of the lodging-house proprietors
is for coals and gas. In some of the
better houses, blacking, brushes, and razors are
supplied, without charge, to the lodgers: also
pen and ink, soap, and, almost always, a newspaper.
For the meals of the frequenters salt is
supplied gratuitously, and sometimes, but far
less frequently, pepper also; never vinegar or
mustard. Sometimes a halfpenny is charged
for the use of a razor and the necessary shaving
apparatus. In one house in Kent-street, the
following distich adorns the mantel-piece:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“To save a journey up the town,</div>
       <div class="verse">A razor lent here for a <i>brown</i>:</div>
       <div class="verse">But if you think the price too high,</div>
       <div class="verse">I beg you won’t the razor try.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In some places a charge of a halfpenny is made
for hot water, but that is very rarely the case.
Strong drink is admitted at almost any hour in
the majority of the houses, and the deputy is
generally ready to bring it; but little is consumed
in the houses, those addicted to the use or abuse
of intoxicating liquors preferring the tap-room
or the beer-shop.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Filth, Dishonesty, and Immorality
of Low Lodging-houses.</span></h3>

<p>In my former and my present inquiries, I received
many statements on this subject. Some details,
given by coarse men and boys in the grossest
language, are too gross to be more than alluded
to, but the full truth must be manifested, if not
detailed. It was remarked when my prior account
appeared, that the records of gross profligacy
on the part of some of the most licentious
of the rich (such as the late Marquis of Hertford
and other worthies of the same depraved
habits) were equalled, or nearly equalled, by
the account of the orgies of the lowest lodging-houses.
Sin, in any rank of life, shows the same
features.</p>

<p>And first, as to the want of cleanliness, comfort,
and decency: “Why, sir,” said one man,
who had filled a commercial situation of no
little importance, but had, through intemperance,
been reduced to utter want, “I myself have
slept in the top room of a house not far from
Drury-lane, and you could study the stars, if
you were so minded, through the holes left by
the slates having been blown off the roof. It
was a fine summer’s night, and the openings in
the roof were then rather an advantage, for they
admitted air, and the room wasn’t so foul as it
might have been without them. I never went
there again, but you may judge what thoughts
went through a man’s mind&mdash;a man who had
seen prosperous days&mdash;as he lay in a place like
that, without being able to sleep, watching the
sky.”</p>

<p>The same man told me (and I received abundant
corroboration of his statement, besides that
incidental mention of the subject occurs elsewhere),
that he had scraped together a handful
of bugs from the bed-clothes, and crushed them
under a candlestick, and had done that many a
time, when he could only resort to the lowest
places. He had slept in rooms so crammed
with sleepers&mdash;he believed there were 30 where
12 would have been a proper number&mdash;that
their breaths in the dead of night and in the
unventilated chamber, rose (I use his own
words) “in one foul, choking steam of stench.”
This was the case most frequently a day or
two prior to Greenwich Fair or Epsom Races,
when the congregation of the wandering classes,
who are the supporters of the low lodging-houses,
was the thickest. It was not only that
two or even three persons jammed themselves
into a bed not too large for one full-sized
man; but between the beds&mdash;and their partition
one from another admitted little more
than the passage of a lodger&mdash;were placed
shakes-down, or temporary accommodation for
nightly slumber. In the better lodging-houses
the shake-downs are small palliasses or mattresses;
in the worst, they are bundles of rags
of any kind; but loose straw is used only in the
country for shake-downs. One informant saw
a traveller, who had arrived late, eye his shake-down
in one of the worst houses with anything
but a pleased expression of countenance; and
a surly deputy, observing this, told the customer
he had his choice, “which,” the deputy
added, “it’s not all men as has, or I shouldn’t
have been waiting here on you. But you has
your choice, I tell you;&mdash;sleep there on that
shake-down, or turn out and be d&mdash;&mdash;; that’s
fair.” At some of the busiest periods, numbers
sleep on the kitchen floor, all huddled together,
men and women (when indecencies are common
enough), and without bedding or anything but
their scanty clothes to soften the hardness of
the stone or brick floor. A penny is saved to
the lodger by this means. More than 200 have
been accommodated in this way in a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
house. The Irish, at harvest-time, very often
resort to this mode of passing the night.</p>

<p>I heard from several parties, of the surprise,
and even fear or horror, with which a decent
mechanic&mdash;more especially if he were accompanied
by his wife&mdash;regarded one of these foul
dens, when destitution had driven him there for
the first time in his life. Sometimes such a
man was seen to leave the place abruptly,
though perhaps he had pre-paid his last halfpenny
for the refreshment of a night’s repose.
Sometimes he was seized with sickness. I
heard also from some educated persons who
had “seen better days,” of the disgust with
themselves and with the world, which they felt
on first entering such places. “And I have
some reason to believe,” said one man, “that
a person, once well off, who has sunk into
the very depths of poverty, often makes his
first appearance in one of the worst of those
places. Perhaps it is because he keeps away
from them as long as he can, and then, in a sort
of desperation fit, goes into the cheapest he
meets with; or if he knows it’s a vile place, he
very likely says to himself&mdash;I did&mdash;‘I may as
well know the worst at once.’”</p>

<p>Another man who had moved in good society,
said, when asked about his resorting to a low
lodging-house: “When a man’s lost caste in
society, he may as well go the whole hog, bristles
and all, and a low lodging-house is the entire
pig.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding many abominations, I am
assured that the lodgers, in even the worst of
these habitations, for the most part sleep soundly.
But they have, in all probability, been out in
the open air the whole of the day, and all of
them may go to their couches, after having
walked, perhaps, many miles, exceedingly fatigued,
and some of them half-drunk. “Why,
in course, sir,” said a “traveller,” whom I spoke
to on this subject, “if you is in a country town
or village, where there’s only one lodging-house,
perhaps, and that a bad one&mdash;an old hand can
always suit his-self in London&mdash;you <i>must</i> get
half-drunk, or your money for your bed is
wasted. There’s so much rest owing to you,
after a hard day; and bugs and bad air’ll prevent
its being paid, if you don’t lay in some
stock of beer, or liquor of some sort, to sleep on.
It’s a duty you owes yourself; but, if you
haven’t the browns, why, then, in course, you
can’t pay it.” I have before remarked, and,
indeed, have given instances, of the odd and
sometimes original manner in which an intelligent
patterer, for example, will express himself.</p>

<p>The information I obtained in the course of
this inquiry into the condition of low lodging-houses,
afforded a most ample corroboration of
the truth of a remark I have more than once
found it necessary to make before&mdash;that persons
of the vagrant class will sacrifice almost anything
for warmth, not to say heat. Otherwise,
to sleep, or even sit, in some of the apartments
of these establishments would be intolerable.</p>

<p>From the frequent state of weariness to which
I have alluded, there is generally less conversation
among the frequenters of the low lodging-houses
than might be expected. Some are busy
cooking, some (in the better houses) are reading,
many are drowsy and nodding, and many are
smoking. In perhaps a dozen places of the
worst and filthiest class, indeed, smoking is permitted
even in the sleeping-rooms; but it is far
less common than it was even half-a-dozen years
back, and becomes still less common yearly.
Notwithstanding so dangerous a practice, fires
are and have been very unfrequent in these
places. There is always some one awake, which
is one reason. The lack of conversation, I ought
to add, and the weariness and drowsiness, are
less observable in the lodging-houses patronised
by thieves and women of abandoned character,
whose lives are comparatively idle, and whose
labour a mere nothing. In their houses, if the
conversation be at all general, it is often of the
most unclean character. At other times it is
carried on in groups, with abundance of whispers,
shrugs, and slang, by the members of the
respective schools of thieves or lurkers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now to speak of the habitual violation
of all the injunctions of law, of all the obligations
of morality, and of all the restraints of
decency, seen continually in the vilest of the
lodging-houses. I need but cite a few facts, for
to detail minutely might be to disgust. In some
of these lodging-houses, the proprietor&mdash;or, I
am told, it might be more correct to say, the
proprietress, as there are more women than
men engaged in the nefarious traffic carried on
in these houses&mdash;are “fences,” or receivers of
stolen goods in a small way. <i>Their</i> “fencing,”
unless as the very exception, does not extend to
any plate, or jewellery, or articles of value, but
is chiefly confined to provisions, and most of all
to those which are of ready sale to the lodgers.</p>

<p>Of very ready sale are “fish got from the
gate” (stolen from Billingsgate); “sawney”
(thieved bacon), and “flesh found in Leadenhall”
(butcher’s-meat stolen from that market).
I was told by one of the most respectable
tradesmen in Leadenhall-market, that it was
infested&mdash;but not now to so great an extent as
it was&mdash;with lads and young men, known there
as “finders.” They carry bags round their
necks, and pick up bones, or offal, or pieces of
string, or bits of papers, or “anything, sir,
please, that a poor lad, that has neither father
nor mother, and is werry hungry, can make a
ha’penny by to get him a bit of bread, please,
sir.” This is often but a cover for stealing
pieces of meat, and the finders, with their proximate
market for disposal of their meat in the
lowest lodging-houses in Whitechapel, go boldly
about their work, for the butchers, if the “finder”
be detected, “won’t,” I was told by a sharp
youth who then was at a low lodging-house in
Keate-street, “go bothering theirselves to a
beak, but gives you a scruff of the neck and a
kick and lets you go. But some of them kicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
werry hard.” The tone and manner of this boy&mdash;and
it is a common case enough with the
“prigs”&mdash;showed that he regarded hard kicking
merely as one of the inconveniences to
which his business-pursuits were unavoidably
subjected; just as a struggling housekeeper
might complain of the unwelcome calls of the
tax-gatherers. These depredations are more
frequent in Leadenhall-market than in any of
the others, on account of its vicinity to Whitechapel.
Even the Whitechapel meat-market is
less the scene of prey, for it is a series of shops,
while Leadenhall presents many stalls, and the
finders seem loath to enter shops without some
plausible pretext.</p>

<p>Groceries, tea especially, stolen from the
docks, warehouses, or shops, are things in excellent
demand among the customers of a
lodging-house fence. Tea, known or believed
to have been stolen “genuine” from any dock,
is bought and sold very readily; 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, however,
is a not unfrequent price for what is
known as 5<i>s.</i> tea. Sugar, spices, and other
descriptions of stolen grocery, are in much
smaller request.</p>

<p>Wearing-apparel is rarely bought by the
fences I am treating of; but the stealers of it
can and do offer their wares to the lodgers, who
will often, before buying, depreciate the garment,
and say “It’s never been nothing better
nor a Moses.”</p>

<p>“Hens and chickens” are a favourite theft,
and “go at once to the pot,” but in no culinary
sense. The hens and chickens of the roguish
low lodging-houses are the publicans’ pewter
measures; the bigger vessels are “hens;” the
smaller are “chickens.” Facilities are provided
for the melting of these stolen vessels,
and the metal is sold by the thief&mdash;very rarely if
ever, by the lodging-house keeper, who prefers
dealing with the known customers of the
establishment&mdash;to marine-store buyers.</p>

<p>A man who at one time was a frequenter of
a thieves’ lodging-house, related to me a conversation
which he chanced to overhear&mdash;he
himself being then in what his class would consider
a much superior line of business&mdash;between
a sharp lad, apparently of twelve or thirteen
years of age, and a lodging-house (female)
fence. But it occurred some three or four
years back. The lad had “found” a piece
of Christmas beef, which he offered for sale to
his landlady, averring that it weighed 6 lbs.
The fence said and swore that it wouldn’t
weigh 3 lbs., but she would give him 5<i>d.</i> for it.
It probably weighed above 4 lbs. “Fip-pence!”
exclaimed the lad, indignantly; “you haven’t
no fairness. Vy, its sixpun’ and Christmas
time. Fip-pence! A tanner and a flag (a
sixpence and a four-penny piece) is the werry
lowest terms.” There was then a rapid and
interrupted colloquy, in which the most frequent
words were: “Go to blazes!” with
retorts of “You go to blazes!” and after
strong and oathful imputations of dishonest
endeavours on the part of each contracting
party, to over-reach the other, the meat was sold
to the woman for 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Some of the “fences” board, lodge, and
clothe, two or three boys or girls, and send
them out regularly to thieve, the fence usually
taking all the proceeds, and if it be the young
thief has been successful, he is rewarded with
a trifle of pocket-money, and is allowed plenty
of beer and tobacco.</p>

<p>One man, who keeps three low lodging-houses
(one of which is a beer-shop), not long
ago received from a lodger a valuable great-coat,
which the man said he had taken from a
gig. The fence (who was in a larger way of
business than others of his class, and is reputed
rich,) gave 10<i>s.</i> for the garment, asking at the
same time, “Who was minding the gig?” “A
charity kid,” was the answer. “Give him a
deuce” (2<i>d.</i>), “and stall him off” (send him
an errand), said the fence, “and bring the
horse and gig, and I’ll buy it.” It was done,
and the property was traced in two hours, but
only as regarded the gig, which had already had
a new pair of wheels attached to it, and was so
metamorphosed, that the owner, a medical gentleman,
though he had no moral doubt on the
subject, could not swear to his own vehicle.
The thief received only 4<i>l.</i> for gig and horse;
the horse was never traced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The licentiousness of the frequenters, and
more especially of the juvenile frequenters, of
the low lodging-houses, must be even more
briefly alluded to. In some of these establishments,
men and women, boys and girls,&mdash;but
perhaps in no case, or in very rare cases, unless
they are themselves consenting parties,
herd together promiscuously. The information
which I have given from a reverend informant
indicates the nature of the proceedings,
when the sexes are herded indiscriminately,
and it is impossible to present to the reader,
in full particularity, the records of the vice
practised.</p>

<p>Boys have boastfully carried on loud conversations,
and from distant parts of the room, of
their triumphs over the virtue of girls, and girls
have laughed at and encouraged the recital.
Three, four, five, six, and even more boys and
girls have been packed, head and feet, into one
small bed; some of them perhaps never met
before. On such occasions any clothing seems
often enough to be regarded as merely an incumbrance.
Sometimes there are loud quarrels
and revilings from the jealousy of boys and girls,
and more especially of girls whose “chaps” have
deserted or been inveigled from them. At others,
there is an amicable interchange of partners,
and next day a resumption of their former companionship.
One girl, then fifteen or sixteen,
who had been leading this vicious kind of life
for nearly three years, and had been repeatedly
in prison, and twice in hospitals&mdash;and who expressed
a strong desire to “get out of the life”
by emigration&mdash;said: “Whatever that’s bad
and wicked, that any one can fancy could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
done in such places among boys and girls that’s
never been taught, or won’t be taught, better, <i>is</i>
done, and night after night.” In these haunts
of low iniquity, or rather in the room into which
the children are put, there are seldom persons
above twenty. The younger lodgers in such
places live by thieving and pocket-picking, or
by prostitution. The charge for a night’s lodging
is generally 2<i>d.</i>, but smaller children have
often been admitted for 1<i>d.</i> If a boy or girl
resort to one of these dens at night without the
means of defraying the charge for accommodation,
the “mot of the ken” (mistress of the
house) will pack them off, telling them plainly
that it will be no use their returning until they
have stolen something worth 2<i>d.</i> If a boy or
girl do not return in the evening, and have not
been heard to express their intention of going
elsewhere, the first conclusion arrived at by
their mates is that they have “got into trouble”
(prison).</p>

<p>The indiscriminate admixture of the sexes
among adults, in many of these places, is another
evil. Even in some houses considered of
the better sort, men and women, husbands and
wives, old and young, strangers and acquaintances,
sleep in the same apartment, and if they
choose, in the same bed. Any remonstrance at
some act of gross depravity, or impropriety on the
part of a woman not so utterly hardened as the
others, is met with abuse and derision. One man
who described these scenes to me, and had long
witnessed them, said that almost the only
women who ever hid their faces or manifested
dislike of the proceedings they could not but
notice (as far as he saw), were poor Irishwomen,
generally those who live by begging: “But for
all that,” the man added, “an Irishman or
Irishwoman of that sort will sleep anywhere, in
any mess, to save a halfpenny, though they may
have often a few shillings, or a good many,
hidden about them.”</p>

<p>There is no provision for purposes of decency
in some of the places I have been describing,
into which the sexes are herded indiscriminately;
but to this matter I can only allude. A policeman,
whose duty sometimes called him to enter
one of those houses at night, told me that he
never entered it without feeling sick.</p>

<p>There are now fewer of such filthy receptacles
than there were. Some have been pulled down&mdash;especially
for the building of Commercial-street,
in Whitechapel, and of New Oxford-street&mdash;and
some have fallen into fresh and
improved management. Of those of the worst
class, however, there may now be at least thirty
in London; while the low lodgings of all descriptions,
good or bad, are more frequented
than they were a few years back. A few new
lodging-houses, perhaps half a dozen, have been
recently opened, in expectation of a great influx
of “travellers” and vagrants at the opening
of the Great Exhibition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Children in Low Lodging-houses.</span></h3>

<p>The informant whose account of patterers and
of vagrant life in its other manifestations I have
already given, has written from personal knowledge
and observation the following account of
the children in low lodging-houses:</p>

<p>“Of the mass of the indigent and outcast,”
he says, “of whom the busy world know nothing,
except from an occasional paragraph in
the newspaper, the rising generation, though
most important, is perhaps least considered.
Every Londoner must have seen numbers of
ragged, sickly, and ill-fed children, squatting
at the entrances of miserable courts, streets,
and alleys, engaged in no occupation that is
either creditable to themselves or useful to the
community. These are, in many cases, those
whose sole homes are in the low lodging-houses;
and I will now exhibit a few features
of the ‘juvenile performers’ among the ‘London
Poor.’</p>

<p>“In many cases these poor children have lost
<i>one</i> of their parents; in some, they are without
either father or mother; but even when both
parents are alive, the case is little mended, for
if the parents be of the vagrant or dishonest
class, their children are often neglected, and
left to provide for the cost of their food and
lodging as they best may. The following extract
from the chaplain’s report of one of our
provincial jails, gives a melancholy insight into
the training of many of the families. It is not,
I know, without exception; but, much as we
could wish it to be otherwise, it is so general
an occurrence, varied into its different forms,
that it may be safely accounted as the rule of
action.</p>

<p>“‘J. G. was born of poor parents. At five
years old his father succeeded to a legacy of
500<i>l.</i> He was quiet, indolent, fond of drink, a
good scholar, and had twelve children. He
never sent any of them to school! “Telling
lies,” said the child, “I learned from my
mother; she did things unknown to father,
and gave me a penny not to tell him!” The
father (on leaving home) left, by request of the
mother, some money to pay a man; she slipped
up stairs, and told the children to say she was
out.</p>

<p>“‘From ten to twelve years of age I used to go
to the ale-house. I stole the money from my
father, and got very drunk. My father never
punished me for all this, as he ought to have
done. In course of time I was apprenticed to a
tanner; he ordered me to chapel, instead of
which I used to play in the fields. When out
of my time I got married, and still carried on the
same way, starving my wife and children. I used
to take my little boy, when only five years old, to
the public-house, and make him drunk with
whatever I drank myself. A younger one
could act well a drunken man on the floor. My
wife was a sober steady women; but, through
coming to fetch me home she learned to drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
too. One of our children used to say, “Mam,
you are drunk, like daddy.”’</p>

<p>“It may be argued that this awful ‘family
portrait’ is not the average character, but I have
witnessed too many similar scenes to doubt the
<i>general</i> application of the sad rule.</p>

<p>“Of those children of the poor, as has been
before observed, the most have either no parents,
or have been deserted by them, and have no
regular means of living, nor moral superintendance
on the part of relatives or neighbours;
consequently, they grow up in habits of idleness,
ignorance, vagrancy, or crime. In some
cases they are countenanced and employed.
Here and there may be seen a little urchin
holding a few onions in a saucer, or a diminutive
sickly girl standing with a few laces or a box or
two of lucifers. But even <i>these</i> go with the persons
who have ‘set them up’ daily to the public-house
(and to the lodging-house at night); and
after they have satisfied the cravings of hunger,
frequently expend their remaining halfpence (if
any) in gingerbread, and as frequently in gin. I
have overheard a proposal for ‘half-a-quartern
and a two-out’ (glass) between a couple of shoeless
boys under nine years old. One little fellow
of eleven, on being remonstrated with, said that
it was the only pleasure in life that he had, and
he weren’t a-going to give that up. Both sexes
of this juvenile class frequent, when they can
raise the means, the very cheap and ‘flash’
places of amusement, where the precocious delinquent
acquires the most abandoned tastes, and
are often allured by elder accomplices to commit
petty frauds and thefts.</p>

<p>“Efforts have been made to redeem these
young recruits in crime from their sad career,
with its inevitable results. In some cases, I
rejoice to believe that success has crowned the
endeavour. There is that, however, in the cunning
hardihood of the majority of these immature
delinquents, which presents almost insuperable
barriers to benevolence, and of this I will adduce
an instance.</p>

<p>“A gentleman, living at Islington, who
attends one of the city churches, is in the habit
of crossing the piece of waste ground close to
Saffron-hill. Here he often saw (close to the
ragged school) a herd of boys, and as nearly as
he could judge always the <i>same</i> boys. One of
them always bowed to him as he passed. He
thought&mdash;and thought right&mdash;that they were
gambling, and after, on one occasion, talking to
them very seriously, he gave each of them twopence
and pursued his way. However, he
found himself followed by the boy before
alluded to, accompanied by a younger lad, who
turned out to be his brother. Both in one
breath begged to know if ‘his honour’ could
please to give them any sort of a job. The
gentleman gave them his card, inquired their
place of residence (a low lodging-house) and
the next morning, at nine o’clock, both youths
were at his door. He gave them a substantial
breakfast, and then took them into an outhouse
where was a truss of straw, and having
himself taken off the band, he desired them to
convey the whole, <i>one straw at a time</i>, across the
garden and deposit it in another out-house.
The work was easy and the terms liberal, as
each boy was to get dinner and tea, and one
shilling per day as long as his services should
be required. Their employer had to go to
town, and left orders with one of his domestics
to see that the youths wanted nothing, and to
watch their proceedings; their occupation was
certainly not laborious, but then it was <i>work</i>,
and although that was the first of their requests,
it was also the last of their wishes.</p>

<p>“Taking advantage of an adjoining closet, the
servant perceived that the weight even of a
straw had been too much for these hopeful boys.
They were both seated on the truss, and glibly
recounting some exploits of their own, and how
they had been imposed upon by others. The
eldest&mdash;about fourteen&mdash;was vowing vengeance
upon ‘Taylor Tom’ for attempting to ‘walk
the barber’ (seduce his ‘gal’); while the
younger&mdash;who had scarcely seen eleven summers&mdash;averred
that it was ‘wery good of the
swell to give them summut to eat,’ but ‘precious
bad to be shut up in that crib all day
without a bit o’ backer’. Before the return of
their patron they had transported all the straw
to its appointed designation; as it was very
discernible, however, that this had been effected
by a wholesale process, the boys were admonished,
paid, and dismissed. They are now
performing more ponderous work in one of the
penal settlements. Whether the test adopted
by the gentleman in question was the best that
might have been resorted to, I need not now
inquire.</p>

<p>“It would be grateful to my feelings if in
these disclosures I could omit the misdemeanors
of the other sex of juveniles; but I am obliged
to own, on the evidence of personal observation,
that there are girls of ages varying from eleven
to fifteen who pass the day with a ‘fakement’
before them (‘Pity a poor orphan’), and as soon
as evening sets in, loiter at shop-windows and
ogle gentlemen in public walks, making requests
which might be expected only from long-hardened
prostitution. Their nights are generally
passed in a low lodging-house. They frequently
introduce themselves with ‘Please, sir, can you
tell me what time it is?’ If they get a kindly
answer, some other casual observations prepare
the way for hints which are as unmistakeable
as they are unprincipled.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Low Lodging-houses throughout
the Country.</span></h3>

<p>Further to elucidate this subject, full of importance,
as I have shown, I give an account of
low lodging-houses (or “padding-kens”) at
the “stages” (so to speak) observed by a patterer
“travelling” from London to Birmingham.</p>

<p>I give the several towns which are the usual
sleeping places of the travellers, with the character
and extent of the accommodation provided for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
them, and with a mention of such incidental
matters as seemed to me, in the account I received,
to be curious or characteristic. Circuitous
as is the route, it is the one generally followed.
Time is not an object with a travelling patterer.
“If I could do better in the way of tin,” said
one of the fraternity to me, “in a country village
than in London, why I’d stick to the village&mdash;if
the better tin lasted&mdash;for six months; aye,
sir, for six years. What’s places to a man like
me, between grub and no grub?” It is probable
that on a trial, such a man would soon be
weary of the monotony of a village life; but into
that question I need not now enter.</p>

<p>I give each stage without the repetition of
stating that from “here to there” is so many
miles; and the charge for a lodging is at such
and such a rate. The distance most frequently
“travelled” in a day varies from ten to twenty
miles, according to the proximity of the towns,
and the character and capabilities (for the patterer’s
purposes) of the locality. The average
charge for a lodging, in the better sort of country
lodging-houses, is 4<i>d.</i> a night,&mdash;at others, 3<i>d.</i>
In a slack time, a traveller, for 4<i>d.</i>, has a bed to
himself. In a busy time&mdash;as at fairs or races&mdash;he
will account himself fortunate if he obtain
<i>any</i> share of a bed for 4<i>d.</i> At some of the places
characterised by my informant as “rackety,”
“queer,” or “Life in London,” the charge is as
often 3<i>d.</i> as 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The first stage, then, most commonly attained
on tramp, i<span class="lock">s&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Romford.</i>&mdash;“It’s a good circuit, sir,” said my
principal informant, “and if you want to see life
between from London to Birmingham, why you
can stretch it and see it for 200 miles.” The
Romford “house of call” most frequented by
the class of whom I treat, is the King’s Arms
(a public-house.) There is a back-kitchen for
the use of travellers, who pay something extra
if they choose to resort, and are decent enough
to be admitted, into the tap-room. “Very respectable,
sir,” said an informant, “and a proper
division of married and single, of men and
women. Of course they don’t ask any couple
to show their marriage lines; no more than they
do any lord and lady, or one that ain’t a lady,
if she’s with a lord, at any fash’nable hotel at
Brighton. I’ve done tidy well on slums about
‘ladies in a Brighton hotel,’ just by the Steyne;
werry tidy.” In this house they make up forty
beds; some of them with curtains.</p>

<p><i>Chelmsford.</i>&mdash;The Three Queens (a beer-shop.)
“A rackety place, sir,” said the man, “one of
the showfuls; a dicky one; a free-and-easy.
You can get a pint of beer and a punch of the
head, all for 2<i>d.</i> As for sleeping on a Saturday
night there, ‘O, no, we never mention it.’ It
mayn’t be so bad, indeed it ain’t, as some London
lodging-houses, because there ain’t the
chance, and there’s more known about it.”
Fourteen beds.</p>

<p><i>Braintree.</i>&mdash;The Castle (a beer-shop.) “Takes
in all sorts and all sizes; all colours and all
nations; similar to what’s expected of the Crystal
Palace. I was a <i>muck-snipe</i> when I was
there&mdash;why, a muck-snipe, sir, is a man regularly
done up, coopered, and humped altogether&mdash;and
it was a busyish time, and when the
deputy paired off the single men, I didn’t much
like my bed-mate. He was a shabby-genteel,
buttoned up to the chin, and in the tract line.
I thought of Old Scratch when I looked at him,
though he weren’t a Scotchman, I think. I tipped
the wink to an acquaintance there, and told
him I thought my old complaint was coming on.
That was, to kick and bite like a horse, in my
sleep, a’cause my mother was terrified by a
wicious horse not werry long afore I was born.
So I dozed on the bed-side, and began to whinny;
and my bed-mate jumped up frightened, and
slept on the floor.” Twenty-two beds.</p>

<p><i>Thaxton.</i>&mdash;“A poor place, but I stay two
days, it’s so comfortable and so country, at the
Rose and Crown. It’s a sort of rest. It’s
decent and comfortable too, and it’s about 6<i>d.</i> a
night to me for singing and patter in the tap-room.
That’s my cokum (advantage).” Ten
beds.</p>

<p><i>Saffron Walden.</i>&mdash;The Castle. “Better now&mdash;was
very queer. Slovenly as could be, and
you had to pay for fire, though it was a house of
call for curriers and other tradesmen, but they
never mix with us. The landlord don’t care
much whose admitted, or how they go on.”
Twenty-four beds.</p>

<p><i>Cambridge.</i>&mdash;“The grand town of all. London
in miniature. It would be better but for
the police. I don’t mean the college bull-dogs.
They don’t interfere with us, only with women.
The last time I was at Cambridge, sir, I hung
the Mannings. It was the day, or two days,
I’m not sure which, after their trial. We
pattered at night, too late for the collegians to
come out. We ‘worked’ about where we knew
they lodged&mdash;I had a mate with me&mdash;and some
of the windows of their rooms, in the colleges
themselves, looks into the street. We pattered
about later news of Mr. and Mrs. Manning.
Up went the windows, and cords was let down
to tie the papers to. But we always had the
money first. We weren’t a-going to trust such
out-and-out going young coves as them. One
young gent. said: ‘I’m a sucking parson;
won’t you trust <i>me</i>?’ ‘No,’ says I, ‘we’ll not
trust Father Peter.’ So he threw down 6<i>d.</i> and
let down his cord, and he says, ‘Send six up.’
We saw it was Victoria’s head all right, so we
sends up three. ‘Where’s the others?’ says he.
‘O,’ says I, ‘they’re 1<i>d.</i> a piece, and 1<i>d.</i> a piece
extra for hanging Mr. and Mrs. Manning, as
we have, to a cord; so it’s all right.’ Some
laughed, and some said, ‘D&mdash;n you, wait till I
see you in the town.’ But they hadn’t that
pleasure. Yorkshire Betty’s is the head quarters
at Cambridge,&mdash;or in Barnwell, of course,
there’s no such places in Cambridge. It’s
known as ‘W&mdash; and Muck Fort.’ It’s the
real college touch&mdash;the seat of learning, if you’re
seeing life. The college lads used to look in
there oftener than they do now. They’re get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ting
shyer. Men won’t put up with black eyes
for nothing. Old Yorkshire Betty’s a motherly
body, but she’s no ways particular in her
management. Higgledy-piggledy; men and
women; altogether.” Thirty beds.</p>

<p><i>Newmarket.</i>&mdash;“The Woolpack. A lively
place; middling other ways. There’s generally
money to be had at Newmarket. I don’t
stay there so long as some, for I don’t care
about racing; and the poorest snob there’s a
sporting character.” Six beds.</p>

<p><i>Bury St. Edmund’s.</i>&mdash;“Old Jack Something’s.
He was a publican for forty years. But he
broke, and I’ve heard him say that if he hadn’t
been a player on the fiddle, he should have
destroyed his-self. But his fiddle diverted him
in his troubles. He has a real Cremona, and
can’t he play it? He’s played at dances at the
Duke of Norfolk’s. I’ve heard him give the
tune he played on his wedding night, years and
years back, before I was born. He’s a noble-looking
fellow; the fac-simile of Louis Philippe.
It’s a clean and comfortable, hard and honest
place.” Twelve beds.</p>

<p><i>Mildenhall.</i>&mdash;“A private house; I forget the
landlord’s name. The magistrates is queer
there, and so very little work can be done in
my way. I’ve been there when I was the only
lodger.” Seven beds.</p>

<p><i>Ely.</i>&mdash;“The Tom and Jerry. Very queer.
No back kitchen or convenience. A regular
rough place. Often quarrelling there all night
long. Any caper allowed among men and
women. The landlord’s easy frightened.”
Five beds.</p>

<p><i>St. Ives.</i>&mdash;“Plume of Feathers. Passable.”
Eleven beds.</p>

<p><i>St. Neot’s.</i>&mdash;“Bell and Dicky, and very dicky
too. Queer doings in the dos (sleeping) and
everything. It’s an out-of-the-way place, or the
town’s people might see to it, but they won’t
take any notice unless some traveller complains,
and they won’t complain. They’re a body of
men, sir, that don’t like to run gaping to a
beak. The landlord seems to care for nothing
but money. He takes in all that offer. Three
in a bed often; men, women, and children
mixed together. It’s anything but a tidy
place.” Thirteen beds.</p>

<p><i>Bedford.</i>&mdash;The Cock. “Life in London, sir;
I can’t describe it better. Life in Keate-street,
Whitechapel.” Fifteen beds.</p>

<p><i>Irchester.</i>&mdash;“I don’t mind the name. A most
particular place. You must go to bed by nine,
or be locked out. It’s hard and honest; clean
and rough.” Six beds.</p>

<p><i>Wellingborough.</i>&mdash;“A private house. Smith or
Jones, I know, or some common name. Ducker,
the soldier that was shot in the Park by Annette
Meyers, lived there. I worked him there myself,
and everybody bought. I did the gun-trick,
sir, (had great success.) It’s an inferior
lodging place. They’re in no ways particular,
not they, who they admit or how they dos. At
a fair-time, the goings on is anything but fair.”
Ten beds.</p>

<p><i>Northampton.</i>&mdash;“Mrs. Bull’s. Comfortable and
decent. She takes in the <i>Dispatch</i>, to oblige
her travellers. It’s a nice, quiet, Sunday house.”
Twelve beds.</p>

<p><i>Market Harborough.</i>&mdash;“There’s a good lady
there gives away tracts and half-a-crown. A
private house is the traveller’s house, and some
new name. Middling accommodation.” Nine
beds.</p>

<p><i>Lutterworth.</i>&mdash;“A private house, and I’ll go
there no more. Very queer. Not the least comfort
or decency. They’re above their business,
I think, and take in too many, and care nothing
what the travellers do. Higgledy-piggledy together.”
Ten beds.</p>

<p><i>Leicester.</i>&mdash;“The Rookery. Rosemary-lane
over again, sir, especially at Black Jack’s. He
shakes up the beds with a pitchfork, and brings
in straw if there’s more than can possibly be
crammed into the beds. He’s a fighting man,
and if you say a word, he wants to fight you.”
Twelve beds.</p>

<p><i>Hinckley.</i>&mdash;“The Tea-board. Comfortable.”
Eight beds.</p>

<p><i>Nuneaton.</i>&mdash;“The same style as Hinckley. A
private house.” Eight beds.</p>

<p><i>Coventry.</i>&mdash;“Deserves to be sent further. Bill
Cooper’s. A dilapidated place, and no sleep,
for there’s armies of bugs,&mdash;great black fellows.
I call it the Sikh war there, and they’re called
Sikhs there, or Sicks there, is the vermin; but
I’m sick of all such places. They’re not particular
there,&mdash;certainly not.” Twenty beds.</p>

<p><i>Birmingham.</i>&mdash;“Mrs. Leach’s. Comfortable
and decent, and a good creature. I know there’s
plenty of houses in Birmingham bad enough,&mdash;London
reduced, sir; but I can’t tell you about
them from my own observation, ’cause I always
go to Mrs. Leach’s.” Thirty beds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, in the route most frequented by
the pedestrian “travellers,” we find, taking
merely the accommodation of one house in
each place (and in some of the smaller towns
there is but one), a supply of beds which may
nightly accommodate, on an average, 489 inmates,
reckoning at the rate of 12 sleepers to
every 8 beds. At busy times, double the
number will be admitted. And to these places
resort the beggar, the robber, and the pickpocket;
the street-patterer and the street-trader;
the musician, the ballad-singer, and
the street-performer; the diseased, the blind,
the lame, and the half-idiot; the outcast girl
and the hardened prostitute; young and old,
and of all complexions and all countries.</p>

<p>Nor does the enumeration end here. To these
places must often resort the wearied mechanic,
travelling in search of employment, and even
the broken-down gentleman, or scholar, whose
means do not exceed 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A curious history might be written of the frequenters
of low lodging-houses. Dr. Johnson
relates, that when Dean Swift was a young man,
he paid a yearly visit from Sir William Temple’s
seat, Moor Park, to his mother at Leicester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“He travelled on foot, unless some violence of
weather drove him into a waggon; and at night
he would go to a penny lodging, where he purchased
clean sheets for sixpence. This practice
Lord Orrery imputes to his (Swift’s) innate love
of grossness and vulgarity; some may ascribe it
to his desire of surveying human life through
all its varieties.” Perhaps it might not be very
difficult to trace, in Swift’s works, the influence
upon his mind of his lodging-house experience.</p>

<p>The same author shows that his friend,
Richard Savage, in the bitterness of his poverty,
was also a lodger in these squalid dens: “He
passed the night sometimes in mean houses,
which are set open at night to any casual wanderer;
sometimes in cellars, among the riot and
filth of the meanest and most profligate of the
rabble.” A Richard Savage of to-day might,
under similar circumstances, have the same
thing said of him, except that “cellars” might
now be described as “ground-floors.”</p>

<p>The great, and sometimes the only, luxury of
the frequenters of these country lodging-houses
is tobacco. A man or women who cannot
smoke, I was told, or was not “hardened” to
tobacco smoke, in a low lodging-house was half-killed
with coughing. Sometimes a couple of
men, may be seen through the thick vapour of
the tobacco-smoke, peering eagerly over soiled
cards, as they play at all-fours. Sometimes there
is an utter dulness and drowsiness in the common
sitting-room, and hardly a word exchanged for
many minutes. I was told by one man of experience
in these domiciles, that he had not very
unfrequently heard two men who were conversing
together in a low tone, and probably agreeing
upon some nefarious course, stop suddenly,
when there was a pause in the general conversation,
and look uneasily about them, as if
apprehensive and jealous that they had been
listened to. A “stranger” in the lodging-house
is regarded with a minute and often a rude
scrutiny, and often enough would not be admitted,
were not the lodging-house keeper the
party concerned, and he of course admits “all
what pays.”</p>

<p>One patterer told me of two “inscriptions,”
as he called them, which he had noticed in
country lodgings he had lately visited; the
first <span class="lock">was:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“He who smokes, thinks like a philosopher,
and feels like a philanthropist.”&mdash;<i>Bulwer’s Night
and Morning.</i></p>

<p>The second was an intimation from the proprietor
of the house, which, in spite of its halting
explanation, is easily <span class="lock">understood:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“No sickness allowed, unles by order of the
Mare.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Stationers, and the
Street Card-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>I have before mentioned that the street-stationers&mdash;the
sellers of writing-paper, envelopes,
pens, and of the other articles which constitute
the stationery in the most general demand&mdash;were
not to be confounded with the pattering
“paper-workers.” They are, indeed, a different
class altogether. The majority of them
have been mechanics, or in the employ of
tradesmen whose callings were not mechanical
(as regards handicraft labour), but what is best
described perhaps as commercial; or as selling
but not producing; as in the instances of the
large body of “warehousemen” in the different
departments of trade. One street-stationer
thought that of his entire body, not more
than six had been gentlemen’s servants. He
himself knew four who had been in such employment,
and one only as a boy&mdash;but there
might be six.</p>

<p>The card-sellers are, in the instances I shall
show, more akin to the class of patterers, and
I shall, therefore, give them first. The more
especially as I can so preserve the consecutiveness
of the accounts, in the present number, by
presenting the reader with a sketch of the life
of an informant, in whose revelations I find that
many have taken a strong interest.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Seller of the Penny Short-hand
Cards.</span></h3>

<p>All ladies and gentlemen who “take their
walks abroad,” must have seen, and of course
heard, a little man in humble attire engaged in
selling at one penny each a small card, containing
a few sentences of letter-press, and fifteen
stenographic characters, with an example, by
which, it is asserted, anybody and everybody
may “learn to write short-hand in a few hours.”
With the merits of the production, self-considered,
this is not the place to meddle; suffice
it that it is one of the many ways of getting a
crust common to the great metropolis, and perhaps
the most innocent of all the street performances.
A kind of a street lecture is given by
the vendor, in which the article is sufficiently
puffed off. Of course this lecture is, so to speak,
stereotyped, embracing the same ideas in nearly
the same words over and over and over again.
The exhibitor, however, pleads that the constant
exchange and interchange of passengers, and
his desire to give each and all a fair amount of
information, makes the repetition admissible,
and even necessary. It is here given as a specimen
of the style of the educated “patterer.”</p>


<h4><i>The Lecture.</i></h4>

<p>“Here is an opportunity which has seldom if
ever been offered to the public before, whereby
any person of common intellect may learn to write
short-hand in a few hours, without any aid from
a teacher. The system is entirely my own. It
contains no vowels, no arbitrary characters, no
double consonants, and no terminations; it may
therefore properly be called ‘stenography,’ an
expression which conveys its own meaning; it
is derived from two Greek words; <i>stenos</i>, short,
and <i>grapho</i>, I write, or <i>graphi</i>, the verb <i>to</i> write,
and embraces all that is necessary in fifteen
characters. I know that a prejudice obtains to
a great extent against anything and everything
said or done in the street, but I have nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
do with either the majority or minority of
street pretenders. I am an educated man, and
not a mere pretender, and if the justice or
genuineness of a man’s pretensions would
always lead him to success I had not been here
to-day. But against the tide of human disappointment,
the worthy and the undeserving
are so equally compelled to struggle, and so
equally liable to be overturned by competition,
that till you can prove that wealth is the gauge
of character, it may be difficult to determine
the ability or morality of a man from his position.
I was lately reading an account of the
closing life of that leviathan in literature, Dr.
Johnson, and an anecdote occurred, which I
relate, conceiving that it applies to one of the
points at issue&mdash;I mean the ridicule with which
my little publication has sometimes been
treated by passers-by, who have found it easier
to speculate on the texture of my coat, than on
the character of my language. The Doctor
had a niece who had embraced the peculiarities
of Quakerism; after he had scolded her some
time, and in rather unmeasured terms, her
mother interfered and said, ‘Doctor, don’t scold
the girl&mdash;you’ll meet her in heaven, I hope.’&mdash;‘I
hope not,’ said the Doctor, ‘for I hate to
meet <i>fools</i> anywhere.’ I apply the same observation
to persons who bandy about the expressions
‘gift of the gab,’ ‘catch-penny,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.,
which in my case it is somewhat easier to circulate
than to support. At any rate they ought
to be addressed to <i>me</i> and not to the atmosphere.
The man who meets a foe to the face, gives him
an equal chance of defence, and the sword
openly suspended from the belt is a less dangerous,
because a less cowardly weapon than
the one which, like that of Harmodius, is concealed
under the wreaths of a myrtle.</p>

<p>“If you imagine that professional disappointment
is confined to people out of doors, you are
very much mistaken. Look into some of the
middle-class streets around where we are
standing: you will find here and there,
painted or engraved on a door, the words
‘Mr. So-and-so, surgeon.’ The man I am
pre-supposing shall be qualified,&mdash;qualified
in the technical sense of the expression, a
Member of the College of Surgeons, a Licentiate
of Apothecaries’ Hall, and a Graduate of
some University. He may possess the talent of
Galen or Hippocrates; or, to come to more
recent date, of Sir Astley Cooper himself, but
he never becomes popular, and dies unrewarded
because unknown: before he dies, he may crawl
out of his concealed starvation into such a
thoroughfare as this, and see Professor Morrison,
or Professor Holloway, or the Proprietor
of Parr’s Life Pills, or some other quack, ride
by in their carriage; wealth being brought
them by the same waves that have wafted misfortune
to himself; though that wealth has
been procured by one undeviating system of
Hypocrisy and Humbug, of Jesuitism and
Pantomime, such as affords no parallel since
the disgusting period of Oliverian ascendancy.
Believe me, my friends, a man may form his
plans for success with profound sagacity, and
guard with caution against every approach to
extravagance, but neither the boldness of enterprise
nor the dexterity of stratagem will always
secure the distinction they deserve. Else that
policeman would have been an inspector!</p>

<p>“I have sometimes been told, that if I possessed
the facilities I professedly exhibit, I
might turn them to greater personal advantage:
in coarse, unfettered, Saxon English,
‘That’s a <span class="smcap lowercase">LIE</span>;’ for on the authority of a
distinguished writer, there are 2,000 educated
men in London and its suburbs, who rise every
morning totally ignorant where to find a breakfast.
Now I am not <i>quite</i> so bad as that, so
that it appears I am an exception to the rule,
and not the rule open to exception. However,
it is beyond all controversy, that the best way
to keep the fleas from biting you in bed is to
‘get out of bed;’ and by a parity of reasoning,
the best way for you to sympathize with me for
being on the street is to take me off, as an
evidence of your sympathy. I remember that,
some twenty years ago, a poor man of foreign
name, but a native of this metropolis, made his
appearance in Edinburgh, and advertised that
he would lecture on mnemonics, or the art of
memory. As he was poor, he had recourse to
an humble lecture-room, situated up a dirty
court. Its eligibility may be determined by
the fact that sweeps’ concerts were held in it,
at &frac12;<i>d.</i> per head, and the handbill mostly ended
with the memorable words: ‘N.B.&mdash;No gentleman
admitted without shoes and stockings.’ At
the close of his first lecture (the admission to
which was 2<i>d.</i>), he was addressed by a scientific
man, who gave him 5<i>s.</i>&mdash;(it will relieve the monotony
of the present address if some of you follow
his example)&mdash;and advised him to print and
issue some cards about his design, which he did.
I saw one of them&mdash;the ink on it scarcely dry&mdash;as
he had got it back at the house of a physician,
and on it was inscribed: ‘Old birds are
not caught with chaff. From Dr. M&mdash;&mdash;, an
old bird.’ The suspicious doctor, however, was
advised to hear the poor man’s twopenny lecture,
and was able, at the end of it, to display a
great feat of memory himself. What was the
result? The poor man no longer lectured for
2<i>d.</i> But it is tedious to follow him through a
series of years. He was gradually patronised
throughout the kingdom, and a few months ago
he was lecturing in the Hanover-square Rooms,
with the Earl of Harrowby in the chair. Was
he not as clever a man when he lectured in the
sweeps’ concert-room? Yes; but he had not
been brought <i>under the shadow of a great name</i>.
Sometimes that ‘great name’ comes too late.
You are familiar with the case of Chatterton.
He had existed, rather than lived, three days
on a penny loaf; then he committed suicide,
and was charitably buried by strangers. Fifty
years or more had elapsed, when people found
out how clever he had been, and collected
money for the erection of that monument which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
now stands to his memory by St. Mary Redcliff
Church, in Bristol. Now, if you have any idea
of doing that for me, please to collect some of
it while I am <i>alive</i>!”</p>

<p>On occasions when the audience is not very
liberal, the lecturer treats them to the following
hint:</p>

<p>“When in my golden days&mdash;or at the least
they were silver ones compared to these&mdash;I was
in the habit of lecturing on scientific subjects, I
always gave the introductory lecture <i>free</i>. I
suppose this is an ‘introductory lecture,’ for it
yields very little money at present. I have
often thought, that if everybody a little richer
than myself was half as conscientious, I should
either make a rapid fortune, or have nobody to
listen to me at all; for I never sanction long
with my company anything I don’t believe.
Now, if what I say is untrue or grossly improbable,
it does not deserve the sanction of an
audience; if otherwise, it must be meritorious,
and deserve more efficient sanction. As to any
insults I receive, Christianity has taught me to
forgive, and philosophy to despise them.”</p>

<p>These very curious, and perhaps unique, specimens
of street elocution are of course interrupted
by the occasional sale of a card, and
perhaps some conversation with the purchaser.
The stenographic card-seller states that he has
sometimes been advised to use more commonplace
language. His reply is germane to the
matter. He says that a street audience, like
some other audiences, is best pleased with what
they least understand, and that the way to
appear sublime is to be incomprehensible. He
can occasionally be a little sarcastic. A gentleman
informed me that he passed him at Bagnigge-wells
on one occasion, when he was interrupted
by a “gent.” fearfully disfigured by the
small-pox, who exclaimed: “It’s a complete
humbug.” “No, sir,” retorted Mr. Shorthand,
“but if any of the ladies present were to call you
handsome, <i>that</i> would be a humbug.” On another
occasion a man (half-drunk) had been annoying
him some time, and getting tired of the joke,
said: “Well&mdash;I see you are a learned man, you
must pity my ignorance.” “No,” was the
reply, “but I pity your father.” “Pity my
father!&mdash;why?” was the response. “Because
Solomon says, ‘He that begetteth a fool shall
have sorrow of him.’” This little <i>jeu-d’ésprit</i>,
I was told, brought forth loud acclamations from
the crowd, and a crown-piece from a lady who
had been some minutes a listener. These statements
are among the most curious revelations
of the history of the streets.</p>

<p>The short-hand card-seller, as has partly
appeared in a report I gave of a meeting of
street-folk, makes no secret of having been
fined for obstructing a thoroughfare,&mdash;having
been bound down to keep the peace, and several
times imprisoned as a defaulter. He tells me
that he once “got a month” in one of the metropolitan
jails. It was the custom of the chaplain
of the prison in which he was confined,
to question the prisoners every Wednesday,
from box to box (as they were arranged before
him) on some portion of Holy Writ, and they
were expected, if able, to answer. On one
occasion, the subject being the Excellence of
Prayer, the chaplain, remarked that, “even
among the heathen, every author, without exception,
had commended prayer to a real or supposed
Deity.” The card-seller, I am told,
cried out “Question!” “Who is that?” said
the chaplain. The turnkey pointed out the
questioner. “Yes,” said the card-seller, “you
know what Seneca says:&mdash;‘Quid opus votis?
Fac teipsum felicem, vel bonum.’ ‘What
need of prayer? Make thou thyself happy
and virtuous.’ Does <i>that</i> recommend prayer?”
The prisoners laughed, and to prevent a mutiny,
the classical querist was locked up, and the
chaplain closed the proceedings. It is but
justice, however, to the worthy minister to state,
his querist came out of durance vile better
clothed than he went in.</p>

<p>The stenographic trade, of which the informant
in question is the sole pursuer, was commenced
eleven years ago. At that time 300
cards were sold in a day; but the average is
now 24, and about 50 on a Saturday night.
The card-seller tells me that he is more frequently
than ever interrupted by the police,
and his health being delicate, wet days are
“nuisances” to him. He makes an annual visit
to the country, he tells me, to see his children,
who have been provided for by some kind
friends. About two years ago he was returning
to London and passed through Oxford. He was
“hard up,” he says, having left his coat for
his previous night’s lodging. He attended
prayers (without a coat) at St. Mary’s church,
and when he came out, seated himself on the
pavement beside the church, and wrote with
chalk inside an oval border.</p>

<p>
“<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δε λίμῳ απολλυμαί.</span>”&mdash;Lucam xv. 17.<br />
<br />
“I perish with hunger.”<br />
</p>

<p>He was not long unnoticed, he tells me, by
the scholars; some of whom “rigged him out,”
and he left Oxford with 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> in his pocket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Let us indulge the hope,” writes one who
knows this man well, “that whatever indiscretions
may have brought a scholar, whom few
behold without pity, or converse with without
respect for his acquirements, to be a street-seller,
nevertheless his last days will be his best
days, and that, as his talents are beyond dispute
and his habits strictly temperate, he may yet
arise out of his degradation.”</p>

<p>Of this gentleman’s history I give an account
derived from the only authentic source. It is,
indeed, given in the words of the writer from
whom it was received.&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <i>Reverend</i> Mr. Shorthand” [his real
name is of no consequence&mdash;indeed, it would be
contrary to the rule of this work to print it]
“was born at Hackney, in the county of Middlesex,
on Good Friday, the 15th of April, 1808;
he is, therefore, now in his 43rd year. Of his
parents very little is known; he was brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
by guardians, who were ‘well to do,’ and who
gave him every indulgence and every good instruction
and example. From the earliest dawn
of reason he manifested a strong predilection for
the church; and, before he was seven years old,
he had preached to an infant audience, read
prayers over a dead animal, and performed certain
mimic ceremonies of the church among his
schoolfellows.</p>

<p>“The directors of his youthful mind were
strong Dissenters, of Antinomian sentiments.
With half-a-dozen of the same denomination he
went, before he was thirteen, to the anniversary
meeting of the Countess of Huntingdon’s College,
at Cheshunt. Here, with a congregation of
about forty persons, composed of the students
and a few strangers, he adjourned, while the
parsons were dining at the ‘Green Dragon,’ to
the College Chapel, where, with closed doors, the
future proprietor of the ‘penny short-hand’
delivered his first public sermon.</p>

<p>“Before he was quite fourteen, the stenographic
card-seller was apprenticed to a draper in
or near Smithfield. In this position he remained
only a few months, when the indentures were
cancelled by mutual consent, and he resumed
his studies, first at his native place, and afterwards
as a day-scholar at the Charterhouse. He
was now sixteen, and it was deemed high time
for him to settle to some useful calling. He
became a junior clerk in the office of a stock-broker,
and afterwards amanuensis to an ‘M.D.,’
who encouraged his thirst for learning, and gave
him much leisure and many opportunities for
improvement. While in this position he obtained
two small prizes in the state lottery, gave
up his situation, and went to Cambridge with
a private tutor. As economy was never any
part of his character, he there ‘overrun the
constable,’ and to prevent,” he says, “any constable
running after him. He decamped in the
middle of the night, and came to London by a
waggon&mdash;all his property consisting of a Greek
Prayer-book, Dodd’s Beauties of Shakspere, two
shirts, and two half-crowns.</p>

<p>“At this crisis a famous and worthy clergyman,
forty years resident in Hackney (the Rev. H. H.
N&mdash;&mdash;, lately deceased), had issued from the press
certain strictures against the Society for promoting
Christianity among the Jews. The short-hand
seller wrote an appendix to this work, under the
title of the ‘Church in Danger.’ He took it to
Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;, who praised the performance and
submitted to the publication. The impression
cast off was limited, and the result unprofitable.
It had, however, one favourable issue; it led to
the engagement of its author as private and travelling
tutor to the children of the celebrated
Lady S&mdash;&mdash;, who, though (for adultery) separated
from her husband, retained the exclusive
custody of her offspring. While in this employment,
my informant resided chiefly at Clifton,
sometimes in Bath, and sometimes on her ladyship’s
family property in Derbyshire. While
here, he took deacon’s orders, and became a
popular preacher. In whatever virtues he might
be deficient, his charities, at least, were unbounded.
This profusion ill suited a limited
income, and <i>a forgery</i> was the first step to suspension,
disgrace, and poverty. In 1832 he
married; the union was not felicitous.</p>

<p>“About this date my informant relates, that
under disguise and change of name he supplied
the pulpits of several episcopal chapels in Scotland
with that which was most acceptable to
them. Unable to maintain a <i>locus standi</i> in
connexion with the Protestant church, he made
a virtue of necessity, and avowed himself a
seceder. In this new disguise he travelled and
lectured, proving to a demonstration (always
pecuniary) that ‘the Church of England was
the hospital of Incurables.’</p>

<p>“Always in delicate health, he found continued
journeys inconvenient. The oversight of a home
missionary station, comprising five or six villages,
was advertised; the card-seller was the
successful candidate, and for several years performed
Divine service four times every Sunday,
and opened and taught <i>gratuitously</i> a school for
the children of the poor. Here report says he
was much beloved, and here he ought to have
remained; but with that restlessness of spirit
which is so marked a characteristic of the class
to which he now belongs, he thought otherwise,
and removed to a similar sphere of labour near
Edinburgh. The town, containing a population
of 14,000, was visited to a dreadful extent with
the pestilence of cholera. The future street-seller
(to his honour be it spoken) was the only
one among eight or ten ministers who was not
afraid of the contagion. He visited many hundreds
of cases, and, it is credibly asserted, added
medicine, food, and nursing to his spiritual consolations.
The people of his charge here embraced
the Irving heresy; and unable, as he
says, to determine the sense of ‘the unknown
tongues,’ he resigned his charge, and returned
to London in 1837. After living some time
upon his money, books, and clothes, till all was
expended, he tried his hand at the ‘begging-letter
trade.’ About this time, the card-seller
declares that a man, also from Scotland, and
of similar history and personal appearance,
lodged with him at a house in the Mint, and
stole his coat, and with it his official and other
papers. This person had been either a city
missionary or scripture-reader, having been
dismissed for intemperance. The street card-seller
states that he has ‘suffered much persecution
from the officers of the Mendicity Society,
and in the opinion of the public, by the
blending of his own history with that of the
man who robbed him.’ Be the truth as it may,
or let his past faults have been ever so glaring,
still it furnishes no present reason why he should
be maltreated in the streets, where he is <i>now</i>
striving for an honest living. Since the card-seller’s
return to London, he has been <i>five</i> times
elected and re-elected to a temporary engagement
in the Hebrew School, Goodman’s-fields;
so that, at the worst, his habits of life cannot be
<i>very</i> outrageous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The “pomps and vanities of this wicked
world,” have, according to his own account,
had very little share in the experience of the
short-hand parson. He states, and there is no
reason for doubting him, that he <i>never witnessed
any sort of public amusement in his life</i>; that he
was a hard student when he was young, and
now keeps no company, living much in retirement.
He “attends the ministry,” he says, “of
the Rev. Robert Montgomery,&mdash;reads the daily
lessons at home, and receives the communion
twice every month at the early service in Westminster
Abbey.”</p>

<p>Of course these are matters that appear
utterly inconsistent with his present mode of
life. One well-known peculiarity of this extraordinary
character is his almost idolatrous love
of children, to whom, if he “makes a good
Saturday night,” he is very liberal on his way
home. This is, perhaps, his “ruling passion”
(an acquaintance of his, without knowing why
I inquired, fully confirmed this account); and
it displays itself sometimes in strong emotion,
of which the following anecdote may be
cited as an instance:&mdash;One of his favourite spots
for stenographic demonstration is the corner of
Playhouse-yard, close to the <i>Times</i> office. Directly
opposite lives a tobacconist, who has a
young family. One of his little girls used to
stand and listen to him; to her he was so
strongly attached, that when he heard of her
death (he had missed her several weeks), he
went home much affected, and did not return to
the spot for many months. At the death of
the notorious Dr. Dillon, the card-seller offered
himself to the congregation as a successor; they,
however, declined the overture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sellers of Race Cards and
Lists.</span></h3>

<p>This trade is not carried on in town; but at
the neighbouring races of Epsom and Ascot
Heath, and, though less numerously, at Goodwood,
it is pursued by persons concerned in the
street paper-trade of London.</p>

<p>At Epsom I may state that the race-card sale
is in the hands of two classes (the paper or
sheet-lists sale being carried on by the same
parties)&mdash;viz. those who confine themselves
to “working” the races, and those who only
resort to such work occasionally. The first-mentioned
sellers usually live in the country,
and the second in town.</p>

<p>Between these two classes, there is rather a
strong distinction. The country race-card
sellers are not unfrequently “sporting characters.”
The town professor of the same
calling feels little interest in the intrigues or
great “events” of the turf. Of the country
traders in this line some act also as touters, or
touts; they are for the most part men, who
having been in some capacity or other, connected
with racing or with race-horses, and
having fallen from their position or lost their
employment, resort to the selling of race-cards
as one means of a livelihood, and to touting,
or watching race-horses, and reporting anything
concerning them to those interested, as another
means. These men, I am assured, usually
“make a book” (a record and calculation of
their bets) with grooms, or such gentlemen’s
servants, as will bet with them, and sometimes
one with another.</p>

<p>The most notorious of the race-card selling
fraternity is known as Captain Carrot. He is
the successor, I am told, of Gentleman Jerry,
who was killed some time back at Goodwood
races&mdash;having been run over. Gentleman Jerry’s
attire, twenty-five to thirty-five years ago, was
an exaggeration of what was then accounted a
gentleman’s style. He wore a light snuff-coloured
coat, a “washing” waistcoat of any
colour, cloth trowsers, usually the same colour
as his coat, and a white, or yellow white, and
ample cravat of many folds. His successor
wears a military uniform, always with a scarlet
coat, Hessian boots, an old umbrella, and a tin
eye-glass. Upon the card-sellers, however, who
confine their traffic to races, I need not dwell,
but proceed to the metropolitan dealers, who are
often patterers when in town.</p>

<p>It is common, for the smarter traders in
these cards to be liberal of titles, especially to
those whom they address on the race-ground.
“This is the sort of style, sir,” said one race-card-seller
to me, “and it tells best with
cockneys from their shops. ‘Ah, my lord. I
hope your lordship’s well. I’ve backed your
horse, my lord. He’ll win, he’ll win. Card, my
lord, correct card, only 6<i>d.</i> I’ll drink your lordship’s
health after the race.’ Perhaps this here
‘my lord,’ may be a barber, you see, sir, and
never had so much as a donkey in his life, and
he forks out a bob; but before he can get his
change, there always <i>is</i> somebody or other to
call for a man like me from a little distance,
so I’m forced to run off and cry, ‘Coming, sir,
coming. Coming, your honour, coming.’”</p>

<p>The mass of these sellers, however, content
themselves with the customary cry: “Here’s
Dorling’s Correct Card of the Races.&mdash;Names,
weights, and colours of the Riders.&mdash;Length of
Bridle, and Weight of Saddle.”</p>

<p>One intelligent man computed that there were
500 men, women, and children, of all descriptions
of street-callings, who on a “Derby day”
left London for Epsom. Another considered
that there could not be fewer than 600, at the
very lowest calculation. Of these, I am informed,
the female sellers may number something
short of a twentieth part from London,
while a twelfth of the whole number of regular
street-sellers attending the races vend at the
races cards. But card-selling is often a cloak,
for the females&mdash;and especially those connected
with men who depend solely on the races&mdash;vend
improper publications (usually at 6<i>d.</i>), making
the sale of cards or lists a pretext for the more
profitable traffic.</p>

<p>If a man sell from ten to twelve dozen cards
on the “Derby day,” it is accounted “a good
day;” and so is the sale of three-fourths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that quantity on the Oaks day. On the other,
or “off” days, 2<i>s.</i> is an average earning.</p>

<p>The cards are all bought of Mr. Dorling, the
printer, at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a dozen. The price asked is
always 6<i>d.</i> each. “But those fourpenny bits,”
said one card-seller, “is the ruination of every
thing. And now that they say that the threepenny
bits is coming in more, things will be
wuss and wuss.” The lists vary from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, according to size. To
clear 10<i>s.</i> and 8<i>s.</i> on the two great days is
accounted “tidy doings,” but that is earned
only by those who devote themselves to the
sale of the race-cards, which all the sellers
do not. Some, for instance, are ballad-singers,
who sell cards immediately before a race
comes off, as at that time they could obtain no
auditory for their melodies. Ascot-heath races,
I am told, are rather better for the card seller than
Epsom, as “there’s more of the nobs there,”
and fewer of the London vendors of cards. The
sale of the “lists” is less than one-eighth that
of the sale of cards. They are chiefly “return
lists,” (lists with a specification of the winning
horses, &amp;c., “returned” as they acquitted
themselves in each race), and are sold in the
evening, or immediately after the conclusion of
the “sport,” for the purpose of being posted or
kept.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Gelatine, of
Engraved, and of Playing Cards, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>There are yet other cards, the sale of which is
carried on in the streets; of these, the principal
traffic has lately been in “gelatines” (gelatine
cards). Those in the greatest demand contain
representations of the Crystal Palace, the outlines
of the structure being given in gold delineation
on the deep purple, or mulberry, of the
smooth and shining gelatine. These cards are
sold in blank envelopes, for the convenience of
posting them as a present to a country friend;
or of keeping them unsoiled, if they are retained
as a memento of a visit to so memorable a building.
The principal sale was on Sunday mornings,
in Hyde Park, and to the visitors who
employed that day to enjoy the sight of the
“palace.” But on the second Sunday in February&mdash;as
well as my informant could recollect,
for almost all street-traders will tell you, if not
in the same words as one patterer used, that
their recollections are “not worth an old button
without a neck”&mdash;the police “put down” the
sale of these Exhibition cards in the Park, as
well as that of cakes, tarts, gingerbread, and
such like dainties. This was a bitter disappointment
to a host of street-sellers, who looked
forward very sanguinely to the profits they might
realise when the Great Exhibition was in full
operation, and augured ill to their prospects from
this interference. I am inclined to think, that,
on this occasion, the feelings of animosity entertained
by the card-sellers towards the police
and the authorities were even bitterer than I
have described as affecting the costermongers.
“Why,” said one man, “when I couldn’t be
let sell my cards, I thrust my hands into my
empty pockets, and went among the crowd near
the Great Exhibition place to look about me.
There was plenty of ladies and gentlemen&mdash;say
about 12 o’clock at Sunday noon, and as many
as could be. Plenty of ’em had nice paper bags
of biscuits, or cakes, that, of course, they’d
bought that morning at a pastrycook’s, and they
handed ’em to their party. Some had newspapers
they was reading&mdash;about the Exhibition,
I dare say&mdash;papers which was bought, and, perhaps,
was printed that very blessed morning;
but for us to offer to earn a crust then&mdash;oh, it’s
agen the law. In course it is.”</p>

<p>Some of the gelatine cards contain pieces of
poetry, in letters of gold, always&mdash;at least, I
could hear of no exceptions&mdash;of a religious or
sentimental character. “A Hymn,” “The
Child’s Prayer,” “The Christian’s Hope,” “To
Eliza,” “To a Daisy,” “Forget-me-not,” and
“Affection’s Tribute,” were among the titles.
Some contained love-verses, and might be used
for valentines, and some a sentimental song.</p>

<p>In the open-air sale, nearly all the traffic was
in “Exhibition gelatines,” and the great bulk
were sold in and near Hyde Park. For two or
three months, from as soon as the glass palace
had been sufficiently elevated to command public
attention, there were daily, I am told, 20
persons selling those cards in the Park and its
vicinity, and more than twice that number on
Sundays. One man told me, that, on one fine
bright Sunday, the sale being principally in the
morning, he had sold 10 dozen, with a profit of
about 5<i>s.</i> On week-days three dozen was a
good sale; but on wet, cold, or foggy days, none
at all could be disposed of. If, therefore, we
take as an average the sale of two dozen daily
per each individual, and three dozen on a Sunday,
we find that 180<i>l.</i> was expended on street-sold
“gelatines.” The price to the retailer is
5<i>d.</i> a dozen, with 1<i>d.</i> or 1&frac14;<i>d.</i> for a dozen of the
larger-sized envelopes, so leaving the usual
profit&mdash;cent. per cent. The sellers were not a
distinct class, but in the hands of the less enterprising
of the paper-workers or patterers. The
“poetry gelatines” were hardly offered at all in
the streets, except by a few women and children,
with whom it was a pretext for begging.</p>

<p>Of “engraved” Exhibition-cards, sold under
similar circumstances, there might be one third
as many sold as of the gelatines, or an expenditure
of 60<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The sale of playing-cards is only for a brief
interval. It is most brisk for a couple of weeks
before Christmas, and is hardly ever attempted
in any season but the winter. The price varies
from 1<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>, but very rarely 6<i>d.</i>; and
seldom more than 3<i>d.</i> the pack. The sellers
for the most part announce their wares as
“New cards. New playing-cards. Two-pence
a pack.” This subjects the sellers (the cards
being unstamped) to a penalty of 10<i>l.</i>, a matter
of which the street-traders know and care
nothing; but there is no penalty on the sale of
second-hand cards. The best of the cards are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
generally sold by the street-sellers to the landlords
of the public-houses and beer-shops where
the customers are fond of a “hand at cribbage,”
a “cut-in at whist,” or a “game at all
fours,” or “all fives.” A man whose business
led him to public-houses told me that for
some years he had not observed any other
games to be played there, but he had heard an
old tailor say that in his youth, fifty years ago,
“put” was a common public-house game.
The cheaper cards are frequently imperfect
packs. If there be the full number of fifty-two,
some perhaps are duplicates, and others
are consequently wanting. If there be an ace
of spades, it is unaccompanied by those flourishes
which in the duly stamped cards set off the
announcement, “Duty, One Shilling;” and
sometimes a blank card supplies its place.
The smaller shop-keepers usually prefer to sell
playing-cards with a piece cut off each corner,
so as to give them the character of being
second-hand; but the street-sellers prefer vending
them without this precaution. The cards&mdash;which
are made up from the waste and spoiled
cards of the makers&mdash;are bought chiefly, by the
retailers, at the “swag shops.”</p>

<p>Playing cards are more frequently sold with
other articles&mdash;such as almanacks&mdash;than otherwise.
From the information I obtained, it appears
that if twenty dozen packs of cards are
sold daily for fourteen days, it is about the
quantity, but rather within it. The calculation
was formed on the supposition that there might
be twenty street playing-card sellers, each disposing
(allowing for the hinderances of bad
weather, &amp;c.), of one dozen packs daily.
Taking the average price at 3<i>d.</i> a pack, we find
an outlay of 42<i>l.</i> The sale used to be far more
considerable and at higher prices, and was
“often a good spec. on a country round.”</p>

<p>There is still another description of cards sold
in the streets of London; viz., conversation-cards;
but the quantity disposed of is so trifling
as to require no special comment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Stationery.</span></h3>

<p>Of this body of street-traders there are two
descriptions, the itinerant and the “pitching.”
There are some also who unite the two qualities,
so far as that they move a short distance,
perhaps 200 yards, along a thoroughfare, but
preserve the same locality.</p>

<p>Of the itinerant again, there are some who,
on an evening, and more especially a Saturday
evening, take a stand in a street-market, and
pursue their regular “rounds” the other portions
of the day.</p>

<p>The itinerant trader carries a tray, and in no
few cases, as respects the “display” of his
wares, emulates the tradesman’s zeal in “dressing”
a window temptingly. The tray most in
use is painted, or mahogany, with “ledges,”
front and sides; or, as one man described it,
“an upright four-inch bordering, to keep
things in their places.” The back of the tray,
which rests against the bearer’s breast, is about
twelve inches high. Narrow pink tapes are
generally attached to the “ledges” and back,
within which are “slipped” the articles for
sale. At the bottom of the tray are often
divisions, in which are deposited steel pens,
wafers, wax, pencils, pen-holders, and, as one
stationer expressed it, “packable things that
you can’t get much show out of.” One man&mdash;who
rather plumed himself on being a thorough
master of his trade&mdash;said to me: “It’s
a grand point to display, sir. Now, just take it
in this way. Suppose you yourself, sir, lived
in my round. Werry good. You hear me cry
as I’m a approaching your door, and suppose
you was a customer, you says to yourself:
‘Here’s Penny-a-quire,’ as I’m called oft
enough. And I’ll soon be with you, and I
gives a extra emphasis at a customer’s door.
Werry good, you buys the note. <i>As</i> you buys
the note, you gives a look over my tray, and
then you says, ‘O, I want some steel pens, and
is your ink good?’ and you buys some. But
for the ‘display,’ you’d have sent to the shopkeeper’s,
and I should have lost custom, ’cause
it wouldn’t have struck you.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The articles more regularly sold by the
street-sellers of stationery are note-paper, letter-paper,
envelopes, steel pens, pen-holders, sealing-wax,
wafers, black-lead pencils, ink in
stonebottles, memorandum-books, almanacks,
and valentines. Occasionally, they sell India-rubber,
slate-pencil, slates, copy-books, story-books,
and arithmetical tables.</p>

<p>The stationery is purchased, for the most part,
in Budge-row and Drury-lane. The half-quires
(sold at 1<i>d.</i>) contain, generally, 10 sheets; if the
paper, however, be of superior quality, only 8
sheets. In the paper-warehouses it is known as
“outsides,” with no more than 10 sheets to the
half quire, the price varying from 4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> the
ream (20 quires); or, if bought by weight, from
7<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> the pound. The envelopes are sold
(wholesale) at from 6<i>d.</i> to 15<i>d.</i> the dozen; the
higher-priced being adhesive, and with impressions&mdash;now,
generally, the Crystal Palace&mdash;on
the place of the seal. The commoner are retailed
in the streets at 12, and the better at 6, a penny.
Sometimes “a job-lot,” soiled, is picked up by
the street-stationer at 4<i>d.</i> a pound. The sealing,
a pound, retailed at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each; the “flat” wax,
however, is 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per lb., containing from 30 to
36 sticks, retailed at 1<i>d.</i> each. Wafers (at the
same swag shops) are 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> the lb.&mdash;in small
boxes, 9<i>d.</i> the gross; ink, 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 5<i>d.</i> the dozen
bottles; pencils, 7<i>d.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> a gross; and steel
pens from 4<i>d.</i> (waste) to 3<i>s.</i> a gross; but the
street-stationers do not go beyond 2<i>s.</i> the gross,
which is for magnum bonums.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Street-stationer.</span></h3>

<p>A middle-aged man gave me the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
account. He had pursued the trade for upwards
of twelve years. He was a stout, cosey-looking
man, wearing a loose great coat. The back of
his tray rested against his double-breasted waistcoat;
the pattern of which had become rather
indistinct, but which was buttoned tightly up to
his chin, as if to atone for the looseness of his
coat. The corner of his mouth, toward his left
ear, was slightly drawn down, for he seemed in
“crying” to pitch his voice (so that it could be
heard a street off) out of the corner of his only
partially-opened mouth.</p>

<p>“Middlin’, sir,” he said, “times is middlin’
with me; they might be better, but then they
might be worse. I can manage to live. The
times is changed since I was first in the business.
There wasn’t no ’velops (envelopes) then,
and no note-paper&mdash;least I had none; but I
made as good or a better living than I do now;
a better indeed. When the penny-postage came
in&mdash;I don’t mind the year, but I hadn’t been
long in the trade [it was in 1840]&mdash;I cried some
of the postage ’velops. They was big, figured
things at first, with elephants and such like on
them, and I called them at prime cost, if anything
was bought with ’em. The very first time,
a p’liceman says, ‘You mustn’t sell them covers.
What authority have you to do it?’ ‘Why, the
authority to earn a dinner,’ says I; but it was
no go. Another peeler came up and said I
wasn’t to cry them again, or he’d have me up;
and so that spec. came to nothing. I sell to
ladies and gentlemen, and to servant-maids, and
mechanics, and their wives; and indeed all sorts
of people. Some fine ladies, that call me to the
door on the sly, do behave very shabby. Why,
there was one who wanted five half-quire of note
for 4<i>d.</i>, and I told her I couldn’t afford it, and
so she said ‘that she knew the world, and never
gave nobody the price they first asked.’ ‘If
that’s it, ma’am,’ says I, ‘people that knows
your plan can ’commodate you.’ That knowing
card of a lady, sir, as she reckons herself, had
as much velvet to her body&mdash;such a gown!&mdash;as
would pay <i>my</i> tailor’s bills for twenty year.
But I don’t employ a fashionable tailor, and
can patch a bit myself, as I was two years with
a saddler, and was set to work to make girths
and horse-clothes. My master died, and all
went wrong, and I had to turn out, without nobody
to help me,&mdash;for I had no parents living;
but I was a strong young fellow of sixteen. I
first tried to sell a few pairs of girths, and a
roller or two, to livery-stable keepers, and horse-dealers,
and job-masters. But I was next to
starving. They wouldn’t look at anything but
what was good, and the stuff was too high, and
the profit too little&mdash;for I couldn’t get regular
prices, in course&mdash;and so I dropped it. There’s
no men in the world so particular about good
things as them as is about vallyable horses.
I’ve often thought if rich people cared half as
much about poor men’s togs, that was working
for them for next to nothing, as they cared
for their horse-clothes, it would be a better
world. I was dead beat at last; but I went
down to Epsom and sold a few race-cards. I’d
borrowed 1<i>s.</i> of a groom to start with, and he
wouldn’t take it back when I offered it; and that
wax is bought at general warehouses, known as
“swag shops” (of which I may speak hereafter),
at 8<i>d.</i> the pound, there being 48 round sticks in,
was my beginning in the paper trade. I felt
queer at first, and queerer when I wasn’t among
horses, as at the races like&mdash;but one get’s reconciled
to anything, ’cept, to a man like me, a low
lodging-house. A stable’s a palace to it. I got
into stationery at last, and it’s respectable.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard people say how well they could
read and write, and it was no good to them.
It has been, and is still, a few pence to me;
though I can only read and write middlin’. I
write notes and letters for some as buys paper
of me. Never anything in the beggin’ way&mdash;never.
It wouldn’t do to have my name mixed
up that way. I’ve often got extra pennies for
directing and doing up valentines in nice ’velops.
Why, I spoke to a servant girl the other day;
she was at the door, and says I, ‘Any nice paper
to-day, to answer your young man’s last love-letter,
or to write home and ask your mother’s
consent to your being wed next Monday week?’
That’s the way to get them to listen, sir. Well,
I finds that she can’t write, and so I offers to do
it for a pint of beer, and she to pay for paper of
course. And then there was so many orders
what to say. Her love to no end of aunts, and
all sorts of messages and inquiries about all
sorts of things; and when I’d heard enough to
fill a long ‘letter’ sheet, she calls me back and
says, ‘I’m afraid I’ve forgot uncle Thomas.’
I makes it all short enough in the letter, sir.
‘My kind love to all inquiring friends,’ takes in
all uncle Thomases. I writes them when I gets
a bite of dinner. Sometimes I posts them, if
I’m paid beforehand; at other times I leaves
them next time I pass the door. There’s no
mystery made about it. If a missus says,
‘What’s that?’ I’ve heard a girl answer, ‘It’s
a letter I’ve got written home, ma’am. I haven’t
time myself,’ or ‘I’m no scholar, ma’am.’ But
that’s only where I’m known. I don’t write
one a week the year round&mdash;perhaps forty in a
year. I charge 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i>, or if it’s a very poor
body, and no gammon about it, nothing. Well,
then, I think I never wrote a love-letter. Women
does that one for another, I think, when the
young housemaid can’t write as well as she can
talk. I jokes some as I knows, and says I writes
all sorts of letters but love-letters, and for them,
you see, says I, there’s wanted the best gilt
edge, and a fancy ’velop, and a Dictionary. I
take more for note and ’velops than anything
else, but far the most for note. Some has a sheet
folded and fitted into a ’velop when they buys,
as they can’t fit it so well theirselves, they say.
Perhaps I make 2<i>s.</i> a day, take it all round.
Some days I may make as much as 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; at
others, ’specially wet days, not 1<i>s.</i> But I call
mine a tidy round, and better than an average.
I’ve only myself, and pays 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a week for a
tidy room, with a few of my own sticks in it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
buy sometimes in Budge-row, and sometimes in
Drury-lane. Very seldom at a swag-shop (Birmingham
house), for I don’t like them.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’ve heard, sir, that poor men
like me ain’t to be allowed to sell anything in
the Park at the Great Exhibition. How’s that,
sir?” I told him I could give no information
on the subject.</p>

<p>“It’s likely enough to be true,” he resumed;
“the nobs’ll want to keep it all to theirselves.
I read <i>Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper</i> on a Sunday,
and what murders and robberies there is now!
What will there be when the Great Exhibition
opens! for rogues is worst in a crowd, and they
say they’ll be plenty come to London from all
arts and parts? Never mind; if I can see anything
better to do in a fair way at the Exhibition,
I’ll cut the streets.</p>

<p>“Perhaps my earnings is half from working
people and half from private houses; that’s about
it. But working people’s easiest satisfied.”</p>

<p>I have given this man’s statement more fully
than I should have thought necessary, that I
might include his account of letter-writing.
The letter-writer was at one period a regular
street-labourer in London, as he is now in some
continental cities&mdash;Naples, for instance. The
vocation in London seems in some respects to
have fallen into the hands of the street-stationer,
but the majority of letters written for the uneducated&mdash;and
their letter-receiving or answering
is seldom arduous&mdash;is done, I believe, by
those who are rather vaguely but emphatically
described as&mdash;“friends.”</p>

<p>I am told that there are 120 street-stationers
in London, a small majority of whom may be
itinerant, but chiefly on regular rounds. On a
Sunday morning, in such places as the Brill,
are two or three men, but not regularly, who sell
stationery only on Sunday mornings. Taking
the number, however, at 120, I am assured that
their average profits may be taken at 8<i>s.</i> weekly,
each stationer. On note-paper of the best sort
the profit is sometimes only 50 per cent.; but,
take the trade altogether, we may calculate it at
cent. per cent. (on some things it is higher);
and we find 4,992<i>l.</i> yearly expended in street-stationery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a “reduced” Gentlewoman, and a “reduced”
Tradesman, as Street-sellers
of Stationery.</span></h3>

<p>I now give two statements, which show the correctness
of my conclusion, that among the street-stationers
were persons of education who had
known prosperity, and that, as a body, those
engaged in this traffic were a better class than
the mass of the “paper-workers.” They are
also here cited as illustrations of the causes which
lead, or rather force, many to a street-life.</p>

<p>The first statement is that of a <span class="lock">lady:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My father,” she said, “was an officer in the
army, and related to the Pitt family. After his
death, I supported myself by teaching music. I
was considered very talented by my profession,
both as teacher and composer.” (I may here interrupt
the course of the narrative by saying, that
I myself have had printed proofs of the lady’s
talents in this branch of art.) “A few years ago,
a painful and protracted illness totally incapacitated
me from following my profession; consequently,
I became reduced to a state of great
destitution. For many weeks I remained ill in
my own room. I often, during that time, went
without nourishment the day through. I might
have gone into an hospital; but I seemed to
dread it so much, that it was not until I was
obliged to give up my room that I could make
up my mind to enter one. From that time,
until within a few weeks ago, I have been an
inmate of several hospitals: the last I was in
was the Convalescent Establishment at Carshalton.
On my coming to London, I found I had
to begin the world again, as it were, in a very different
manner from what I have been accustomed
to. I had no head to teach&mdash;I felt that; and
what to do I hardly knew. I had no home to
go to, and not a halfpenny in the world. I had
heard of the House of Charity, in Soho-square,
and, as a last resource, I went there; but before
I could have courage to ask admittance, I got a
woman to go in and see what kind of a place it was&mdash;I
seemed to fear it so much. I met with
great kindness there, however; and, by the time
I left, the care they had bestowed upon me had
restored my health in a measure, but not my
head. The doctors advised me to get some out-door
occupation (I am always better in the open
air); but what to do I could not tell. At last
I thought of a man I had known, who made
fancy envelopes. I went to him, and asked him
to allow me to go round to a few houses with
some of them for a small per centage. This he
did, and I am thereby enabled, by going along
the streets and calling to offer my envelopes at
any likely house, just to live. None but those
who have suffered misfortunes (as I have done)
can tell what my feelings were on first going to
a house. I <i>could</i> not go where I was known; I
had not the courage, nor would my pride allow
me. My pupils had been very kind to me during
my illnesses, but I could not bear the idea of
going to them and offering articles for sale.</p>

<p>“My fear of strangers is so great, that I
tremble when I knock at a door&mdash;lest I should
meet with an angry word. How few have any idea
of the privations and suffering that have been
endured before a woman (brought up as I have
been) can make up her mind to do as I am
obliged to do! I am now endeavouring to raise
a little money to take a room, and carry on the
envelope business myself. I might do pretty
well, I think; and, should my head get better,
in time I might get pupils again. At present I
could not teach, the distressed state of my mind
would not allow me.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tradesman’s statement he forwarded to
me in writing, supplying me with every facility
to test the full accuracy of his assertions, which
it is right I should add I have done, and found
all as he has stated. I give the narrative in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
writer’s words (and his narrative will be found
at once diffuse and minute), as a faithful representation
of a “reduced” tradesman’s struggles,
thoughts, and endurances, before being forced
into the streets.</p>

<p>“I was brought up,” he writes, “as a linen-draper.
After filling every situation as an
assistant, both in the wholesale and retail trade,
I was for a considerable time in business.
Endeavouring to save another from ruin, I advanced
what little money I had at my banker’s,
and became security for more, as I thought I
saw my way clear. But a bond of judgment
was hanging over the concern (kept back from
me of course) and the result was, I lost my
money to the amount of some hundreds, of
which I have not recovered one pound. Since
that time I have endeavoured to gain a livelihood
as a town traveller. In 1845 I became
very much afflicted, and the affliction continued
the greater part of the following year. At one
time I had fifteen wounds on my body, and lost
the use of one side. I was reduced by bodily
disease, as well as in circumstances. My wife
went to reside among her friends, and I, after
my being an out-patient of Bartholomew’s Hospital
went, through necessity, to Clerkenwell
Workhouse. When recovered, I made another
effort to do something among my own trade,
and thought, after about two years struggle, I
should recover in a measure my position. In
August, 1849, I sent for a few shillings-worth
of light articles from London (being then at
Dunstable). I received them, and sold one
small part; I went the following day to the next
village nearer London. There I had a violent
attack of cholera; which once more defeated
my plans, leaving me in a weak condition.
I was obliged to seek the refuge of my parish,
and consider that very harshly was I treated
there. They refused me admittance, and suffered
me to walk the street two days and two
nights. I had no use of my arm, was ill and
disabled. About half-past seven on the third
night, a gentleman, hearing of my sufferings,
knocked at the door of the Union, took me inside,
and dared them to turn me thence. This was in
October, 1849. I lay on my bed there for seven
weeks nearly, and a few days before Christmas-day
the parish authorities brought me before the
Board, and turned me out, with one shilling and
a loaf; one of the overseers telling me to go to
h&mdash;ll and lodge anywhere. I came to lodge at
the Model Lodging-house, King-street, Drury-lane;
but being winter-time they were full.
Although I remained there in the day-time,
I was obliged to sleep at another house. At
this domicile I saw how many ways there were
of getting what the very poor call a living, and
various suggestions were offered. I was promised
a gift of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> by an individual, on a
certain day,&mdash;but I had to live till that day, and
many were the feelings of my mind, how to dispose
of what might remain when I received the
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, as I was getting a little into debt. My
debt, when paid, left me but 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> out of the
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to trade with. I had never hawked an
article before that time; to stand the streets
was terrible to my mind, and how to invest this
small sum sadly perplexed me. My mind was
racked by painful anxiety; one moment almost
desponding, the next finding so much sterling
value in a shilling, that I saw in it the means
of rescuing me from my degradation. Wanting
many of the necessaries of life, but without
suitable attire for my own business, and still
weak from illness, I made up my mind. On the
afternoon of 2nd Jan., 1850, I purchased 1&frac12; doz.
memorandum-books, of a stationer in Clerkenwell,
telling him my capital. I obtained the name
of ‘Ninepence-halfpenny Man’ (the amount of
my funds) at that shop. The next step was how
to dispose of my books. I thought I would go
round to some coffee and public-houses, as I
could not endure the streets. I went into one,
where I was formerly known, and sold 6<i>d.</i>-worth,
and meeting a person who was once in my own
line, at another house, I sold 4<i>d.</i>-worth more.
The first night, therefore, I got over well. The
next day I did a little, but not so well, and I
found out that what I had bought was not the
most ready sale. My returns that week were
only 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> I found I must have something
different,&mdash;one thing would not do alone; so I
bought a few childrens’ books and almanacks&mdash;sometimes
going to market with as little as seven
farthings. I could not rise to anything better
in the way of provisions during this time than
dry toast and coffee, as the rent must be looked
to. I struggled on, hoping against hope. At one
period I had a cold and lost my voice. Two or
three wet days in a week made me a bankrupt.
If I denied myself food, to increase my stock,
and went out for a day or two to some near
town, I found that with small stock and small
returns I could not stem the tide.</p>

<p>“I always avoided associating with any but
those a step higher in the grades of society&mdash;a circumstance
that caused me not to know as much
of the market for my cheap articles as I might
have done. I am perhaps looked on as rather an
‘aristocrat,’ as I am not often seen by the street-sellers
at a stand. My difficulties have been of no
ordinary kind; with a desire for more domestic
comfort on one hand, and painful reflections
from want of means on the other, I have had
to call to my aid all the philosophy I possess,
to keep up a proper equilibrium, lest I should
be tempted to anything derogatory or dishonest.
I am desirous of a rescue at the only time
likely for it to take place with advantage, as I
am persuaded when persons continue long in
a course that endangers their principles and
self-respect, a rescue becomes hopeless. Should
I have one small start with health, the privations
I have undergone show not what comforts
I have had, or may hope ever to have, but what
I can absolutely do without.</p>

<p>“I found the first six months not quite so
good as the latter; March and May being the
worst. The entire amount taken from January
2nd to December 31st, 1850; was 28<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
average of about 11<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a week; say for
cost of goods, 6<i>s.</i> per week; and rent, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>;
leaving me but 3<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> clear for living. This
statement, sir, is strictly correct, as I do not get
cent. per cent. on all the articles; and yet with
so small a return I am not behind one single
crown at the present time.</p>

<p>“On New Year’s-day last, I had but the
cost price of stock, 5<i>d.</i> Up to the evening of
February 10th, I have taken 2<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>;&mdash;having
paid for goods, 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; and for
rent, 8<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>: leaving me 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>d.</i> to exist on
during nearly six weeks. These facts and
figures show that without a little assistance it
is impossible to rise; and remember this circumstance&mdash;I
have had to walk on some occasions
as much as twenty or twenty-two miles
in a day. If those whom Providence has
blessed with a little more than their daily
wants would only enter into the conflicts of
the really reduced person, they would not be
half so niggardly in spending a few coppers
for useful articles, at least, nor overbearing in
their requirements as to bulk, when purchasing
of the itinerant vendor. Did they but reflect
that they themselves might be in the same
condition, or some of their families, I am sure
they would not act as they do; for I would
venture to say that the common street beggar
does not get more rebuffs or insults than the
educated and unfortunate reduced tradesmen
in the streets. The past year has been one
of the most trying and painful, yet I hope
instructive, periods of my existence, and one of
which I trust I never shall see the like again.”</p>

<p>I subjoin one of the testimonies that have
been furnished me, as to this man’s character,
and which I thought it right to procure before
giving publicity to the above statement. It is
from a minister of the gospel&mdash;the street-seller’s
father-in-law.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received a letter, last Tuesday, from
Mr. Knight, intimating that he was requested by you
to inquire into the character of Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; N&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>“It is quite correct, as he states, that his wife is
my daughter. They lived together several years in
London; but eventually, notwithstanding her efforts
in the millinery and straw-work, they became so
reduced that their circumstances obliged my daughter
to take her two little girls with herself to us.</p>

<p>“This was in the summer, 1845. His wife and children
have been of no expense to Mr. N. since that
time. The sole cause of their separation was poverty.</p>

<p>“I consider him to have acted imprudently in giving
up his situation to depend on an income arising from a
small capital; whereas, if he had kept in a place, whilst
she attended to her own business, they might have
gone on comfortably; and should they, through the
interposition of a kind Providence, gain that position
again, it is to be hoped that they will improve the circumstance
to the honour and glory of the Author of
all our mercies, and with gratitude to the instrument
who may be raised up for their good.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Memorandum-books
and Almanacks.</span></h3>

<p>The memorandum-books in demand in street-sale
are used for weekly “rent-books.” The
payment of the rent is entered by the landlord,
and the production of one of these books, showing
a punctuality of payment, perhaps for years,
is one of the best “references” that can be
given by any one in search of a new lodging.
They are bought also for the entrance of orders,
and then of prices, in the trade at chandler’s
shops, &amp;c., where weekly or monthly accounts
are run. All, or nearly all, the street-stationers
sell memorandum-books, and in addition
to them, there may be, I am told, sometimes as
many as fifty poor persons, including women
and children, who sell memorandum-books with
other trifling articles, not necessarily stationery,
but such things as stay-laces or tapes. If a
man sell memorandum-books alone it is because
his means limit him to that stock, he being at
the time, what I heard a patterer describe as, a
“dry-bread cove.” The price is 6<i>d.</i> the dozen,
or 9<i>d.</i> (with almanacks pasted inside the cover),
and thirteen to the dozen. No more than 1<i>d.</i>
is obtained in the streets for any kind of memorandum-books.</p>

<p>The almanack street trade, I heard on all
hands, had become a mere nothing. “What
else can you expect, sir,” said one street-seller,
“when so many publicans sends almanacks
round, or gives them away to their customers;
and when the slop tailors’ shilling-a-day men
thrust one into people’s hands at every corner?
It was a capital trade once, before the duty was
taken off&mdash;capital! The duty wasn’t in our way
so much as in the shop-keepers’, though <i>they</i>
did a good deal on the sly in unstamped almanacks.
Why of a night in October I’ve many
a time cleared 5<i>s.</i> and more by selling in the
public-houses almanacks at 2<i>d.</i> and 3<i>d.</i> a-piece
(they cost me 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a dozen at that
time). Anything that way, when Government’s
done, has a ready sale; people enjoys it; and
I suppose no man, as ever was, thinks it
much harm to do a tax-gatherer! I don’t pay
the income-tax myself (laughing). One evening
I sold, just by Blackfriars-bridge, fourteen
dozen of diamond almanacks to fit into hat-crowns.
I was liable, in course, and ran a
risk. I sold them mostly at 1<i>d.</i> a piece, but
sometimes got 6<i>d.</i> for three. I cleared between
6<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> The ‘diamonds’ cost me 8<i>d.</i> a
dozen.”</p>

<p>The street almanack trade is now carried on
by the same parties as I have specified in my
account of memorandum-books. Those sold
are of any cheap kind, costing wholesale 6<i>d.</i> a
dozen, but they are almost always announced
as “Moore’s.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Pocket-books
and Diaries.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of pocket-books, in the streets, is not,
I was told by several persons, “a living for a
man now-a-days.” Ten years ago it was common
to find men in the streets offering “half-crown
pocket-books” for 1<i>s.</i>, and holding them
open so as to display the engravings, if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
were any. The street-sale usually takes place
in March, when the demand for the regular
trade has ceased, and the publishers dispose of
their unsold stock. The trade is now, I am
assured, only about a tenth of its former extent.
The reason assigned for the decline is that
almanacks, diaries, &amp;c., are so cheap that people
look upon 1<i>s.</i> as an enormous price, even for a
“beautiful morocco-bound pocket-book,” as the
street-seller proclaims it. The binding is roan
(a dressed sheep-skin, morocco being a goat-skin),
an imitation of morocco, but the pocket-books
are really those which in the October
preceding have been published in the regular
way of trade. Some few of them may, however,
have been damaged, and these are bought
by the street-people as a “job lot,” and at a
lower price than that paid in the regular way;
which is 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, thirteen to
the dozen. The “job lot” is sometimes bought
for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a dozen, and sold at 6<i>d.</i> each, or as low
as 4<i>d.</i>,&mdash;for street-sellers generally bewail their
having often to come down to “fourpenny-bits,
as they’re going so much now.” One man told
me that he was four days last March in selling
a dozen pocket-books, though the weather was
not unfavourable, and that his profit was 5<i>s.</i>
Engravings of the “fashions,” the same man
told me, were “no go now.” Even poorly-dressed
women (but they might, he thought, be
dress-makers) had said to him the last time he
displayed a pocket-book with fashions&mdash;“They’re
out now.” The principal supplier of pocket-books,
&amp;c., to the street-trade is in Bride-lane,
Fleet-street. Commercial diaries are bought and
sold at the same rate as pocket-books; but the
sale becomes smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>I am informed that “last season” there were
twenty men, all street-traders in “paper,” or
“anything that was up,” at other times, selling
pocket-books and diaries. For this trade Leicester-square
is a favourite place. Calculating,
from the best data I can command, that each of
those men took 15<i>s.</i> weekly for a month (half of
it their profit), we find 60<i>l.</i> expended in the
streets in this purchase. Ledgers are sometimes
sold in the streets; but as the sale is more
a hawker’s than a regular street-seller’s, an account
of the traffic is not required by my present
subject.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Songs.</span></h3>

<p>These street-traffickers, with the exception, in
a great degree, of the “pinners-up,” are of the
same class, but their callings are diversified.
There are long song-sellers, ballad-sellers (who
are generally singers of the ballads they vend,
unless they are old and infirm, and offer ballads
instead of begging), chaunters, pinners-up, and
song-book-sellers. The three first-mentioned
classes I have already described in their connection
with the patterers; and I now proceed to
deal with the two last-mentioned.</p>

<p>The “pinners-up” (whom I have mentioned
as an exceptional body), are the men and women&mdash;the
women being nearly a third of the number
of the men&mdash;who sell songs which they have
“pinned” to a sort of screen or large board, or
have attached them, in any convenient way, to
a blank wall; and they differ from the other
song-sellers, inasmuch as that they are not at
all connected with patter, and have generally
been mechanics, porters, or servants, and reduced
to struggle for a living as “pinners-up.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street “Pinners-up,” or Wall
Song-sellers.</span></h3>

<p>These street-traders, when I gave an account
of them in the winter of 1849, were not 50 in
number; they are now, I learn, about 30. One
informant counted 28, and thought “that was
nearly all.”</p>

<p>I have, in my account of street song-sellers,
described the character of the class of pinners-up.
Among the best-accustomed stands are
those in Tottenham-court Road, the New-road,
the City-road, near the Vinegar-works, the
Westminster-road, and in Shoreditch, near the
Eastern Counties Station. One of the best-known
of the pinners-up was a stout old man,
wearing a great-coat in all weathers, who
“pinned-up” in an alley leading from Whitefriars-street
to the Temple, but now thrown into
an open street. He had old books for sale on a
stall, in addition to his ballads, and every morning
was seen reading the newspaper, borrowed
from a neighbouring public-house which he
“used,” for he was a keen politician. “He
would quarrel with any one,” said a person who
then resided in the neighbourhood&mdash;an account
confirmed to me at the public-house in question&mdash;“mostly
about politics, or about the books
and songs he sold. Why, sir, I’ve talked to
him many a time, and have stood looking
through his books; and if a person came up
and said, ‘Oh, Burn’s Works, 1<i>s.</i>; I can’t
understand him,’&mdash;then the old boy would
abuse him for a fool! Suppose another came
and said&mdash;for I’ve noticed it myself&mdash;‘Ah!
Burns&mdash;he was a poet!’ that didn’t pass; for
the jolly old pinner-up would say, ‘Well, now,
I don’t know about that.’ In my opinion, he
cared nothing about this side or that&mdash;this
notion or the opposite&mdash;but he liked to <i>shine</i>.”
The old man was carried off in the prevalence
of the cholera in 1849.</p>

<p>At the period I have specified, I received the
following statement from a man who at that
time pinned-up by Harewood-place, Oxford-street:</p>

<p>“I’m forty-nine,” he said. “I’ve no children,
thank God, but a daughter, who is eighteen,
and no incumbrance to me, as she is in a ‘house
of business;’ and as she has been there nine years,
her character can’t be so very bad. (This was
said proudly.) I worked twenty-two years with
a great sculptor as a marble polisher, and besides
that, I used to run errands for him, and was a
sort of porter, like, to him. I couldn’t get any
work, because he hadn’t no more marble-work to
do; so nine or ten years back I went into this line.
I knew a man what done well in it&mdash;but times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was better then&mdash;and that put it into my head.
It cost me 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to stock my stall, and get
all together comfortable; for I started with old
books as well as songs. I got leave to stand
here from the landlord. I sell ballads and manuscript
music (beautifully done these music
sheets were), which is ‘transposed’ (so he
worded it) from the nigger songs. There’s two
does them for me. They’re transposed for the
violin. One that does them is a musicianer,
who plays outside public-houses, but I think
his daughter does most of it. I sell my songs
at a halfpenny,&mdash;and, when I can get it, a penny
a piece. Do I yarn a pound a week? Lor’
bless you, no. Nor 15<i>s.</i>, nor 12<i>s.</i> I don’t yarn,
one week with another, not 10<i>s.</i>, sometimes not
5<i>s.</i> My wife don’t yarn nothing. She used to
go out charing, but she can’t now. I am at
my stall at nine in the morning, and sometimes
I have walked five or six miles to buy my
‘pubs’ before that. I stop till ten at night oft
enough. The wet days is the ruin of us; and
I think wet days increases. [This was said on
a rainy day.] Such a day as yesterday now I
didn’t take, not make,&mdash;but I didn’t <i>take</i> what
would pay for a pint of beer and a bit of bread
and cheese. My rent’s 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a week for one
room, and I’ve got my own bits of sticks there.
I’ve always kept <i>them</i>, thank God!”</p>

<p>Generally, these dealers know little of the
songs they sell,&mdash;taking the printer’s word, when
they purchase, as to “what was going.” The
most popular comic songs (among this class I
heard the word <i>song</i> used far more frequently
than <i>ballad</i>) are not sold so abundantly as
others,&mdash;because, I was told, boys soon picked
<i>them</i> up by heart, hearing them so often, and
so did not buy them. Neither was there a
great demand for nigger songs, nor for “flash
ditties,” but for such productions as “A Life
on the Ocean Wave,” “I’m Afloat,” “There’s
a Good Time coming,” “Farewell to the
Mountain,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Three-fourths of the customers
of these traders, one man assured me,
were boys.</p>

<p>Indecent songs are not sold by the pinners-up.
One man of whom I made inquiries was
quite indignant that I should even think it
necessary to ask such questions. The “songs”
cost the pinners-up, generally, 2<i>d.</i> a dozen,
sometimes 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and sometimes less than 2<i>d.</i>,
according to the quality of the paper and the
demand.</p>

<p>On fine summer days the wall song-sellers
take 2<i>s.</i> on an average. On short wintry days
they may not take half so much, and on very
foggy or rainy days they take nothing at all.
Their ballads are of the same sort as those I
proceed to describe under especial heads, and
I have shown what are of readiest sale. Reckoning
that each pinner-up, thirty in number,
now takes 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly (7<i>s.</i> being the profit),
we find that 780 guineas are yearly expended
in London streets, in the ballads of the
pinners-up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Ancient and Modern Street Ballad
Minstrelsy.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes of
the People of England,” shows, as do other
authorities, that in the reigns subsequent to the
Norman Conquest the minstrels “were permitted
to perform in the rich monasteries, and
in the mansions of the nobility, which they
frequently visited in large parties, and especially
upon occasions of festivity. They entered
the castles without the least ceremony, rarely
waiting for any previous invitation, and there
exhibited their performances for the entertainment
of the lord of the mansion and his guests.
They were, it seems, admitted without any
difficulty, and handsomely rewarded for the
exertion of their talents.”</p>

<p>Of the truth of this statement all contemporary
history is a corroboration. The minstrels
then, indeed, constituted the theatre, the opera,
and the concert of the powerful and wealthy.
They were decried by some of the clergy of
that day,&mdash;as are popular performers and opera
singers (occasionally) by some zealous divine
in our own era. John of Salisbury stigmatizes
minstrels as “ministers of the devil.”</p>

<p>“The large gratuities collected by these
artists,” the same antiquarian writer further
says, “not only occasioned great numbers to
join their fraternity, but also induced many
idle and dissipated persons to assume the
characters of minstrels, to the disgrace of the
profession. These evils became at last so notorious,
that in the reign of King Edward II. it
was thought necessary to restrain them by a
public edict, which sufficiently explains the
nature of the grievance. It states, that many
indolent persons, under the colour of minstrelsy,
intruded themselves into the residences of the
wealthy, where they had both meat and drink,
but were not contented without the addition of
large gifts from the householder. To restrain
this abuse, the mandate ordains, that no person
should resort to the houses of prelates, earls,
or barons, to eat, or to drink, who was not a
professed minstrel; nor more than three or
four minstrels of honour at most in one day
(meaning, I presume, the king’s minstrels of
honour and those retained by the nobility),
except they came by invitation from the lord
of the house.”</p>

<p>The themes of the minstrels were the triumphs,
victories, pageants, and great events of the day;
commingled with the praise, or the satire of
individuals, as the humour of the patron or of
the audience might be gratified. It is stated
that Longchamp, the favourite and justiciary
of Richard Cœur-de-lion, not only engaged
poets to make songs and poems in his, Bishop
Longchamp’s, praise, but the best singers and
minstrels to sing them in the public streets!</p>

<p>In the ninth year of the reign of Edward IV.
another royal edict was issued, as little favourable
to the minstrels as the one I have given
an account of; and those functionaries seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
have gradually fallen in the estimation of the
public, and to have been contemned by the
law, down to the statute of Elizabeth, already
alluded to, subjecting them to the same treatment
as rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars.
A writer of the period (1589) represents the
(still-styled) minstrels, singing “ballads and
small popular musickes” for the amusement
of boys and others “that passe by them in the
streete.” It is related also that their “matters
were for the most part stories of old time; as the
tale of Sir Topas, Bevis of Southampton, Guy
of Warwick, Adam Bell, and Clymme of the
Clough, and such other old romances or historical
rhymes, made purposely for the recreation
of the common people at Christmas dinners and
bride ales, and in tavernes and alehouses, and
such other places of base resort.”</p>

<p>These “stories of old time” are now valuable
as affording illustrations of ancient manners,
and have been not unfertile as subjects of antiquarian
annotation.</p>

<p>Under the head of the “Norman Minstrels,”
Mr. Strutt says: “It is very certain that the
poet, the songster, and the musician were
frequently united in the same person.”</p>

<p>From this historical sketch it appears evident
that the ballad-singer and seller of to-day is the
sole descendant, or remains, of the minstrel of
old, as regards the business of the streets;
he is, indeed, the minstrel having lost caste, and
being driven to play cheap.</p>

<p>The themes of the minstrels were wars, and
victories, and revolutions; so of the modern
man of street ballads. If the minstrel celebrated
with harp and voice the unhorsings, the
broken bones, the deaths, the dust, the blood,
and all the glory and circumstance of a tournament,&mdash;so
does the ballad-seller, with voice
and fiddle, glorify the feelings, the broken bones,
the blood, the deaths, and all the glory and
circumstance of a prize-fight. The minstrel
did not scoff at the madness which prevailed in
the lists, nor does the ballad-singer at the
brutality which rules in the ring. The minstrels
had their dirges for departed greatness; the
ballad-singer, like old Allan Bane, also “pours
his wailing o’er the dead”&mdash;for are there not the
street “helegies” on all departed greatness? In
the bestowal of flattery or even of praise the
modern minstrel is far less liberal than was his
prototype; but the laudation was, in the good old
times, very often “paid for” by the person whom
it was sung to honour. Were the same measure
applied to the ballad-singer and writer of to-day,
there can be no reason to doubt that it
would be attended with the same result. In his
satire the modern has somewhat of an advantage
over his predecessor. The minstrel not rarely
received a “largesse” to satirize some one
obnoxious to a rival, or to a disappointed man.
The ballad-singer (or chaunter, for these remarks
apply with equal force to both of these
street-professionals), is seldom hired to abuse.
I was told, indeed, by a clever chaunter, that he
had been sent lately by a strange gentleman to
sing a song&mdash;which he and his mate (a patterer)
happened at the time to be working&mdash;in front
of a neighbouring house. The song was on the
rogueries of the turf; and the “move” had
a doubly advantageous effect. “One gentleman,
you see, sir, gave us 1<i>s.</i> to go and sing;
and afore we’d well finished the chorus, somebody
sent us from the house another 1<i>s.</i> to go
away agin.” I believe this to be the only
way in which the satire of a ballad-singer is
rewarded, otherwise than by sale to his usual
class of customers in the streets or the public-houses.
The ancient professors of street minstrelsy
unquestionably played and sung satirical
lays, depending for their remuneration on the
liberality of their out-of-door audience; so is
it precisely with the modern. The minstrel
played both singly and with his fellows; the
ballad-singer “works” both alone (but not
frequently) and with his “mates” or his
“school.”</p>

<p>In the persons of some of these modern street
professionals, as I have shown and shall further
show, are united the functions of “the
poet, the songster, and the musician.” So in
the days of yore. There are now female ballad-singers;
there were female minstrels, or glee-women.
The lays which were poured forth in
our streets and taverns some centuries back,
either for the regalement of a miscellaneous
assemblage, or of a select few, were sometimes
of an immoral tendency. Such, it cannot be
denied, is the case in our more enlightened days
at our Cyder-cellars, Coal-holes, Penny Gaffs,
and such like places. Rarely, however, are
such things sung in the streets of London; but
sometimes at country fairs and races.</p>

<p>In one respect the analogy between the two
ages of these promoters of street enjoyment does
not hold. The minstrel’s garb was distinctive.
It was not always the short laced tunic, tight
trousers, and russet boots, with a well plumed
cap,&mdash;which seems to be the modern notion of
this tuneful itinerant. The king’s and queen’s
minstrels wore the royal livery, but so altered
as to have removed from its appearance what
might seem menial. The minstrels of the
great barons also assumed their patron’s liveries,
with the like qualification. A minstrel of
the highest class might wear “a fayre gowne
of cloth of gold,” or a military dress, or a
“tawnie coat,” or a foreign costume, or even
an ecclesiastical garb,&mdash;and some of them went
so far as to shave their crowns, the better to
resemble monks. Of course they were imitated
by their inferiors. The minstrel, then, wore a
particular dress; the ballad-singer of the present
day wears no particular dress. During the
terrors of the reign of Henry VIII., and after
the Reformation, a large body of the minstrels
fell into meanness of attire; and in that respect
the modern ballad-singer <i>is</i> analogous.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that I have all
along spoken&mdash;except when the description is
necessarily general&mdash;of the <i>street</i>, or itinerant,
minstrel of old. The highest professors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
art were poets and composers, men often of
genius, learning, and gravity, and were no more
to be ranked with the mass of those I have been
describing than is Alfred Tennyson with any
Smithfield scribbler and bawler of some Newgate
“Copy of Verses.”</p>

<p>How long “Sir Topas” and the other “old
stories” continued to be sung in the streets
there are no means of ascertaining. But there
are old songs, as I ascertained from an intelligent
and experienced street-singer, still occasionally
heard in the open air, but more in the
country than the metropolis. Among those still
heard, however rarely, are the Earl of Dorset’s
song, written on the night before a naval engagement
with the Dutch, in 1665:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“To all you ladies now on land,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">We men at sea indite.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I give the titles of the others, not chronologically,
but as they occurred to my informant’s
recollection&mdash;“A Cobbler there was, and he
liv’d in a Stall”&mdash;Parnell’s song of “My Days
have been so wond’rous Free,” now sung in the
streets to the tune of “Gramachree.” A song
(of which I could not procure a copy, but my
informant had lately heard it in the street) about
the Cock-lane <span class="lock">Ghost&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Now ponder well, you parents dear</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The words which I shall write;</div>
       <div class="verse">A doleful story you shall hear,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">In time brought forth to light.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the “Children in the Wood” and “Chevy-chase.”
Concerning this old ditty one man said
to me: “Yes, sir, I’ve sung it at odd times and
not long ago in the north of England, and I’ve
been asked whereabouts Chevy-chase lay, but
I never learned.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“In Scarlet towne, where I was borne,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">There was a faire maid dwellin’,</div>
       <div class="verse">Made every youth crye, Well-awaye!</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Her name was Barbara Allen.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Barbara Allen’s selling yet,” I was told.
“Gilderoy was a Bonnie Boy,” is another song
yet sung occasionally in the streets.</p>

<p>“The ballad,” says a writer on the subject,
“may be considered as the native species of
poetry of this country. It very exactly answers
the idea formerly given of original poetry, being
the rude uncultivated verse in which the popular
tale of the time was recorded. As our
ancestors partook of the fierce warlike character
of the northern nations, the subjects of their
poetry would chiefly consist of the martial exploits
of their heroes, and the military events of
national history, deeply tinctured with that passion
for the marvellous, and that superstitious
credulity, which always attend a state of ignorance
and barbarism. Many of the ancient
ballads have been transmitted to the present
times, and in them the character of the nation
displays itself in striking colours.”</p>

<p>The “Ballads on a Subject,” of which I shall
proceed to treat, are certainly “the rude uncultivated
verse in which the popular tale of the
times is recorded,” and what may be the character
of the nation as displayed in them I leave
to the reader’s judgment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Street “Ballads on a Subject.”</span></h3>

<p>There is a class of ballads which may with
perfect propriety be called <i>street</i> ballads, as
they are written by street authors for street
singing (or chaunting) and street sale. These
effusions, however, are known in the trade by
a title appropriate enough&mdash;“Ballads on a
Subject.” The most successful workers in this
branch of the profession, are the men I have
already described among the patterers and
chaunters.</p>

<p>The “Ballads on a Subject” are always on
a political, criminal, or exciting public event,
or one that has interested the public, and the
celerity with which one of them is written, and
then sung in the streets, is in the spirit of
“these railroad times.” After any great event,
“a ballad on the subject” is often enough
written, printed, and sung in the street, in little
more than an hour. Such was the case with
a song “in honour,” it was announced, “of
Lord John Russell’s resignation.” Of course
there is no time for either the correction of the
rhymes or of the press; but this is regarded as
of little consequence&mdash;while an early “start”
with a new topic is of great consequence, I am
assured; “yes, indeed, both for the sake of
meals and rents.” If, however, the songs were
ever so carefully revised, their sale would not
be greater.</p>

<p>I need not treat this branch of our street
literature at any great length, as specimens of
the “Ballad on a Subject” will be found in
many of the preceding statements of paper-workers.</p>

<p>It will have struck the reader that all the
street lays quoted as popular have a sort of
burthen or jingle at the end of each verse. I
was corrected, however, by a street chaunter for
speaking of this burthen as a jingle. “It’s a
chorus, sir,” he said. “In a proper ballad on
a subject, there’s often twelve verses, none of
them under eight lines,&mdash;and there’s a four-line
chorus to every verse; and, if it’s the
right sort, it’ll sell the ballad.” I was told, on
all hands, that it was not the words that ever
“made a ballad, but the subject; and, more than
the subject,&mdash;the chorus; and, far more than
either,&mdash;<i>the tune</i>!” Indeed, many of the street-singers
of ballads on a subject have as supreme
a contempt for words as can be felt by any modern
composer. To select a tune for a ballad,
however, is a matter of deep deliberation. To
adapt the ballad to a tune too common or popular
is injudicious; for then, I was told, any one
can sing it&mdash;boys and all. To select a more
elaborate and less-known air, however appropriate,
may not be pleasing to some of the
members of “the school” of ballad-singers, who
may feel it to be beyond their vocal powers;
neither may it be relished by the critical in
street song, whose approving criticism induces
them to purchase as well as to admire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The license enjoyed by the court jesters, and,
in some respects, by the minstrels of old, is certainly
enjoyed, undiminished, by the street-writers
and singers of ballads on a subject.
They are unsparing satirists, who, with a rare
impartiality, lash all classes and all creeds, as
well as any individual. One man, upon whose
information I can rely, told me that, eleven
years ago, he himself had “worked,” in town
and country, 23 different songs at the same
period and on the same subject&mdash;the marriage
of the Queen. They all “sold,”&mdash;but the most
profitable was one “as sung by Prince Albert in
character.” It was to the air of the “Dusty
Miller;” and “it was good,” said the ballad-man,
“because we could easily dress up to the
character given to Albert.” I quote a verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Here I am in rags</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">From the land of All-dirt,</div>
       <div class="verse">To marry England’s Queen,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And my name it is Prince Albert.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“And what’s more, sir,” continued my informant,
“not very long after the honeymoon, the
Duchess of L&mdash;&mdash; drove up in her carriage
to the printer’s, and bought all the songs in
honour of Victoria’s wedding, and gave a sovereign
for them and wouldn’t take the change.
It was a duchess. Why I’m sure about it&mdash;though
I can’t say whether it were the Duchess
of L&mdash;&mdash; or S&mdash;&mdash;; for didn’t the printer, like
an honest man, when he’d stopped the price of
the papers, hand over to us chaps the balance to
drink, and <i>didn’t</i> we drink it! There can’t be
a mistake about <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>Of street ballads on political subjects, or
upon themes which have interested the whole
general public, I need not cite additional instances.
There are, however, other subjects,
which, though not regarded as of great interest
by the whole body of the people are still eventful
among certain classes, and for them the
street author and ballad-singer cater.</p>

<p>I first give a specimen of a ballad on a Theatrical
Subject. The best I find, in a large
collection of these street effusions, is entitled
“Jenny Lind and Poet B.” After describing
how Mr. Bunn “flew to Sweden” and engaged
Miss Lind, the poet proceeds,&mdash;the tune being
“Lucy Long”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“After Jenny sign’d the paper,</div>
       <div class="verse">She repented what she’d done,</div>
       <div class="verse">And said she must have been a cake,</div>
       <div class="verse">To be tempted by A. Bunn.</div>
       <div class="verse">The English tongue she must decline,</div>
       <div class="verse">It was such awkward stuff,</div>
       <div class="verse">And we find ’mongst our darling dames,</div>
       <div class="verse">That one tongue’s quite enough.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="center">CHORUS.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent4">So take your time Miss Jenny,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">Oh, take your time Miss Lind,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">You’re only to raise your voice,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">John Bull, will raise the wind.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Says Alfred in the public eye,</div>
       <div class="verse">My name you shan’t degrade,</div>
       <div class="verse">So birds that can and won’t sing</div>
       <div class="verse">Why in course they must be made</div>
       <div class="verse">This put Miss Jenny’s pipe out,</div>
       <div class="verse">Says Bunn your tricks I see,</div>
       <div class="verse">Altho’ you are a Nightingale,</div>
       <div class="verse">You shan’t play larks with me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">The Poet said he’d seek the law,</div>
       <div class="verse">No chance away he’d throw;</div>
       <div class="verse">Says Jenny if you think I’ll come,</div>
       <div class="verse">You’ll find it is no go!</div>
       <div class="verse">When a bird-catcher named ‘Lummy’</div>
       <div class="verse">With independence big,</div>
       <div class="verse">Pounced down upon the Nightingale,</div>
       <div class="verse">And with her hopp’d the twig!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I am inclined to think&mdash;though I know it to
be an unusual case&mdash;that in this theatrical ballad
the street poet was what is tenderly called a
“plagiarist.” I was assured by a chaunter that
it was written by a street author,&mdash;but probably
the chaunter was himself in error or forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Next, there is the Ballad on a Civic Subject.
In the old times the Lord Mayor had his
laureate. This writer, known as “poet to the
City of London,” eulogised all lord mayors, and
glorified all civic pageants. That of the 9th
November, especially, “lived in Settle’s numbers,
one day more,”&mdash;but Elkanah Settle was
the last of such scribes. After his death, the
city eschewed a poet. The office has now descended
to the street bard, who annually celebrates
the great ceremony. I cite two stanzas
and the chorus from the latest of these civic
Odes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Now Farncombe’s out and Musgrove’s in,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And grand is his position,</div>
       <div class="verse">Because he will be made a king,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">At the Hyde Park Exhibition;</div>
       <div class="verse">A feast he’ll order at Guildhall,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">For hypocrites and sinners,</div>
       <div class="verse">And he has sent Jack Forester to Rome,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To invite the Pope to dinner!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">A day like this we never saw,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The truth I am confessing,</div>
       <div class="verse">Batty’s astonishing menagerie,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Is in the great procession;</div>
       <div class="verse">There’s lions, tigers, bears and wolves,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To please each smiling feature,</div>
       <div class="verse">And elephants in harness drawing</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Drury Lane Theatre!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="center">CHORUS.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent2">“It is not as it used to be,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">Cut on so gay and thrifty,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The funny Lord Mayor’s Show to see,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">In eighteen hundred and fifty.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is, beside the descriptions of ballads
above cited, the Ballad Local. One of these is
headed the “Queer Doings in Leather-lane,”
and is on a subject concerning which street-sellers
generally express themselves strongly&mdash;Sunday
trading. The endeavour to stop street
trading (generally) in Leather-lane, with its
injurious results to the shopkeepers, has been
already mentioned. The ballad on this local
subject presents a personality now, happily, almost
confined to the street writers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“A rummy saintly lot is there,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">A domineering crew,</div>
       <div class="verse">A Butcher, and a Baker,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And an Undertaker too,</div>
       <div class="verse">Besides a cove who deals in wood,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And makes his bundles small,</div>
       <div class="verse">And looks as black on Sunday</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">As the Undertaker’s pall.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="center">CHORUS.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">You must not buy, you must not sell,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Oh! is it not a shame?</div>
       <div class="verse">It is a shocking place to dwell,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">About sweet Leather Lane.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">The Butcher does not like to hear</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">His neighbours holloa, buy!</div>
       <div class="verse">Although he on the Sunday</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Sells a little on the sly;</div>
       <div class="verse">And the Coffin Maker struts along</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Just like the great Lord Mayor,</div>
       <div class="verse">To bury folks on Sundays,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Instead of going to prayers.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are yet three themes of these street
songs, of which, though they have been alluded
to, no specimens have been given. I now supply
them. The first is the election ballad. I quote
two stanzas from “Middlesex and Victory! or,
Grosvenor and Osborne for ever!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Now Osborne is the man</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To struggle for your rights,</div>
       <div class="verse">He will vote against the Bishops,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">You know, both day and night,</div>
       <div class="verse">He will strive to crush the Poor Law Bill,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And that with all his might,</div>
       <div class="verse">And he will never give his vote</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To part a man from his wife.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="center">CHORUS.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Then cheer Osborne and Lord Grosvenor,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Cheer them with three times three,</div>
       <div class="verse">For they beat the soldier, Tommy Wood,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And gained the victory.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent2">I have not forgot Lord Grosvenor,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">Who nobly stood the test,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">For the electors of great Middlesex</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">I know he’ll do his best;</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">He will pull old Nosey o’er the coals,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">And lay him on his back,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And he swears that little Bob’s head</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">He will shove into a rat trap.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then come the “elegies.” Of three of these
I cite the opening stanza. That on the “Death
of Queen Adelaide” has for an illustration a
figure of Britannia leaning on her shield, with
the “Muse of History,” (as I presume from her
attributes,) at Britannia’s feet. In the distance
is the setting sun:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Old England may weep, her bright hopes are fled,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The friend of the poor is no more;</div>
       <div class="verse">For Adelaide now is numbered with the dead,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And her loss we shall sadly deplore.</div>
       <div class="verse">For though noble her birth, and high was her station</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The poor of this nation will miss her,</div>
       <div class="verse">For their wants she relieved without ostentation,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">But now she is gone, God bless her!</div>
       <div class="verse indent6">God bless her! God bless her!</div>
       <div class="verse indent6">But now she is gone, God bless her!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The elegy on the “Death of the Right Honourable
Sir Robert Peel, Bart. M.P.,” is set
off with a very fair portrait of that statesman.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Britannia! Britannia! what makes thee complain,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">O why so in sorrow relenting,</div>
       <div class="verse">Old England is lost, we are borne down in pain,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And the nation in grief is lamenting,</div>
       <div class="verse">That excellent man&mdash;the pride of the land,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Whom every virtue possessed him,</div>
       <div class="verse">Is gone to that Home, from whence no one returns,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Our dear friend, Sir Robert, God rest him.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The verses which bewail the “Death of
H. R. H. the Duke of Cambridge,” and which
are adorned with the same illustration as those
upon Queen Adelaide, begin</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Oh! death, thou art severe, and never seems contented,</div>
       <div class="verse">Prince Adolphus Frederick is summoned away,</div>
       <div class="verse">The death of Royal Cambridge in sorrow lamented,</div>
       <div class="verse">Like the good Sir Robert Peel, he no longer could stay;</div>
       <div class="verse">His virtues were good, and noble was his actions,</div>
       <div class="verse">His presence at all places caused much attraction,</div>
       <div class="verse">Britannia for her loss is driven to distraction,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Royal Cambridge, we’ll behold thee no more!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The third class of street-ballads relates to
“fires.” The one I quote, “On the Awful Fire
at B. Caunt’s, in St. Martin’s-lane,” is preceded
by an engraving of a lady and a cavalier, the
lady pointing to a column surmounted by an
urn. I again give the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“I will unfold a tale of sorrow,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">List, you tender parents dear,</div>
       <div class="verse">It will thrill each breast with horror,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">When the dreadful tale you hear.</div>
       <div class="verse">Early on last Wednesday morning,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">A raging fire as we may see,</div>
       <div class="verse">Did occur, most sad and awful,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Between the hours of two and three.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In a subsequent stanza are four lines, not without
some rough pathos, and adapted to move
the feelings of a street audience. The writer is
alluding to the grief of the parents who had lost
two children by a terrible death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“No more their smiles they’ll be beholding,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">No more their pretty faces see,</div>
       <div class="verse">No more to their bosoms will they fold them,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Oh! what must their feelings be.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I find no difference in style between the ballads
on a subject of to-day, and the oldest which
I could obtain a sight of, which were sung in
the present generation&mdash;except that these poems
now begin far less frequently with what at one
time was as common as an invocation to the
Muse&mdash;the invitation to good Christians to attend
to the singer. One on the Sloanes, however,
opens in the old fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Come all good Christians and give attention,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Unto these lines I will unfold,</div>
       <div class="verse">With heartfelt feelings to you I’ll mention,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">I’m sure ’twill make your blood run cold.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I now conclude this account of street-ballads
on a subject with two verses from one on
the subject of “The Glorious Fight for the
Championship of England.” The celebration
of these once-popular encounters is, as I have
already stated, one of the points in which the
modern ballad-man emulates his ancient brother
minstrel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“On the ninth day of September,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Eighteen hundred and forty five,</div>
       <div class="verse">From London down to Nottingham</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">The roads were all alive;</div>
       <div class="verse">Oh! such a sight was never seen,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Believe me it is so,</div>
       <div class="verse">Tens of thousands went to see the fight,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">With Caunt and Bendigo.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">And near to Newport Pagnell,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Those men did strip so fine,</div>
       <div class="verse">Ben Caunt stood six feet two and a half,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And Bendigo five foot nine;</div>
       <div class="verse">Ben Caunt, a giant did appear,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And made the claret flow,</div>
       <div class="verse">And he seemed fully determined</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Soon to conquer Bendigo.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="center">CHORUS.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent2">With their hit away and slash away,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">So manfully you see,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Ben Caunt has lost and Bendigo</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">Has gained the victory.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Poets and Authors.</span></h3>

<p><i>Authorship</i>, for street sale, is chiefly confined
to the production of verse, which, whatever be
its nature, is known through the trade as
“ballads.” Two distinctions, indeed, are recognised&mdash;“Ballads”
and “Ballads on a Subject.”
The last-mentioned is, as I have said and
shown, the publication which relates to any
specific event; national or local, criminal or
merely extraordinary, true or false. Under the
head “Ballads,” the street-sellers class all that
does not come under the description of “Ballads
on a Subject.”</p>

<p>The same street authors&mdash;now six in number&mdash;compose
indiscriminately any description of ballad,
including the copy of verses I have shown to
be required as a necessary part of all histories
or trials of criminals. When the printer has determined
upon a “Sorrowful Lamentation,” he
sends to a poet for a copy of verses, which is
promptly supplied. The payment I have already
mentioned&mdash;1<i>s.</i>; but sometimes, if the
printer (and publisher) like the verses, he
“throws a penny or two over;” and sometimes
also, in case of a great sale, there is the same
over-sum.</p>

<p>Fewer ballads, I was assured, than was the
case ten or twelve years ago, are now written
expressly for street sale or street minstrelsy.
“They come to the printer, for nothing, from
the concert-room. He has only to buy a ‘Ross’
or a ‘Sharp’” [song-books] “for 1<i>d.</i>, and there’s
a lot of ’em; so, in course, a publisher ain’t
a-going to give a bob, if he can be served for a
farthing, just by buying a song-book.”</p>

<p>Another man, himself not a “regular poet,”
but a little concerned in street productions, said
to me, with great earnestness: “Now look at
this, sir, and I hope you’ll just say, sir, as I tell
you. You’ve given the public a deal of information
about men like me, and some of our chaps
abuses you for it like mad; but I say it’s all
right, for it’s all true. Now you’ll have learned,
sir, or, any way, you will learn, that there’s
songs sung in the streets, and sometimes in some
tap-rooms, that isn’t decent, and relates to
nothing but wickedness. There wasn’t a few of
those songs once written for the streets, straight
away, and a great sale they had, I know&mdash;but far
better at country fairs and races than in town.
Since the singing-houses&mdash;I don’t mean where
you pay to go to a concert, no! but such as your
Cyder-cellars, and your night-houses, where
there’s lords, and gentlemen, and city swells,
and young men up from the colleges&mdash;since
these places has been up so flourishing, there
hasn’t, I do believe, been <i>one</i> such song written
by one of our poets. They all come from the
places where the lords, and genelmen, and collegians
is capital customers; and they never was
a worse sort of ballads than now. In course those
houses is licensed, and perticler respectable, or
it wouldn’t be allowed; and if I was to go to
the foot of the bridge, sir (Westminster-bridge),
and chaunt any such songs, and my mate should
sell them, why we should very soon be taking
reg’lar exercise on Colonel Chesterton’s everlasting
staircase. We has a great respect for
the law&mdash;O, certainly!”</p>

<p>Parodies on any very popular song, which
used to be prepared expressly for street trade,
are now, in like manner, derived from the night-house
or the concert-room; but not entirely so.
The parody “Cab, cab, cab!” which was heard
in almost every street, was originated in a concert-room.</p>

<p>The ballads which have lately been written,
and published expressly for the street sale, and
have proved the most successful, are parodies or
imitations of “The Gay Cavalier.” One street
ballad, commencing in the following words, was,
I am told, greatly admired, both in the streets
and the public-houses.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“’Twas a dark foggy night,</div>
       <div class="verse">And the moon gave no light,</div>

       <div class="verse">Dealt in ‘Donovan’s hot’</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Said he’d go to court his fair maid.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I now give three stanzas of “The Way to
Live Happy Together,”&mdash;a ballad said to have
been written expressly for street sale. Its popularity
is anything but discreditable to the street-buyers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>“It’s all as one, sir,” was the answer of a man
whom I questioned on the subject; “it’s the
same poet; and the same tip for any ballad.
No more nor a bob for nothing.”</p>

<p>A large number of ballads which I procured,
and all sold and sung in the street, though not
written expressly for the purpose, presented a
curious study enough. They were of every
class. I specify a few, to show the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the collection (not including ballads on a subject):
“Ye Banks and Braes o’ Bonnie Doun,”
with (on the same sheet) “The Merry Fiddler,”
(an indecent song)&mdash;“There’s a good
Time coming, Boys,” “Nix, my Dolly,” “The
Girls of &mdash;&mdash;shire,” (which of course is available
for any county)&mdash;“Widow Mahoney,”
“Remember the Glories of Brian the Brave,”
“Clementina Clemmins,” “Lucy Long,”
“Erin Go Bragh,” “Christmas in 1850,”
“The Death of Nelson,” “The Life and
Adventures of Jemmy Sweet,” “The Young
May Moon,” “Hail to the Tyrol,” “He was
sich a Lushy Cove,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>I may here mention&mdash;but a fuller notice may
be necessary when I treat of street art&mdash;that
some of these ballads have an “illustration”
always at the top of the column. “The Heart
that can Feel for Another” is illustrated by a
gaunt and savage-looking lion. “The Amorous
Waterman of St. John’s Wood,” presents a
very short, obese, and bow-legged grocer, in
top-boots, standing at his door, while a lady in
a huge bonnet is “taking a sight at him,” to
the evident satisfaction of a “baked ’tater” man.
“Rosin the Beau” is heralded by the rising
sun. “The Poachers” has a cut of the Royal
Exchange above the title. “The Miller’s
Ditty” is illustrated by a perfect dandy, of
the slimmest and straightest fashion; and
“When I was first Breeched,” by an engraving
of a Highlander. Many of the ballads, however
have engravings appropriate enough.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Street Author,
or Poet.</span></h3>

<p>I have already mentioned the present number
of street authors, as I most frequently heard
them styled, though they write only verses. I
called upon one on the recommendation of a
neighbouring tradesman, of whom I made some
inquiries. He could not tell me the number of
the house in the court where the man lived, but
said I had only to inquire for the Tinker, or
the Poet, and any one would tell me.</p>

<p>I found the poor poet, who bears a good character,
on a sick bed; he was suffering, and had
long been suffering, from abscesses. He was apparently
about forty-five, with the sunken eyes,
hollow cheeks, and, not pale but thick and rather
sallow complexion, which indicate ill-health and
scant food. He spoke quietly, and expressed
resignation. His room was not very small, and
was furnished in the way usual among the very
poor, but there were a few old pictures over the
mantel-piece. His eldest boy, a lad of thirteen
or fourteen, was making dog-chains; at which he
earned a shilling or two, sometimes 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, by
sale in the streets.</p>

<p>“I was born at Newcastle-under-Lyne,” the
man said, “but was brought to London when,
I believe, I was only three months old. I was
very fond of reading poems, in my youth, as
soon as I could read and understand almost.
Yes, very likely, sir; perhaps it was that put it
into my head to write them afterwards. I was
taught wire-working, and jobbing, and was
brought up to hawking wire-work in the streets,
and all over England and Wales. It was never
a very good trade&mdash;just a living. Many and
many a weary mile we’ve travelled together,&mdash;I
mean, my wife and I have: and we’ve sometimes
been benighted, and had to wander or rest
about until morning. It wasn’t that we hadn’t
money to pay for a lodging, but we couldn’t get
one. We lost count of the days sometimes in
wild parts; but if we did lose count, or thought
we had, I could always tell when it was Sunday
morning by the look of nature; there was a
mystery and a beauty about it as told me. I
was very fond of Goldsmith’s poetry always.
I can repeat ‘Edwin and Emma’ now. No, sir;
I never read the ‘Vicar of Wakefield.’ I found
‘Edwin and Emma’ in a book called the
‘Speaker.’ I often thought of it in travelling
through some parts of the country.</p>

<p>“Above fourteen years ago I tried to make a
shilling or two by selling my verses. I’d written
plenty before, but made nothing by them. Indeed
I never tried. The first song I ever sold
was to a concert-room manager. The next I
sold had great success. It was called the ‘Demon
of the Sea,’ and was to the tune of ‘The Brave
Old Oak.’ Do I remember how it began? Yes,
sir, I remember every word of it. It began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent4">Unfurl the sails,</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">We’ve easy gales;</div>
       <div class="verse">And helmsman steer aright.</div>
       <div class="verse">Hoist the grim death’s head&mdash;</div>
       <div class="verse indent4">The Pirate’s head&mdash;</div>
       <div class="verse">For a vessel heaves in sight!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That song was written for a concert-room, but
it was soon in the streets, and ran a whole winter.
I got only 1<i>s.</i> for it. Then I wrote the ‘Pirate
of the Isles,’ and other ballads of that sort. The
concert-rooms pay no better than the printers
for the streets.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the best thing I ever wrote was the
‘Husband’s Dream.’ I’m very sorry indeed
that I can’t offer you copies of some of my
ballads, but I haven’t a single copy myself of
any of them, not one, and I dare say I’ve
written a thousand in my time, and most of
them were printed. I believe 10,000 were sold
of the ‘Husband’s Dream.’ It begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">O Dermot, you look healthy now,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Your dress is neat and clean;</div>
       <div class="verse">I never see you drunk about,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Then tell me where you’ve been.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Your wife and family&mdash;are they well?</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">You once did use them strange:</div>
       <div class="verse">O, are you kinder to them grown,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">How came this happy change?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Then Dermot tells how he dreamed of his
wife’s sudden death, and his childrens’ misery as
they cried about her dead body, while he was
drunk in bed, and as he calls out in his misery,
he wakes, and finds his wife by his side. The
ballad ends:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘I pressed her to my throbbing heart,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Whilst joyous tears did stream;</div>
       <div class="verse">And ever since, I’ve heaven blest,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">For sending me that dream.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>“Dermot turned teetotaller. The teetotallers
were very much pleased with that song. The
printer once sent me 5<i>s.</i> on account of it.</p>

<p>“I have written all sorts of things&mdash;ballads
on a subject, and copies of verses, and anything
ordered of me, or on anything I thought
would be accepted, but now I can’t get about.
I’ve been asked to write indecent songs, but I
refused. One man offered me 5<i>s.</i> for six such
songs.&mdash;‘Why, that’s less than the common
price,’ said I, ‘instead of something over to pay
for the wickedness.’&mdash;All those sort of songs
come now to the streets, I believe all do, from
the concert-rooms. I can imitate any poetry.
I don’t recollect any poet I’ve imitated. No,
sir, not Scott or Moore, that I know of, but if
they’ve written popular songs, then I dare say
I have imitated them. Writing poetry is no
comfort to me in my sickness. It might if I
could write just what I please. The printers
like hanging subjects best, and I don’t. But
when any of them sends to order a copy of
verses for a ‘Sorrowful Lamentation’ of course
I must supply them. I don’t think much of
what I’ve done that way. If I’d my own fancy,
I’d keep writing acrostics, such as one I wrote
on our rector.” “God bless him,” interrupted
the wife, “he’s a good man.” “That he is,”
said the poet, “but he’s never seen what I wrote
about him, and perhaps never will.” He then
desired his wife to reach him his big Bible, and
out of it he handed me a piece of paper, with
the following lines written on it, in a small neat
hand enough:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“C elestial blessings hover round his head,</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">H undreds of poor, by his kindness were fed,</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">A nd precepts taught which he himself obeyed.</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">M an, erring man, brought to the fold of God,</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">P reaching pardon through a Saviour’s blood.</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">N o lukewarm priest, but firm to Heaven’s cause;</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">E xamples showed how much he loved its laws.</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">Y outh and age, he to their wants attends,</div>
       <div class="verse indent1">S teward of Christ&mdash;the poor man’s sterling friend.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“There would be some comfort, sir,” he continued,
“if one could go on writing at will like
that. As it is, I sometimes write verses all over
a slate, and rub them out again. Live hard!
yes, indeed, we do live hard. I hardly know
the taste of meat. We live on bread and butter,
and tea; no, not any fish. As you see, sir, I
work at tinning. I put new bottoms into old
tin tea-pots, and such like. Here’s my sort of
bench, by my poor bit of a bed. In the best
weeks I earn 4<i>s.</i> by tinning, never higher. In
bad weeks I earn only 1<i>s.</i> by it, and sometimes
not that,&mdash;and there are more shilling than four
shilling weeks by three to one. As to my
poetry, a good week is 3<i>s.</i>, and a poor week is
1<i>s.</i>&mdash;and sometimes I make nothing at all that
way. So I leave you to judge, sir, whether we
live hard; for the comings in, and what we have
from the parish, must keep six of us&mdash;myself,
my wife, and four children. It’s a long, hard
struggle.” “Yes, indeed,” said the wife, “it’s
just as you’ve heard my husband tell, sir.
We’ve 2<i>s.</i> a week and four loaves of bread from
the parish, and the rent’s 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the landlord
every week has 2<i>s.</i>,&mdash;and 6<i>d.</i> he has done
for him in tinning work. Oh, we do live hard,
indeed.”</p>

<p>As I was taking my leave, the poor man
expressed a desire that I would take a copy of
an epitaph which he had written for himself.
“If ever,” he said, “I am rich enough to provide
for a tomb-stone, or my family is rich
enough to give me one, this shall be my epitaph”
[I copied it from a blank page in his
Bible:]</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Stranger, pause, a moment stay,</div>
       <div class="verse">Tread lightly o’er this mound of clay.</div>
       <div class="verse">Here lies J&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;, in hopes to rise,</div>
       <div class="verse">And meet his Saviour in the skies.</div>
       <div class="verse">Christ his refuge, Heaven his home,</div>
       <div class="verse">Where pain and sorrow never come.</div>
       <div class="verse">His journey’s done, his trouble’s past,</div>
       <div class="verse">With God he sleeps in peace at last.”</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Broad-Sheets.</span></h3>

<p>The broad-sheet known in street-sale is an unfolded
sheet, varying in size, and printed on one
side. The word is frequently used to signify an
account of a murder or execution, but it may
contain an account of a fire, an “awful accident
and great loss of life,” a series of conundrums,
as in those called “Nuts to Crack,” a comic or
intended comic engraving, with a speech or some
verses, as recently in satire of the Pope and
Cardinal Wiseman (these are sometimes called
“comic exhibitions”), or a “bill of the play.”
The “cocks” are more frequently a smaller
size than the broad-sheet.</p>

<p>The sellers of these articles (play-bills excepted),
are of the class I have described as
patterers. The play-bill sellers are very rarely
patterers on other “paper work.” Some of
them are on the look-out during the day for a
job in porterage or such like, but they are not
mixed up with any pattering,&mdash;and a regular
patterer looks down upon a play-bill seller as a
poor creature, “fit for nothing but play-bills.”
I now proceed to describe such of these classes
as have not been previously given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Gallows” Literature of the
Streets.</span></h3>

<p>Under this head I class all the street-sold
publications which relate to the hanging of
malefactors. That the question is not of any
minor importance must be at once admitted,
when it is seen how very extensive a portion of
the reading of the poor is supplied by the
“Sorrowful Lamentations” and “Last Dying
Speech, Confession, and Execution” of criminals.
One paper-worker told me, that in some
small and obscure villages in Norfolk, which, he
believed, were visited only by himself in his line,
it was not very uncommon for two poor families
to <i>club</i> for 1<i>d.</i> to purchase an execution broad-sheet!
Not long after Rush was hung, he saw,
one evening after dark, through the uncurtained
cottage window, eleven persons, young and old,
gathered round a scanty fire, which was made
to blaze by being fed with a few sticks. An old
man was reading, to an attentive audience, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
broad-sheet of Rush’s execution, which my
informant had sold to him; he read by the
fire-light; for the very poor in those villages, I
was told, rarely lighted a candle on a spring
evening, saying that “a bit o’ fire was good
enough to talk by.” The scene must have
been impressive, for it had evidently somewhat
impressed the perhaps not very susceptible mind
of my informant.</p>

<p>The procedure on the occasion of a “good”
murder, or of a murder expected to “turn out
well,” is systematic. First appears a quarter-sheet
(a hand-bill, 9&frac12; in. by 7&frac12; in.) containing
the earliest report of the matter. Next come
half-sheets (twice the size) of later particulars,
or discoveries, or&mdash;if the supposed murderer be
in custody&mdash;of further examinations. The sale
of these bills is confined almost entirely to
London, and in their production the newspapers
are for the most part followed closely enough.
Then are produced the whole, or broad-sheets
(twice the size of the half-sheets), and, lastly,
but only on great occasions, the <i>double</i> broad-sheet.
[I have used the least technical terms
that I might not puzzle the reader with accounts
of “crowns,” “double-crowns,” &amp;c.]</p>

<p>The most important of all the broad-sheets
of executions, according to concurrent, and
indeed unanimous, testimony is the case of
Rush. I speak of the testimony of the street-folk
concerned, who all represent the sale of the
papers relative to Rush, both in town and
country, as the best in their experience of late
years.</p>

<p>The sheet bears the title of “The Sorrowful
Lamentation and Last Farewell of J. B. Rush,
who is ordered for Execution on Saturday next,
at Norwich Castle.” There are three illustrations.
The largest represents Rush, cloaked and
masked, “shooting Mr. Jermy, Sen.” Another
is of “Rush shooting Mrs. Jermy.” A prostrate
body is at her feet, and the lady herself is depicted
as having a very small waist and great
amplitude of gown-skirts. The third is a portrait
of Rush,&mdash;a correct copy, I was assured,
and have no reason to question the assurance,&mdash;from
one in the <i>Norwich Mercury</i>. The account
of the trial and biography of Rush, his conduct
in prison, &amp;c., is a concise and clear enough
condensation from the newspapers. Indeed,
Rush’s Sorrowful Lamentation is the best, in
all respects, of any execution broad-sheet I have
seen; even the “copy of verses” which, according
to the established custom, the criminal composes
in the condemned cell&mdash;his being unable,
in some instances, to read or write being no
obstacle to the composition&mdash;seems, in a literary
point of view, of a superior strain to the run of
such things. The matters of fact, however, are
introduced in the same peculiar manner. The
worst part is the morbid sympathy and intended
apology for the criminal. I give the verses
entire:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>Although the execution broad-sheet I have
cited may be the best, taken altogether, which
has fallen under my observation, nearly all I
have seen have one characteristic&mdash;the facts can
be plainly understood. The narrative, embracing
trial, biography, &amp;c., is usually prepared
by the printer, being a condensation from
the accounts in the newspapers, and is perhaps
intelligible, simply because it <i>is</i> a condensation.
It is so, moreover, in spite of bad grammar, and
sometimes perhaps from an unskilful connection
of the different eras of the trial.</p>

<p>When the circumstances of the case permit,
or can be at all constrained to do so, the Last
Sorrowful Lamentation contains a “Love Letter,”
written&mdash;as one patterer told me he had
occasionally expressed it, when he thought his
audience suitable&mdash;“from the depths of the
condemned cell, with the condemned pen, ink,
and paper.” The style is stereotyped, and
usually after this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear &mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;Shrink not from receiving a letter
from one who is condemned to die as a murderer.
Here, in my miserable cell, I write to one whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
from my first acquaintanceship, held in the highest
esteem, and whom, I believe, has also had the same
kindly feeling towards myself. Believe me, I forgive
all my enemies and bear no malice. O, my dear &mdash;&mdash;,
guard against giving way to evil passions, and a fondness
for drink. Be warned by my sad and pitiful
fate.”</p></div>

<p>If it be not feasible to have a love-letter&mdash;which
can be addressed to either wife or sweetheart&mdash;in
the foregoing style, a “last letter” is
given, and this can be written to father, mother,
son, daughter, or friend; and is usually to the
following purport:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Condemned Cell, &mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>“My Dear &mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;By the time you receive this my
hours, in this world, will indeed be short. It is an
old and true saying, that murderers will one day meet
their proper reward. No one can imagine the dreadful
nights of anguish passed by me since the commital of
the crime on poor &mdash;&mdash;. All my previous victims have
appeared before me in a thousand different shapes and
forms. My sufferings have been more than I can possibly
describe. Let me entreat you to turn from your
evil ways and lead a honest and sober life. I am suffering
so much at the present moment both from mind and
body that I can write no longer. Farewell! farewell!</p>

<p class="sig">
“Your affectionate &mdash;&mdash;.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>I have hitherto spoken of the Last Sorrowful
Lamentation sheets. The next broad-sheet is
the “Life, Trial, Confession, and Execution.”
This presents the same matter as the “Lamentation,”
except that a part&mdash;perhaps the judge’s
charge at the trial, or perhaps the biography&mdash;is
removed to make room for the “Execution,”
and occasionally for a portion of the
“Condemned Sermon.” To judge by the
productions I treat of, both subjects are marvelously
similar on all occasions. I cite a specimen
of the Condemned Sermon, as preached,
according to the broad-sheet, before Hewson,
condemned for the murder of a turnkey. It will
be seen that it is of a character to fit <i>any</i> condemned
sermon whatever:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The rev. gent. then turned his discourse particularly
to the unhappy prisoner doomed to die on the
morrow, and told him to call on Him who alone had
the power of forgiveness; who had said, ‘though his
sins were red as scarlet,’ he would ‘make them white
as snow,’ though he had been guilty of many heinous
crimes, there was yet an opportunity of forgiveness.&mdash;During
the delivery of this address, the prisoner was
in a very desponding state, and at its conclusion was
helped out of the chapel by the turnkeys.”</p></div>

<p>The “Execution” is detailed generally in
this manner. I cite the “Life, Trial, Confession
and Execution of Mary May, for the
Murder of W. Constable, her Half-brother, by
Poison, at Wix, near Manningtree:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At an early hour this morning the space before the
prison was very much crowded by persons anxious to
witness the execution of Mary May, for the murder of
William Constable, her half-brother, by poison, at Wix,
Manningtree, which gradually increased to such a degree,
that a great number of persons suffered extremely
from the pressure, and gladly gave up their places on
the first opportunity to escape from the crowd. The
sheriffs and their attendants arrived at the prison early
this morning and proceeded to the condemn cell, were
they found the reverend ordinary engaged in prayer
with the miserable woman. After the usual formalities
had been observed of demanding the body of the prisoner
into their custody she was then conducted to the
press-room. The executioner with his assistants then
commenced pinioning her arms, which opperation they
skillfully and quickly dispatched. During these awful
preparations the unhappy woman appeared mently to
suffer severely, but uttered not a word when the hour arrived
and all the arrangements having been completed,
the bell commenced tolling, and then a change was observed,
to come over the face of the prisoner, who
trembling violently, walked with the melancholy procession,
proceeded by the reverend ordinary, who read
aloud the funeral service for the dead. When the bell
commenced tolling a moment was heard from without,
and the words “Hats off,” and “Silence,” were distinctly
heard, from which time nothing but a continual
sobbing was heard. On arriving at the foot of the
steps leading to the scaffold she thanked the sheriffs
and the worthy governor of the prison, for their kind
attentions to her during her confinement; &amp; then the
unfortunate woman was seen on the scaffold, there was
a death like silence prevailed among the vast multitude
of people assembled. In a few seconds the bolt was
drawn, and, after a few convulsive struggles, the unhappy
woman ceased to exist.”</p></div>

<p>I cannot refrain from calling the reader’s
attention to the “copy of verses” touching
Mary May. I give them entire, for they seem
to me to contain all the elements which made
the old ballads popular&mdash;the rushing at once
into the subject&mdash;and the homely reflections,
though crude to all educated persons, are, nevertheless,
well adapted to enlist the sympathy and
appreciation of the class of hearers to whom
they are addressed:</p>

<p>This mode of procedure in “gallows” literature,
and this style of composition, have prevailed
for from twenty to thirty years. I find my usual
impossibility to <i>fix</i> a date among these street-folk;
but the Sorrowful Lamentation sheet was
unknown until the law for prolonging the term
of existence between the trial and death of the
capitally-convicted, was passed. “Before that,
sir,” I was told, “there wasn’t no time for a
Lamentation; sentence o’ Friday, and scragging
o’ Monday. So we had only the Life, Trial, and
Execution.” Before the year 1820, the Execution
broad-sheets, &amp;c., were “got up” in about
the same, though certainly in an inferior and
more slovenly manner than at present; and <i>one</i>
copy of verses often did service for the canticles
of all criminals condemned to be hung. These
verses were to sacred or psalm tunes, such as
Job, or the Old Hundredth. I was told by
an aged gentleman that he remembered, about
the year 1812, hearing a song, or, as he called it,
“stave,” of this description, not only given in
the street with fiddle and nasal twang, to the
tune of the Old Hundredth, but commencing in
the very words of Sternhold and <span class="lock">Hopkins&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“All people that on earth do dwell.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These “death-verses,” as they were sometimes
called, were very frequently sung by blind people,
and in some parts of the country blind men
and women still sing&mdash;generally to the accompaniment
of a fiddle&mdash;the “copy of verses.”
A London chaunter told me, that, a few years
back, he heard a blind man at York announce
the “verses” as from the “solitudes” of the
condemned cell. At present the broad-sheet
sellers usually sing, or chaunt, the copy of
verses.</p>

<p>An intelligent man, now himself a street-trader,
told me that one of the latest “execution
songs” (as he called them) which he remembered
to have heard in the old style&mdash;but
“no doubt there were plenty after that, as like
one another as peas in a boiling”&mdash;was on the
murder of Weare, at Elstree, in Hertfordshire.
He took great interest in such things when a
boy, and had the song in question by heart, but
could only depend upon his memory for the
first and second verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Come, all good Christians, praise the Lord,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And trust to him in hope.</div>
       <div class="verse">God in his mercy Jack Thurtell sent</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">To hang from Hertford gallows rope.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Poor Weare’s murder the Lord disclosed&mdash;</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Be glory to his name:</div>
       <div class="verse">And Thurtell, Hunt, and Probert too,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">Were brought to grief and shame.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another street paper-worker whom I spoke
to on the subject, and to whom I read these two
verses, said: “That’s just the old thing, sir;
and it’s quite in old Jemmy Catnach’s style, for
he used to write werses&mdash;anyhow, he said he did,
for I’ve heard him say so, and I’ve no doubt he
did in reality&mdash;it was just his favourite style, I
know, but the march of intellect put it out. It
did so.”</p>

<p>In the most “popular” murders, the street
“papers” are a mere recital from the newspapers,
but somewhat more brief, when the
suspected murderer is in custody; but when the
murderer has not been apprehended, or is unknown,
“then,” said one Death-hunter, “we
has our fling, and I’ve hit the mark a few
chances that way. We had, at the werry least,
half-a-dozen coves pulled up in the slums that
we printed for the murder of ‘The Beautiful
Eliza Grimwood, in the Waterloo-road.’ I did
best on Thomas Hopkins, being the guilty man&mdash;I
think he was Thomas Hopkins&mdash;’cause a
strong case was made out again him.”</p>

<p>I received similar accounts of the street-doings
in the case of “mysterious murders,”
as those perpetrations are called by the paper
workers, when the criminal has escaped, or
was unknown. Among those leaving considerable
scope to the patterer’s powers of invention
were the murders of Mr. Westwood, a
watchmaker in Prince’s-street, Leicester-square;
of Eliza Davis, a bar-maid, in Frederick-street,
Hampstead-road; and of the policeman in Dagenham,
Essex. One of the most successful
“cocks,” relating to murders which actually
occurred, was the “Confession to the Rev. Mr.
Cox, Chaplain of Aylesbury Gaol, of John
Tawell the Quaker.” I had some conversation
with one of the authors of this “Confession,”&mdash;for
it was got up by three patterers; and he
assured me that “it did well, and the facts was
soon in some of the newspapers&mdash;as what we
’riginates often is.” This sham confession was
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Rev. Mr. Cox, the chaplain of Aylesbury Gaol,
having been taken ill, and finding his end approaching,
sent for his son, and said, ‘Take this confession; now
I am as good as my word; I promised that unhappy
man, John Tawell, that while I lived his confession
should not be made public, owing to the excited state
of the public mind. Tawell confessed to me, that
besides the murder of Sarah Hart, at Salt-hill, for
which he suffered the last penalty of the law at Aylesbury,
he was guilty of two other barbarous murders
while abroad as a transport in Van Dieman’s Land.
One of these barbarous and horrid murders was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
body of one of the keepers. He knocked him down
with the keys, which he wrenched from him, and then
cut his throat with his own knife, leaving the body
locked up in his cell; and before that, to have the
better opportunity of having the turnkey single-handed,
John Tawell feigned illness. He then locked
the keeper, in the cell, and went to a young woman in
the town, a beautiful innkeeper’s daughter, whom he
had seduced as he worked for her father, as he had the
privilege of doing in the day-times. He went to her,
and she, seeing him in a flurried state, with blood
upon his hand, questioned him. He told the unhappy
young woman how he had killed the keeper for the
love of her, and the best thing to be done was for her
to get possession of all the money she could, and
escape with him to this country, where he would
marry her, and support her like a lady. The unhappy
young woman felt so terrified, that at the moment she
was unable to say yes or no. He became alarmed for
his safety, and with the identical knife that he killed
the keeper with, he left his unhappy victim a weltering
in her gore. He then fled from the house unobserved,
and went into the bush, where he met three
men, who had escaped through his killing the keeper.
He advised them to go down with him to an English
vessel lying off the coast. When they reached the
shore, they met a crew in search of fresh water; to
them they made out a pitiful story, and were taken on
board the ship. All being young men, and the captain
being short of hands, and one of them having been
really a seaman transported for mutiny, the captain,
after putting questions which the seaman answered,
engaged them to work their passage home. Tawell
was the captain of the gang, and was most looked up
to. They worked their passage home, behaving well
during the voyage, so that the captain said he would
make each of them a present, and never divulge.
When they reached Liverpool, Tawell robbed the captain’s
cabin of all the money contained in it, which
was a very considerable sum. After that he left Liverpool,
and adopted the garb of a Quaker, in which he
could not easily be recognized, and then pursued the
course of wickedness and crime which led him to a
shameful death.’”</p></div>

<p>The “confession” of Rush to the chaplain of
Norwich Castle, was another production which
was remunerative to the patterers. “There was
soon a bit of it in the newspapers,” said one
man, “for us and them treads close on one
another’s heels. The newspapers ‘screeved’
about Rush, and his mother, and his wife;
but we, in our patter, made him confess to
having murdered his old grandmother fourteen
years back, and how he buried her under the
apple-tree in the garden, and how he murdered
his wife as well.”</p>

<p>These ulterior Confessions are very rarely introduced,
in lieu of some matter displaced, into
the broad-sheet, but form separate bills. It was
necessary to mention them here, however, and
so preserve the sequence of the whole of the
traffic consequent upon a conviction for murder,
in this curious trade.</p>

<p>Sometimes the trial, &amp;c., form also separate
bills, as well as being embodied afterwards in
the Sorrowful Lamentation. This is only, however,
in cases which are deemed important.
One of the papers I obtained, for instance, is
the “Trial of Mr. and Mrs. Manning for the
Murder of Mr. Patrick O’Connor.” The trial
alone occupies a broad-sheet; it is fairly “got
up.” A portrait of Mr. Patrick O’Connor
heads the middle column. From the presence
of a fur collar to the coat or cloak, and of what
is evidently an order with its insignia, round
the neck, I have little doubt that the portrait
of Mr. O’Connor was originally that of the
sovereign in whose service O’Connor was once
an excise-officer&mdash;King William IV.</p>

<p>The last publication to which the trade has
recourse is “the book.” This is usually eight
pages, but sometimes only four of a larger size.
In authorship, matter, or compilation, it differs
little from the narratives I have described. The
majority of these books are prepared by one
man. They are in a better form for being preserved
as a record than is a broad-sheet, and
are frequently sold, and almost always offered
by the patterers when they cry a new case on a
sheet, as “people that loves such reading likes
to keep a good account of the best by them;
and so, when I’ve sold Manning’s bills, I’ve
often shoved off Rush’s books.” The books,
like the bills, have generally the letters and the
copy of verses.</p>

<p>Some of these books have the title-page set
forth in full display,&mdash;for example: “<i>Horrible
Murder and Mutilation of Lucy Game, aged 15,
by her Cruel Brother, William Game, aged 9,
at Westmill, Hertfordshire. His Committal and
Confession. With a Copy of Letter. Also, Full
Particulars of the Poisonings in Essex.</i>” Here,
as there was no execution, the matter was
extended, to include the poisonings in Essex.
The title I have quoted is expanded into thirteen
lines. Sometimes the title-page is adorned
with a portrait. One, I was told, which was last
employed as a portrait of Calcraft, had done
severe service since Courvoisier’s time,&mdash;for
my informant thought that Courvoisier was the
original. It is the bust of an ill-looking man,
with coat and waistcoat fitting with that unwrinkled
closeness which characterises the figures
in tailors’ “fashions.”</p>

<p>The above style of work is known in the trade
as “the book;” but other publications, in the
book or pamphlet form, are common enough. In
some I have seen, the title-page is a history in
little. I cite one of these:&mdash;“<i>Founded on Facts.
The Whitby Tragedy; or, the Gambler’s Fate.
Containing the Lives of Joseph Carr, aged 21, and
his sweetheart, Maria Leslie, aged 19, who were
found Dead, lying by each other, on the morning
of the 23rd of May. Maria was on her road to
Town to buy some Ribbon, &amp;c., for her Wedding
Day, when her lover in a state of intoxication fired
at her, and then run to rob his prey, but finding it
to be his Sweetheart, reloaded his Gun, placed the
Muzzle to his Mouth, and blew out his Brains, all
through cursed Cards, Drink, &amp;c. Also, an affectionate
Copy of Verses.</i>”</p>

<p>To show the extent of the trade in execution
broad-sheets, I obtained returns of the number
of copies relating to the principal executions of
late, that had been sold:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Of Thurtell I could obtain no accounts&mdash;“it
was so long ago;” but the sale, I was told, was
enormous. Reckoning that each copy was sold
for 1<i>d.</i> (the regular price in the country, where
the great sale is,) the money expended for such
things amounts to upwards of 48,500<i>l.</i> in the
case of the six murderers above given. All
this number was printed and got up in London;
a few “broad-sheets” concerning Rush
were printed also in Norwich.</p>

<p>Touching the issue of “cocks,” a person connected
with the trade calculated for me, from
data at his command, that 3,456 copies were
struck off weekly, and sold in the streets, in the
metropolis; and reckoning them at only a &frac12;<i>d.</i>
each, we have the sum of 7<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> spent every
week in this manner. At this rate, there must
be 179,712 copies of “cocks” printed in a year,
on which the public expend no less than 374<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Of the style of illustrations usually accompanying
this class of street literature the two
large engravings here given are <i>fac similes</i>&mdash;while
the smaller ones are faithful copies of the
average embellishments to the halfpenny ballads.
On another occasion I shall speak at length on
“Street-Art.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Conundrums.</span></h3>

<p>Among the more modern street sales are
“conundrums,” generally vended, both in the
shops and the streets, as “Nuts to Crack,”
when not in the form of books. This is another
of the “broad-sheets,” and is sufficiently
clever and curious in its way.</p>

<p>In the centre, at the top, is the “Wonderful
Picture,” with the following description: “This
Picture when looked at from a particular point
of view, will not only appear perfect in all respects
and free from distortion, but the figures
will actually appear to stand out in relief from
the paper.” The wonderful picture, which is
a rude imitation of a similar toy picture sold
in a box, “with eye-piece complete,” at the
shops, presents a distorted view of a church-spire,
a light-house, a donjon-keep, castellated
buildings backed by mountains, a moat on which
are two vessels, an arch surmounted by a Britannia,
a palm-tree (I presume), and a rampart,
or pier, or something that way, on which
are depicted two figures, with the gestures of
elocutionists. The buildings are elongated,
like shadows at sunset or sunrise. What may
be the “particular point of view” announced
in the description of the Wonderful Picture,
is not described in the “Nuts,” but the following
explanation is given in a little book,
published simultaneously, and entitled, “The
Nutcrackers, a Key to Nuts to Crack, or Enigmatical
Repository:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Wonderful Picture.</span>&mdash;Cut out a piece of
cardboard 2&frac12; inches long, make a round hole about
the size of a pea in the top of it; place this level with
the right-hand side of the Engraving and just 1&frac12; inches
distant from it, then apply your eye to the little hole
and look at the picture, and you will find that a beautiful
symmetry pervades the landscape, there is not
the slightest appearance of distortion, and the different
parts appear actually to stand up in relief on the
paper.”</p></div>

<p>Below the “Wonderful Picture” are other
illustrations; and the border of the broad-sheet
presents a series of what may be called
pictorial engravings. The first is,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<a id="D_I_O_C_C"></a>
<img src="images/0580a.png" width="493" height="186" alt="D I O
C C
1.&mdash;Lately presented to a “Wise
man” by a usurper." />

</div>

<p>The answer being evidently “Diocese.” No.
26 is</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">
<a id="A_4"></a>
<img src="images/0580b.png" width="492" height="187" alt="
Picture of a pin
A 4
26.&mdash;The Child’s “Tidy.”" />

</div>

<p>“Pinafore” is the solution. Of the next “hieroglyphic”&mdash;for
a second title to the “Nuts”
tells of “200 Hieroglyphics, Enigmas, Conundrums,
Curious Puzzles, and other Ingenious
Devices,”&mdash;I cannot speak very highly. It
consists of “AIMER,” (a figure of a hare at full
speed,) and “EKA.” Answer.&mdash;“America.”</p>

<p>In the body of the broad-sheet are the
Enigmas, &amp;c., announced; of each of which I
give a specimen, to show the nature of this
street performance or entertainment. Enigma
107 <span class="lock">is&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“I’ve got no wings, yet in the air</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">I often rise and fall;</div>
       <div class="verse">I’ve got no feet, yet clogs I wear,</div>
       <div class="verse indent2">And shoes, and boots, and all.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the answer is foot-ball, the two last lines
should manifestly have been placed first.</p>

<p>The “Conundrums” are next in the arrangement,
and I cite one of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why are there, strictly speaking, only 325 days in
the year?”</p></div>

<p>“Because,” is the reply, “forty of them are
lent and never returned.” The “Riddles” follow
in this portion of the “Nuts to Crack.” Of
these, one is not very difficult to be solved,
though it is distinguished for the usual grammatical
confusion of tenses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A man has three daughters, and each of these
have a brother. How many children had he?”</p></div>

<p>The “Charades” complete the series. Of these
I select one of the best:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“I am a word of letters seven,</div>
       <div class="verse">I’m sinful in the sight of heaven,</div>
       <div class="verse">To every virtue I’m opposed,</div>
       <div class="verse">Man’s weary life I’ve often closed.</div>
       <div class="verse">If to me you prefix two letters more,</div>
       <div class="verse">I mean exactly what I meant before.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The other parts of the letter-press consist of
“Anagrams,” “Transpositions,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>When a clever patterer “works conundrums”&mdash;for
the trade is in the hands of the pattering
class&mdash;he selects what he may consider the best,
and reads or repeats them in the street, sometimes
with and sometimes without the answer.
But he does not cripple the probable quickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of his sale by a slavish adherence to what is in
type. He puts the matter, as it were, personally.
“What gentleman is it,” one man told me he
would ask, “in this street, that <span class="lock">has&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘Eyes like saucers, a back like a box,</div>
       <div class="verse">A nose like a pen-knife, and a voice like a fox?’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You can learn for a penny. Or sometimes I’ll
go on with the patter, thus,” he continued,
“What lady is it that we have all seen, and
who can say <span class="lock">truly&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘I am brighter than day, I am swifter than light,</div>
       <div class="verse">And stronger than all the momentum of might?’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>More than once people have sung out ‘the
Queen,’ for they seem to think that the momentum
of might couldn’t fit any one else.
It’s ‘thought’ as is the answer, but it wouldn’t
do to let people think it’s anything of the sort.
It must seem to fit <i>somebody</i>. If I see a
tailor’s name on a door, as soon as I’ve passed
the corner of the street, and sometimes in the
same street, I’ve <span class="lock">asked&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Why is Mr. So-and-so, the busy tailor of this (or
the next street) never at home?’</p></div>

<p>‘Because he’s always cutting out.’ I have the
same questions for other tradesmen, and for
gentlemen and ladies in this neighbourhood, and
no gammon. All for a penny. Nuts to Crack,
a penny. A pair of Nutcrackers to crack
’em, only one penny.”</p>

<p>Sometimes this man, who perhaps is the
smartest in the trade, will take a bolder flight
still, and when he knows the residence of any
professional or public man, he will, if the allusion
be complimentary, announce his name, or&mdash;if
there be any satire&mdash;indicate by a motion
of the head, or a gesture of the hand,
the direction of his residence. My ingenuous,
and certainly ingenious, informant obliged me
with a few instances:&mdash;“In Whitechapel
parish I’ve said&mdash;it ain’t in the print, it was
only in the patter&mdash;‘Why won’t the Reverend
Mr. Champneys lay up treasures on
earth?’&mdash;‘Because he’d rather lay up treasures
in heaven.’ That’s the reverend gentleman
not far from this spot; but in this sheet&mdash;with
nearly 100 engravings by the first artists, only
a penny&mdash;I have other questions for other
parsons, not so easy answered; nuts as is hard
to crack. ‘Why is the Reverend Mr. Popjoy,’
or the Honourable Lawyer Bully, or Judge
Wiggem,&mdash;and then I just jerks my thumb, sir,
if it’s where I know or think such people live&mdash;‘Why
is the Reverend Mr. Popjoy (or the
others) like <i>two</i> balloons, one in the air to the
east, and the ’tother in the air to the west, in
this parish of St. George’s, Hanover-square?’
There’s no such question, and as it’s a sort of
a ‘cock,’ of course there’s no answer. I don’t
know one. But a gentleman’s servant once sung
out: ‘’Cause he’s uppish.’ And a man in a
leather apron once said: ‘He’s a raising the
wind,’ which was nonsense. But I like that
sort of interruption, and have said&mdash;‘You’ll not
find <i>that</i> answer in the Nutcrackers,’ only a
penny&mdash;and, Lord knows, I told the truth when
I said so, and it helps the sale. No fear of any
one’s finding out all what’s in the sheet before
I’m out of the ‘drag.’ Not a bit. And you
must admit that any way it’s a cheap pennorth.”
That it is a cheap harmless pennyworth
is undeniable.</p>

<p>The street-sale of conundrums is carried on
most extensively during a week or two before
Christmas; and on summer evenings, when
the day’s work is, or ought to be, over even
among the operatives of the slop employers.
As the conundrum patterer requires an audience,
he works the quieter streets, preferring
such as have no horse-thoroughfare&mdash;as in
some of the approaches from the direction of
Golden-square to Regent-street. The trade is
irregularly pursued, none following it all the
year; and from the best information I could
acquire, it appears that fifteen men may be
computed as working conundrums for two
months throughout the twelve, and clearing
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, per individual. The cost
of the “Nuts to Crack” (when new) is 5<i>d.</i> a
doz. to the seller; but old “Nuts” often answer
the purpose of the street-seller, and may be had
for about half the price; the cost of the “Nut-crackers”
2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It may be calculated,
then, that to realize the 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 15<i>s.</i> must
be taken. This shows the street expenditure
in “Nuts to Crack” and “Nut-crackers” to be
90<i>l.</i> yearly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Comic Exhibitions,
Magical Delusions, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>The street sale of “Comic Exhibitions” (properly
so called) is, of course, as modern as the last
autumn and winter; and it is somewhat curious
that the sale of any humorous, or meant to
be humorous sheet of engravings, is now becoming
very generally known in the street sale
as a “Comic Exhibition.” Among these&mdash;as I
have before intimated&mdash;are many caricatures of
the Pope, the Church of Rome, Cardinal Wiseman,
the Church of England, the Bishop of
London (or any bishop or dignitary), or of any
characteristic of the conflicting creeds. In many
of these, John Bull figures personally, and so
does the devil.</p>

<p>The Comic Exhibition (proper) is certainly a
very cheap pennyworth. No. 1 is entitled, “The
Ceremonial of the Opening of the Great Exhibition,
in 1851, with Illustrations of the Contributions
of All Nations.” The “contributions,”
however, are reserved for Nos. 2 and 3. Two
larger “cuts,” at the head of the broad-sheet,
may be considered geographical, as regards the
first, and allegorical as regards the second.
“Table Bay” presents a huge feeder (evidently),
and the “Cape of Good Hope” is a
spare man obsequiously bowing to the table and
its guest in good hope of a dinner. Of the
Sandwich Islands and of Hung(a)ry, the “exhibition”
is of the same description. The second
larger cut shows the Crystal Palace ascending
by the agency of a balloon, a host of people of
all countries looking on. Then comes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
“Procession from Palace-yard to Hyde Park.”
The first figure in this procession is described
as “Beefeaters piping hot and well puffed out,”
though there is but one beefeater, with head
larger than his body and legs ridiculously small,
(as have nearly all the sequent figures), smoking
a pipe as if it were a trombone, duly
followed by “Her Majesty’s Spiritual Body-guard”
(five beefeaters, drunk), and by “Prince
Albert blowing his own trumpet” (from the
back of a very sorry steed), with “Mops and
brooms,” and a “Cook-oo” (a housemaid and
cook) as his supporters. Then follow figures,
grotesque enough, of which the titles convey
the character: “A famous Well-in-Town;”
“Nae Peer-ye;” “Humorous Estimates”
(Mr. Hume); “A Jew-d’ esprit” (Mr. D’Israeli);
“An exemplification of Cupidity in
Pummicestone” (Lord Palmerston); “Old
Geese” and “Young Ducks” (old and angry-looking
and young and pretty women); “Some
gentlemen who patronise Moses in the Minories”
(certainly no credit to the skill of a tailor);
“A Jew Lion” (M. Jullien); “Fine high
screams” (ice-creams) and “Capers” (chorister
boys and ballet-girls); “Hey-day, you don’t
take advantage here” (Joseph Ady); and
“Something to give the milk a head” (a man
with a horse’s head on a tray). These, however,
are but a portion of the figures. The Comic
Exhibition-sheet contains ninety such figures,
independent of those in the two cuts mentioned
as headings.</p>

<p>“Galleries of Comicalities,” or series of figures
sometimes satirically, sometimes grotesquely
given without any aim at satire, are also sold by
the same parties, and are often announced as a
“Threepenny gallery for a penny!&mdash;and dirt
cheap at threepence. As big as a newspaper.”</p>

<p>Another broad-sheet sold this winter in the
streets is entitled, “Optical and Magical Delusions,”
and was announced as “Dedicated to
and Prepared for his Royal Highness the Prince
of Wales&mdash;the only original copy.” The engravings
are six in number, and are in three
rows, each accompanying engraving being reversed
from its fellow: where the head is erect on
one side, it is downward on the other. The first
figure is a short length of a very plain woman,
while on the opposite side is that of a very plain
man, both pleased and smirking in accordance
with a line below: “O what joy when our lips
shall meet!” “Cat-a-gorical” is a spectacled
and hooded cat. “Dog-matical” is a dog with
the hat, wig, and cane once held proper to a
physician. “Cross purposes” is an austere
lady in a monster cap, while her opposite husband
is pointing bitterly to a long bill. The
purport of these figures is shown in the following</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“DIRECTIONS&mdash;Paste all over the Back of the
sheet, and put a piece of thick paper between, to stiffen
it, then fold it down the centre, so that the marginal
lines fall exactly at the back of each other, (which may
be ascertained by holding it to the light)&mdash;press it quite
flat&mdash;when cut separate they will make three cards&mdash;shave
them close to the margin&mdash;then take a needlefull
of double thread and pass it through the dot at
each end of the card; cut the thread off about three
inches long. By twisting the threads between your
fore fingers and thumbs, so as to spin the card round
backwards and forwards with a rapid motion, the
figures will appear to connect and form a pleasing
delusion.”</p></div>

<p>Then there are the “Magical Figures,” or
rude street imitations of Dr. Paris’ ingenious
toy, called the “Thaumascope.” Beside these
are what at the first glance appear mere black,
and very black, marks, defining no object; but
a closer examination shows the outlines of a
face, or of a face and figure. Of such there are
sometimes four on a broad-sheet, but they are
also sold separately, both in the streets and the
small stationers’ shops. When the white or
black portion of the paper is cut away (for both
colours are so prepared), what remains, by a
disposition of the light, throws a huge shadow
of a grotesque figure on the wall, which may
be increased or diminished according to the
motions of the exhibitor. The shadow-figures
sold this winter by one of my informants were
of Mr. and Mrs. Manning, the Queen, Prince
Albert, the Princess Royal, and the Prince of
Wales; “but you see, sir,” observed the man,
“the Queen and the Prince does for any father
and mother&mdash;for she hasn’t her crown on&mdash;and
the Queen’s kids for anybody’s kids.”</p>

<p>I mention these matters more particularly, as
it certainly shows something of a change in the
winter-evenings’ amusements of the children of
the working-classes. The principal street customers
for these penny papers were mechanics,
who bought them on their way home for the
amusement of their families. Boys, however,
bought almost as many.</p>

<p>The sale of these papers is carried on by the
same men as I have described working conundrums.
A superior patterer, of course, shows
that his magical delusions and magical figures
combine all the wonders of the magic lantern
and the dissolving views, “and all for one
penny.” The trade is carried on only for a
short time in the winter as regards the magical
portion; and I am informed that, including the
“Comic Exhibitions,” it extends to about half of
the sum taken for conundrums, or to about 45<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Play-Bills.</span></h3>

<p>The sellers of play-bills carry on a trade which
is exceedingly uncertain, and is little remunerative.
There are now rather more than 200
people selling play-bills in London, but the
number has sometimes been as high as 400.
“Yes, indeed,” a theatrical gentleman said to
me, “and if a dozen more theatres were opened
to-morrow, why each would have more than its
twenty bill-sellers the very first night. Where
they come from, or what they are, I haven’t a
notion.”</p>

<p>The majority of the play-bill sellers are either
old or young, the sexes being about equally
engaged in this traffic. Some of them have
followed the business from their childhood. I
met with very few indeed who knew anything of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
theatres beyond the names of the managers and
of the principal performers, while some do not
even enjoy that small modicum of knowledge,
and some can neither read nor write. The boys
often run recklessly alongside the cabs which
are conveying persons to the theatre, and so offer
their bills for sale. One of these youths said to
me, when I spoke of the danger incurred, “The
cabman knows how to do it, sir, when I runs
and patters; and so does his hoss.” An intelligent
cabman, however, who was in the habit
of driving parties to the Lyceum, told me that
these lads clung to his cab as he drove down to
Wellington-street in such a way, for they seemed
never to look before them, that he was in constant
fear lest they should be run over. Ladies
are often startled by a face appearing suddenly
at the cab window, “and thro’ my glass,” said
my informant, “a face would look dirtier than
it really is.” And certainly a face gliding along
with the cab, as it were, no accompanying body
being visible, on a winter’s night, while the sound
of the runner’s footsteps is lost in the noise of
the cab, has much the effect of an apparition.</p>

<p>I did not hear of one person who had been in
any way connected with the stage, even as a
supernumerary, resorting to play-bill selling
when he could not earn a shilling within the walls
of a theatre. These bill-sellers, for the most
part, confine themselves, as far as I could ascertain,
to that particular trade. The youths say
that they sometimes get a job in errand-going
in the daytime, but the old men and women
generally aver they can do nothing else. An
officer, who, some years back, had been on duty
at a large theatre, told me that at that time the
women bill-sellers earned a trifle in running
errands for the women of the town who attended
the theatres; but, as they were not permitted to
send any communication into the interior of the
house, their earnings that way were insignificant,
for they could only send in messages by any
other “dress woman” entering the theatre subsequently.</p>

<p>In the course of my inquiries last year, I met
with a lame woman of sixty-eight, who had been
selling play-bills for the last twelve years. She
had been, for six or eight months before she
adopted that trade, the widow of a poor mechanic,
a carpenter. She had first thought of resorting
to that means of a livelihood owing to a
neighbouring old woman having been obliged to
relinquish her post from sickness, when my
informant “succeeded her.” In this way, she
said, many persons “succeeded” to the business,
as the recognised old hands were jealous of and
uncivil to any additional new comers, but did
not object to a “successor.” These parties
generally know each other; they murmur if the
Haymarket hands, for instance, resort to the
Lyceum for any cause, or <i>vice versâ</i>, thus over-stocking
the business, but they offer no other
opposition. The old woman further informed me
that she commenced selling play-bills at Astley’s,
and then realized a profit of 4<i>s.</i> per week.
When the old Amphitheatre was burnt down,
she went to the Victoria; but “business was
not what it was,” and her earnings were from
6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a week less; and this, she said, although
the Victoria was considered one of the
most profitable stations for the play-bill seller,
the box-keeper there seldom selling any bill in
the theatre. “The boxes,” too, at this house,
more frequently buy them outside. Another
reason why “business” was better at the Victoria
than elsewhere was represented to me, by
a person familiar with the theatres, to be this:
many go to the Victoria who cannot read, or who
can read but imperfectly, and they love to
“make-believe” they are “good scholards” by
parading the consulting of a play-bill!</p>

<p>On my visit the bill-sellers at the Victoria
were two old women (each a widow for many
years), two young men, besides two or three,
though there are sometimes as many as six or
seven children. The old women “fell into the
business” as successors by virtue of their predecessors’
leaving it on account of sickness. The
children were generally connected with the older
dealers. The young men had been in this business
from boyhood; some sticking to the practice
of their childhood unto manhood, or towards old
age. The number at the Victoria is now, I am
informed, two or three more, as the theatre is
often crowded. The old woman told me that
she had known two and even four visitors to the
theatre club for the purchase of a bill, and then
she had sometimes to get farthings for them.</p>

<p>A young fellow&mdash;who said he believed he was
only eighteen, but certainly looked older&mdash;told
me that he was in the habit of selling play-bills,
but not regularly, as he sometimes had a job in
carrying a board, or delivering bills at a corner,
“or the likes o’ that;”&mdash;he favoured me with
his opinion of the merits of the theatres he was
practically acquainted with as regarded their
construction for the purposes of the bill-seller.
His mother, who had been dead a few years, had
sold bills, and had put him into the business.
His ambition seemed to be to become a general
bill-sticker. He could not write but could read
very imperfectly.</p>

<p>“Vy, you see, sir,” he said, “there’s sets off.
At the Market (Haymarket), now, there’s this:
there’s only one front, so you may look sharp
about for there goes, boxes, pit, and gallery.
The ’Delphis as good that way, and so is the
Surrey, but them one’s crowded too much.
The Lyceum’s built shocking orkered. Vy,
the boxes is in one street, and the pit in another,
and the gallery in another! It’s true,
sir. The pit’s the best customer in most
theatres, I think. Ashley’s and the Wick is both
spoiled that way&mdash;Ashley’s perticler&mdash;as the
gallery’s a good step from the pit and boxes;
at the Wick it’s round the corner. But the
shilling gallery aint so bad at Ashley’s. Sadler’s
Wells I never tried, it’s out of the way,
and I can’t tell you much about the ’Lympic
or the Strand. The Lane is middling. I don’t
know that either plays or actors makes much
difference to me. Perhaps it’s rather vorser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ven it’s anything werry prime, as everybody
seems to know every think about it aforehand.
No, sir, I can’t say, sir, that Mr. Macready did
me much good. I sometimes runs along by a
cab because I’ve got a sixpence from a swell
for doing it stunnin’, but werry seldom, and I
don’t much like it; though ven you’re at it you
don’t think of no fear. I makes 3<i>s.</i> or rather
more a week at bill-selling, and as much other
vays. I never saw a play but once at the Wick.
I’d rather be at a Free and Heasy. I don’t
know as I knows any of the actors or actresses,
either hes or shes.”</p>

<p>The sellers of play-bills purchase their stock
of the printer, at 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> the hundred, or in
that proportion for half or quarter-hundreds.
If a smaller quantity be purchased, the charge
is usually thirteen for 6<i>d.</i>; though they used to
be only twelve for 6<i>d.</i> These sellers are among
the poorest of the poor; after they have had one
meal, they do not know how to get another.
They reside in the lowest localities, and some
few are abandoned and profligate in character.
They reckon it a good night to earn 1<i>s.</i> clear,
but upon an average they clear but 3<i>s.</i> per week.
They lose sometimes by not selling out their
nightly stock. What they have left, they are
obliged to sell for waste-paper at 2<i>d.</i> per lb.
Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide are generally
their best times&mdash;they will then make 9<i>d.</i>
per night clear. The printer of the play-bills
prints but a certain number, the demand being
nearly ascertained week by week. These
are all sold (by the printer or some person
appointed) to the regular customers, in preference
to others, but the “irregulars” can get supplied,
though often not without trouble. The
profit on all sold is rather more than cent. per
cent. As I have intimated, when some theatres
are closed, the bill-sellers are driven to others;
and as the demand is necessarily limited,
a superflux of sellers affects the profits, and
then 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is considered a good week’s work.
During the opera season, I am told, a few mechanics,
out of work, will sell bills there and
books of the opera, making about 6<i>s.</i> a week,
and doing better than the regular hands, as they
have a better address and are better clad.</p>

<p>Taking the profits at 3<i>s.</i> a week at cent. per
cent. on the outlay, and reckoning 200 sellers,
including those at the saloons, concert-rooms,
&amp;c., we find that 60<i>l.</i> is now expended weekly
on play-bills purchased in the streets of London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Periodicals,
Pamphlets, Tracts, Books, etc.</span></h3>

<p>These street-sellers are a numerous body, and
the majority of them show a greater degree of
industry and energy than is common to many
classes of street-folk. They have been for the
most part connected with the paper, newspaper,
or publishing trade, and some of them have
“known better days.” One intelligent man I
met with, a dealer in “waste” (paper), had
been brought up as a compositor, but late hours
and glaring gas-lights in the printing-office
affected his eyes, he told me; and as a half-blind
compositor was about of as little value, he
thought, as a “horse with a wooden leg,” he
abandoned his calling for out-of-door labour.
Another had been a gun-smith, and when out
of his apprenticeship was considered a “don
hand at hair triggers, for hair triggers were more
wanted then,” but an injury to his right hand
and arm had disabled him as a mechanic, and
he had recourse to the streets. A third had
been an ink-maker’s “young man,” and had
got to like the streets by calling for orders, and
delivering bottles of ink, at the shops of the
small stationers and chandlers, and so he had
taken to them for a living. Of the book-stall-keepers
I heard of one man who had died a
short time before, and who “once had been in
the habit of buying better books for his own
pleasure than he had afterwards to sell for his
bread.” Of the book-stall proprietors, I have
afterwards spoken more fully.</p>

<p>All the street-sellers in question are what
street estimation pronounces to be educated
men; they can all, as far as I could ascertain,
read and write, and some of them were “keenish
politicians, both free-traders, and against
free-trade when they was a-talking of the better
days when they was young.” Nearly all are
married men with families.</p>

<p>The divisions into which these street traffickers
may be formed are&mdash;Odd Number-sellers&mdash;Steamboat
Newsvendors&mdash;Railway
Newsvendors, (though the latter is now hardly a
street traffic),&mdash;the Sellers of Second Editions
(which I have already given as a portion of the
patterers)&mdash;Board-workers (also previously described,
and for the same reason)&mdash;Tract-sellers
(of whom I have given the number, character,
&amp;c., and who are regarded by the other street-sellers
as the idlers, beggars, and pretenders of
the trade),&mdash;the Sellers of Childrens’ Books and
Song Books&mdash;Book-auctioneers, and Book-stall-keepers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Back Numbers.</span></h3>

<p>This trade is carried on by the same class of
patterers as work race-cards, second editions, &amp;c.
The collectors of waste-paper frequently find
back numbers of periodicals in “a lot” they
may have purchased at a coffee-shop. These
they sell to warehousemen who serve the street-sellers.
The largest lot ever sold at one time
was some six or seven years ago, of the <i>Pictorial
Times</i>, at least a ton weight. A dealer <span class="lock">states&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I lost the use of this arm ever since I was
three months old. My mother died when I
was ten years of age, and after that my father
took up with an Irishwoman, and turned me
and my youngest sister (she was two years
younger than me) out into the streets. My
youngest sister got employment at my father’s
trade, but I couldn’t get no work because of
my crippled arm. I walked about, till I fell
down in the streets for want. At last, a man,
who had a sweetmeat-shop, took pity on me.
His wife made the sweetmeats, and minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the shop while he went out a juggling in the
streets, in the Ramo Samee line. He told me
as how, if I would go round the country with
him and sell a few prints while he was a juggling
in the public-houses, he’d find me in
wittles, and pay my lodging. I joined him,
and stopped with him two or three year.
After that I went to work for a werry
large waste-paper dealer. He used to buy
up all the old back numbers of the cheap
periodicals and penny publications, and send
me out with them to sell at a farden’ a piece.
He used to give me 4<i>d.</i> out of every shilling,
and I done very well with that, till the periodicals
came so low, and so many on ’em, that they
wouldn’t sell at all. Sometimes I could make
15<i>s.</i> on a Saturday night and a Sunday morning,
a-selling the odd numbers of periodicals,&mdash;such
as tales; ‘Tales of the Wars,’ ‘Lives of the
Pirates,’ ‘Lives of the Highwaymen,’ &amp;c. I’ve
often sold as many as 2,000 numbers on a
Saturday night in the New-cut, and the most
of them was works about thieves, and highwaymen,
and pirates. Besides me, there was three
others at the same business. Altogether, I dare
say my master alone used to get rid of 10,000
copies of such works on a Saturday night and a
Sunday morning. Our principal customers was
young men. My master made a good bit of
money at it. He had been about eighteen
years in the business, and had begun with 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
I was with him fifteen year, on and off, and at
the best time. I used to earn my 30<i>s.</i> a week
full at that time. But then I was foolish, and
didn’t take care of my money. When I was at
the ‘odd number business,’ I bought a peep-show,
and left the trade to go into that line.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sale of Waste Newspapers at
Billingsgate.</span></h3>

<p>This trade is so far peculiar that it is confined
to Billingsgate, as in that market alone the
demand supplies a livelihood to the man who
carries it on. His principal sale is of newspapers
to the street-fishmongers, as a large surface
of paper is required for the purposes of a
fish-stall. The “waste” trade&mdash;for “waste”
and not “waste-paper” is the word always applied&mdash;is
not carried on with such facility as
might be expected, for I was assured that
“waste” is so scarce that only a very insufficient
supply of paper can at present be obtained.
“I hope things will change soon, sir,”
said one collector, gravely to me, “or I shall
hardly be able to keep myself and my family on
my waste.”</p>

<p>This difficulty, however, does not affect such
a street-seller as the man at Billingsgate, who
buys of the collectors&mdash;“collecting,” however,
a portion himself at the neighbouring coffee-shops,
public houses, &amp;c.; for the wants of a
regular customer must, by some means or other,
be supplied.</p>

<p>The Billingsgate paper-seller carries his paper
round, offering it to his customers, or to those he
wishes to make purchasers; some fishmongers,
however, obtain their “waste” first-hand from
the collectors, or buy it at a news-agent’s.</p>

<p>The retail price varies from 2<i>d.</i> to 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> the
pound, but 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> is only given for “very clean
and prime, and perhaps uncut,” newspapers;
for when a newsvendor has, as it is called,
“over-stocked” himself, he sells the uncut
papers at last to the collector, or the “waste” consumer.
This happens, I was told, twenty times
as often with the “weeklys” as the “dailys;”
for, said my informant, “suppose it’s a wet Sunday
morning&mdash;and all newsvendors as does pray,
prays for wet Sundays, because then people
stays at home and buys a paper, or some
number, to read and pass away the time. Well,
sir, suppose it’s a soaker in the morning, the
newsman buys a good lot, an extra nine, or two
extra nines, or the like of that, and then may
be, after all, it comes out a fine day, and so he’s
over-stocked; in which case there’s some for
the waste.”</p>

<p>When they consider it a favourable opportunity,
the workers carry waste to offer to the
Billingsgate salesmen; but the chief trade is
in the hands of the regular frequenter of the
market.</p>

<p>From the best information I could obtain, it
appears that from 70 to 100 pounds weight of
“waste”&mdash;about three-fourths being newspapers,
of which some are foreign&mdash;is supplied to Billingsgate
market and its visitants. Two numbers
of the <i>Times</i>, with their supplements, one
paper-buyer told me, “when cleverly damped,
and they’re never particularly dry,” will weigh
about a pound. The average price is not less
than 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound, or from that to 3<i>d.</i> A single
paper is 1<i>d.</i> At 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per pound, and 85 pounds
a day, upwards of 275<i>l.</i> is spent yearly in waste
paper at Billingsgate, in the street or open-air
purchase alone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sale of Periodicals on the Steam-boats
and Steam-boat Piers.</span></h3>

<p>In this traffic are engaged about 20 men,
“when the days are light until eight o’clock;”
from 10 to 15, if the winter be a hard winter;
and if the river steamers are unable to run&mdash;none
at all. This winter, however, there has
been no cessation in the running of the “boats,”
except on a few foggy days. The steam-boat
paper-sellers are generally traders on their own
account (all, I believe, have been connected
with the newsvendors’ trade); some few are the
servants of newsvendors, sent out to deal at
the wharfs and on board the boats.</p>

<p>The trade is not so remunerative that any
payment is made to the proprietors of the boats
or wharfs for the privilege of selling papers
there (as in the case of the railways), but it is
necessary to “obtain leave,” from those who
have authority to give it.</p>

<p>The steam-boat paper-seller steps on board a
few minutes before the boat starts, when there
are a sufficient number of voyagers assembled.
He traverses the deck and dives into the cabins,
offering his “papers,” the titles of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
announces: “Punch, penny Punch, <i>real</i> Punch,
last number for 3<i>d.</i>&mdash;comic sheets, a penny&mdash;all
the London periodicals&mdash;Guide to the
Thames.”</p>

<p>From one of these frequenters of steam-boats
for the purposes of his business, I had the
following account:</p>

<p>“I was a news-agent’s boy, sir, near a pier,
for three or four year, then I got a start for
myself, and now I serve a pier. It’s not such
a trade as you might think, still it’s bread and
cheese and a drop of beer. I go on board to
sell my papers. It’s seldom I sell a newspaper;
there’s no call for it on the river, except
at the foreign-going ships&mdash;a few as is
sold to them&mdash;but I don’t serve none on ’em.
People reads the news for nothing at the coffee-shops
when they breakfasts, I s’pose, and
goes on as if they took in the <i>Times</i>, <i>Chron</i>, and
<i>’Tiser</i>&mdash;pubs. we calls the <i>’Tiser</i>&mdash;all to their
own cheek. It’s penny works I sell the most
of; indeed, it’s very seldom I offer anything
else, ’cause it’s little use. Penny Punches is
fair sale, and I calls it ‘Punch’&mdash;just Punch.
It’s dead now, I believe, but there’s old numbers;
still they’ll be done in time. The real
Punch&mdash;I sell from six to twelve a week&mdash;I
call that there as the reel Punch. Galleries
of Comicalities is a middling sale; people
take them home with them, I think. Guides to
the Thames is good in summer. They’re illustrated;
but people sometimes grumbles and
calls them catchpennies. It ain’t my fault if
they’re not all that’s expected, but people expects
everything for 1<i>d.</i> Joe Millers and ’Stophelees”
(Mephistopheles) “I’ve sold, and said
they was oppositions to Punch; that’s a year or
more back, but they was old, and to be had
cheap. I sell Lloyd’s and Reynolds’s pennies&mdash;fairish,
both of them; so’s the Family Herald
and the London Journal&mdash;very fair. I
don’t venture on any three-halfpenny books on
anything like a spec., acause people says at
once: ‘A penny&mdash;I’ll give you a penny.’ I
sell seven out of eight of what I do sell
to gents.; more than that, perhaps; for you’ll
not often see a woman buy nothing wots intended
to improve her mind. A young woman,
like a maid of all work, buys sometimes
and looks hard at the paper; but I sometimes
thinks it’s to show she can read. A
summer Sunday’s my best time, out and out.
There’s new faces then, and one goes on bolder.
I’ve known young gents. buy, just to offer to
young women, I’m pretty well satisfied. It’s a
introduction. <i>I have</i> met with real gentlemen.
They’ve looked over all I offered for sale and
then said: ‘Nothing I want, my good fellow,
but here’s a penny for your trouble.’ I wish
there was more of them. I do sincerely.
Sometimes I’ve gone on board and not sold one
paper. I buy in the regular way, 9<i>d.</i> for a dozen
(sometimes thirteen to the dozen) of penny
pubs. I don’t know what I make, for I keep
no count; perhaps a sov. in a good week and a
half in another.”</p>

<p>I am informed that the average earnings of
these traders, altogether, may be taken at 15<i>s.</i>
weekly; calculating that twelve carry on the
trade the year through, we find that (assuming
each man to sell at thirty-three per cent. profit&mdash;though
in the case of old works it will be
cent. per cent.) upwards of 1,500<i>l.</i> are expended
annually in steam-boat papers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sale of Newspapers, Books, &amp;c.,
at the Railway Stations.</span></h3>

<p>Although the sale of newspapers at the railway
termini, &amp;c., cannot strictly be classed as
a street-sale, it is so far an open-air traffic as
to require some brief notice, and it has now
become a trade of no small importance.</p>

<p>The privilege of selling to railway-passengers,
within the precincts of the terminus, is disposed
of by tender. At present the newsvendor on the
North-Western Line, I am informed, pays to
the company, for the right of sale at the Euston-square
terminus, and the provincial stations, as
large a sum as 1,700<i>l.</i> per annum. The amount
usually given is of course in proportion to the
number of stations, and the traffic of the railway.</p>

<p>The purchaser of this exclusive privilege
sends his own servants to sell the newspapers and
books, which he supplies to them in the quantity
required. The men thus engaged are paid from
20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a week, and the boys receive from
6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, but rarely 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>All the morning and evening papers are sold
at the Station, but of the weekly press, those are
sent for sale which in the manager’s judgment
are likely to sell, or which his agent informs
him are “asked for.” It is the same with the
weekly unstamped publications. The reason
seems obvious; if there be more than can be
sold, a dead loss is incurred, for the surplusage,
as regards newspapers, is only saleable as waste
paper.</p>

<p>The books sold at railways are nearly all of
the class best known as “light reading,” or
what some account light reading. The price
does not often exceed 1<i>s.</i>; and among the books
offered for sale in these places are novels in
one volume, published at 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;sometimes in two
volumes, at 1<i>s.</i> each; “monthly parts” of works
issued in weekly numbers; shilling books of
poetry; but rarely political or controversial
pamphlets. One man, who understood this
trade, told me that “a few of the pamphlets
about the Pope and Cardinal Wiseman sold at
first; but in a month or six weeks, people began
to say, ‘A shilling for that! I’m sick of the
thing.’”</p>

<p>The large sum given for the privilege of an
exclusive sale, shows that the number of books
and papers sold at railway stations must be very
considerable. But it must be borne in mind,
that the price, and consequently the profit on
the daily newspapers, sold at the railways, is
greater than elsewhere. None are charged less
than 6<i>d.</i>, the regular price at a news-agent’s
shop being 5<i>d.</i>, so that as the cost price is 4<i>d.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the profit is double. Nor is it unusual for a
passenger by an early train, who grows impatient
for his paper, to cry out, “A shilling for
the <i>Times</i>!” This, however, is only the case,
I am told, with those who start very early in
the morning; for the daily papers are obtained
for the railway stations from among the earliest
impressions, and can be had at the accustomed
price as early as six o’clock, although, if there
be exciting news and a great demand, a larger
amount may be given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Booksellers.</span></h3>

<p>The course of my inquiry now leads me to
consider one of the oldest, and certainly not
least important of the street traffics&mdash;that of
the book-stalls. Of these there are now about
twenty in the London streets, but in this
number I include only those which are <i>properly</i>
street-stalls. Many book-stalls, as in such a
locality as the London-road, are appendages to
shops, being merely a display of wares outside
the bookseller’s premises; and with these I do
not now intend to deal.</p>

<p>The men in this trade I found generally to be
intelligent. They have been, for the most part,
engaged in some minor department of the book-selling
or newspaper trade, in the regular way,
and are unconnected with the street-sellers in
other lines, of whose pursuits, habits, and
characters, they seem to know nothing.</p>

<p>The street book-stalls are most frequent in
the thoroughfares which are well-frequented,
but which, as one man in the trade expressed
himself, are not so “shoppy” as others&mdash;such
as the City-road, the New-road, and the Old
Kent-road. “If there’s what you might call
a recess,” observed another street book-stall-keeper,
“<i>that’s</i> the place for us; and you’ll
often see us along with flower-stands and
pinners-up.” The stalls themselves do not
present any very smart appearance; they are
usually of plain deal. If the stock of books
be sufficiently ample, they are disposed on the
surface of the stall, “fronts up,” as I heard it
described, with the titles, when lettered on the
back, like as they are presented in a library. If
the “front” be unlettered, as is often the case
with the older books, a piece of paper is
attached, and on it is inscribed the title and
the price. Sometimes the description is exceeding
curt, as, “Poetry,” “French,” “Religious,”
“Latin” (I saw an odd volume, in
Spanish, of Don Quixote, marked “Latin,” but
it was at a shop-seller’s stall,) “Pamphlets,”
and such like; or where it seems to have been
thought necessary to give a somewhat fuller
appellation, such titles are written out as
“Locke’s Understanding,” “Watts’s Mind,” or
“Pope’s Rape.” If the stock be rather scant,
the side of the book is then shown, and is either
covered with white paper, on which the title
and price are written, or “brushed,” or else a
piece of paper is attached, with the necessary
announcement.</p>

<p>Sometimes these announcements are striking
enough, as where a number of works of the
same size have been bound together (which
used to be the case, I am told, more frequently
than it is now); or where there has been a series
of stories in one volume. One such announcement
was, “Smollett’s Peregrine Pickle Captain
Kyd Pirate Prairie Rob of the Bowl Bamfyeld
Moore Carew 2<i>s.</i>” Alongside this miscellaneous
volume was, “Wilberforce’s Practical
View of Christianity, 1<i>s.</i>;” “Fenelon’s Aventures
de Télémaque, plates, 9<i>d.</i>;” “Arres, de
Predestinatione, 1<i>s.</i>” (the last-mentioned work,
which, at the first glance, seems as if it were
an odd mixture of French and Latin, was a
Latin quarto); “Coronis ad Collationem Hagiensem,
&amp;c. &amp;c., Gulielmo Amesio.” Another
work, on another stall, had the following description:
“Lord Mount Edgecumbe’s Opera
What is Currency Watts’s Scripture History
Thoughts on Taxation only 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>” Another
was, “Knickerbocker Bacon 1<i>s.</i>” As a rule,
however, the correctness with which the work
is described is rather remarkable.</p>

<p>At some few of the street-stalls, and at many
of the shop-stalls, are boxes, containing works
marked, “All 1<i>d.</i>,” or 2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, or 4<i>d.</i> Among
these are old Court-Guides, Parliamentary Companions,
Railway Plans, and a variety of sermons,
and theological, as well as educational
and political pamphlets. To show the character
of the publications thus offered&mdash;not, perhaps,
as a rule, but generally enough, for sale&mdash;I
copied down the titles of some at 1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“<i>All these at 1d.</i>&mdash;‘Letters to the Right
Honourable Lord John Russell, on State Education,
by Edward Baines, jun.;’ ‘A Pastoral
Letter to the Clergy and Members of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in the United States
of America;’ ‘A Letter to the Protestant Dissenters
of England and Wales, by the Rev.
Robert Ainslie;’ ‘Friendly Advice to Conservatives;’
‘Elementary Thoughts on the
Principles of Currency and Wealth, and on
the Means of Diminishing the Burthens of
the People, by J. D. Basset, Esq., price 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’”
The others were each published at 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“<i>All these at 2d.</i>&mdash;‘Poems, by Eleanor Tatlock,
1811, 2 vols., 9<i>s.</i>;’ ‘Two Sermons, on the
Fall and Final Restoration of the Jews, by the
Rev. John Stuart;’ ‘Thoughts and Feelings,
by Arthur Brooke, 1820;’ ‘The Amours of
Philander and Sylvia, being the third and last
part of Love-letters between a Nobleman and
his Sister. Volume the Second. The Seventh
Edition. London.’”</p>

<p>From a cursory examination of the last-mentioned
twopenny volume, I could see nothing of
the nobleman or his sister. It is one of an inane
class of books, originated, I believe, in the latter
part of the reign of Charles II. Such publications
professed to be (and some few were) records
of the court and city scandal of the day, but in
general they were works founded on the reputation
of the current scandal. In short, to adopt
the language of patterers, they were “cocks”
issued by the publishers of that period; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
they continued to be published until the middle
of the eighteenth century, or a little later. I
notice this description of literature the more,
particularly as it is still frequently to be met
with in street-sale. “There’s oft enough,” one
street-bookseller said to me, “works of that sort
making up a ‘lot’ at a sale, and in very respectable
rooms. As if they were make-weights, or
to make up a sufficient number of books, and so
they keep their hold in the streets.”</p>

<p>As many of my readers may have little, if
any, knowledge of this class of street-sold works,
I cite a portion of the “epistle dedicatory,”
and a specimen of the style, of “Philander and
Sylvia,” to show the change in street, as well
as in general literature, as no such works are
now published:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the Lord Spencer, My Lord, when a new book
comes into the world, the first thing we consider is
the dedication; and according to the quality and
humour of the patron, we are apt to make a judgment
of the following subject. If to a statesman we
believe it grave and politic; if to a gownman, law or
divinity; if to the young and gay, love and gallantry.
By this rule, I believe the gentle reader, who finds
your lordship’s name prefixed before this, will make
as many various opinions of it, as they do characters
of your lordship, whose youthful sallies have been the
business of so much discourse; and which, according
to the relator’s sense or good nature, is either aggravated
or excused; though the woman’s quarrel to
your lordship has some more reasonable foundation,
than that of your own sex; for your lordship being
formed with all the beauties and graces of mankind,
all the charms of wit, youth, and sweetness of disposition
(derived to you from an illustrious race of
heroes) adapting you to the noblest love and softness,
they cannot but complain on that mistaken conduct
of yours, that so lavishly deals out those agreeable
attractions, squandering away that youth and time
on many, which might be more advantageously dedicated
to some one of the fair; and by a liberty (which
they call not being discreet enough) rob them of all
the hopes of conquest over that heart which they
believe can fix no where; they cannot caress you into
tameness; or if you sometimes appear so, they are
still upon their guard with you; for like a young lion
you are ever apt to leap into your natural wildness;
the greatness of your soul disdaining to be confined
to lazy repose; though the delicacy of your person
and constitution so absolutely require it; your lordship
not being made for diversions so rough and
fatiguing, as those your active mind would impose
upon it.”</p></div>

<p>The last sentence is very long, so that a
shorter extract may serve as a specimen of the
staple of this book-making:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To Philander,&mdash;False and perjured as you are, I
languish for a sight of you, and conjure you to give it
me as soon as this comes to your hands. Imagine
not that I have prepared those instruments of
revenge that are so justly due to your perfidy; but
rather, that I have yet too tender sentiments for you,
in spite of the outrage you have done my heart; and
that for all the ruin you have made, I still adore you;
and though I know you are now another’s slave, yet I
beg you would vouchsafe to behold the spoils you
have made, and allow me this recompense for all,
to say&mdash;Here was the beauty I once esteemed, though
now she is no more Philander’s Sylvia.”</p></div>

<p>Having thus described what may be considered
the divisional parts of this stall trade, I
proceed to the more general character of the
class of books sold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Character of Books of the
Street-sale.</span></h3>

<p>There has been a change, and in some respects
a considerable change, in the character
or class of books sold at the street-stalls, within
the last 40 or 50 years, as I have ascertained
from the most experienced men in the trade.
Now sermons, or rather the works of the old
divines, are rarely seen at these stalls, or if
seen, are rarely purchased. Black-letter editions
are very unfrequent at street book-stalls,
and it is twenty times more difficult, I am
assured, for street-sellers to pick up anything
really rare and curious, than it was in the early
part of the century.</p>

<p>One reason assigned for this change by an
intelligent street-seller was, that black-letter or
any ancient works, were almost all purchased
by the second-hand booksellers, who have shops
and issue catalogues, as they had a prompt sale
for them whenever they could pick them up
at book-auctions or elsewhere. “Ay, indeed,”
said another book-stall keeper, “anything scarce
or curious, when it’s an old book, is kept out of
the streets; if it’s not particular decent, sir,”
(with a grin), “why it’s reckoned all the more
curious,&mdash;that’s the word, sir, I know,&mdash;‘curious.’
I can tell how many beans make
five as well as you or anybody. Why, now,
there’s a second-hand bookseller not a hundred
miles from Holborn&mdash;and a pleasant, nice
man he is, and does a respectable business&mdash;and
he puts to the end of his catalogue&mdash;they
all have catalogues that’s in a good way&mdash;two
pages that he calls ‘Facetiæ.’ They’re titles
and prices of queer old books in all languages&mdash;indecent
books, indeed. He sends his catalogues
to a many clergymen and learned people; and
to any that he thinks wouldn’t much admire
seeing his ‘Facetiæ,’ he pulls the last leaf out,
and sends his catalogue, looking finished without
it. Those last two pages aren’t at all the worst
part of his trade among buyers that’s worth
money.”</p>

<p>In one respect a characteristic of this trade
is unaltered; I allude to the prevalence of
“odd volumes” at the cheaper stalls,&mdash;not the
odd volumes of a novel, but more frequently of
one of the essayists&mdash;the “Spectator” especially.
One stall-keeper told me, that if he purchased
an old edition of the “Spectator,” in eight vols.,
he could more readily sell it in single volumes,
at 4<i>d.</i> each, than sell the eight vols. altogether
for 2<i>s.</i>, or even 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, though this was but 2<i>d.</i>
a volume.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing in my trade,” said one
street-bookseller with whom I conversed on the
subject, “that sells better, or indeed so well, as
English classics. I can’t offer to draw fine
distinctions, and I’m just speaking of my own
plain way of trade; but <i>I</i> call English classics
such works as the ‘Spectator,’ ‘Tatler,’
‘Guardian,’ ‘Adventurer,’ ‘Rambler,’ ‘Rasselas,’
‘The Vicar of Wakefield,’ ‘Peregrine
Pickle,’ ‘Tom Jones,’ ‘Goldsmith’s His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>tories
of Greece, Rome, and England’ (they
all sell quick), ‘Enfield’s Speaker,’ ‘mixed
plays,’ the ‘Sentimental Journey,’ no, sir,
‘Tristram Shandy,’ rather hangs on hand, the
‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ (but it must be sold <i>very</i>
low), ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ ‘Philip Quarles,’
‘Telemachus,’ ‘Gil Blas,’ and ‘Junius’s Letters.’
I don’t remember more at this moment, such
as are of good sale. I haven’t included poetry,
because I’m speaking of English classics, and
of course they must be oldish works to be
classics.”</p>

<p>Concerning the street sale of poetical works
I learned from street book-sellers, that their
<i>readiest</i> sale was of volumes of Shakespeare,
Pope, Thomson, Goldsmith, Cowper, Burns,
Byron, and Scott. “You must recollect, sir,”
said one dealer, “that in nearly all those poets
there’s a double chance for sale at book-stalls.
For what with old editions, and new and cheap
editions, there’s always plenty in the market,
and very low. No, I can’t say I could sell
Milton as quickly as any of those mentioned,
nor ‘Hudibras,’ nor ‘Young’s Night Thoughts,’
nor Prior, nor Dryden, nor ‘Gay’s Fables.’
It’s seldom that we have any works of Hood,
or Shelley, or Coleridge, or Wordsworth, or
Moore at street stalls&mdash;you don’t often see them,
I think, at booksellers’ stalls&mdash;for they’re soon
picked up. Poetry sells very fair, take it
altogether.”</p>

<p>Another dealer told me that from twenty to
thirty years ago there were at the street-stalls
a class of works rarely seen now. He had
known them in all parts and had disposed of
them in his own way of business. He specified
the “Messiah” (Klopstock’s) as of this class,
the “Death of Abel,” the “Castle of Otranto”
(“but that’s seen occasionally still,” he observed),
the “Old English Baron” (“and that’s
seen still too, but nothing to what it were once”),
the “Young Man’s Best Companion,” “Zimmerman
on Solitude,” and “Burke on the Sublime
and Beautiful” (“but I have that yet
sometimes.”) These works were of heavy sale
in the streets, and my informant thought they
had been thrown into the street-trade because
the publishers had not found them saleable in
the regular way. “I was dead sick of the
‘Death of Abel,’” observed the man, “before
I could get out of him.” Occasionally are to
be seen at most of the stalls, works of which
the majority of readers have heard, but may not
have met with. Among such I saw “Laura,”
by Capel Lloftt, 4 vols. 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> “Darwin’s
Botanic Garden,” 2<i>s.</i> “Alfred, an Epic Poem,”
by H. J. Pye, Poet Laureate, 10<i>d.</i> “Cœlebs
in search of a Wife,” 2 vols. in one, 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The same informant told me that he had
lived near an old man who died twenty-five
years ago, or it might be more, with whom he
was somewhat intimate. This old man had
been all his life familiar with the street trade
in books, which he had often hawked&mdash;a trade
now almost unknown; his neighbour had heard
him say that fifty to seventy years ago, he
made his two guineas a week “without distressing
hisself,” meaning, I was told, that he
was drinking every Monday at least. This
old man used to tell that in his day, the
“Whole Duty of Man,” and the “Tale of a
Tub,” and “Pomfret’s Poems,” and “Pamela,”
and “Sir Charles Grandison” went off <i>well</i>, but
“Pamela” the best. “And I’ve heard the old
man say, sir,” I was further told, “how he
had to tread his shoes straight about what books
he showed publicly. He sold ‘Tom Paine’ on
the sly. If anybody bought a book and would
pay a good price for it, three times as much as
was marked, he’d <i>give</i> the ‘Age of Reason’ in.
I never see it now, but I don’t suppose anybody
would interfere if it was offered. A sly
trade’s always the best for paying, and for
selling too. The old fellow used to laugh and
say his stall was quite a godly stall, and he
wasn’t often without a copy or two of the
‘Anti-Jacobin Review,’ which was all for Church
and State and all that, though he had ‘Tom
Paine’ in a drawer.”</p>

<p>The books sold at the street-stalls are purchased
by the retailers either at the auctions
of the regular trade, or at “chance,” or general
auctions, or of the Jews or others who may
have bought books cheap under such circumstances.
Often, however, the stall-keeper
has a market peculiarly his own. It is not
uncommon for working men or tradesmen, if
they become “beaten-down and poor” to carry
a basket-full of books to a stall-keeper, and
say, “Here, give me half-a-crown for these.”
One man had forty parts, each issued at 1<i>s.</i>,
of a Bible, offered to him at 1<i>d.</i> a part, by a
mechanic who could not any longer afford to
“take them in,” and was at last obliged to
sell off what he had. Of course such things
are nearly valueless when imperfect. Very few
works are bought for street-stall sale of the
regular booksellers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Experience of a Street Book-seller.</span></h3>

<p>I now give a statement, furnished to me by an
experienced man, as to the nature of his trade,
and the class of his customers. Most readers
will remember having seen an account in the
life of some poor scholar, having read&mdash;and occasionally,
in spite of the remonstrances of
the stall-keeper&mdash;some work which he was too
needy to purchase, and even of his having read
it through at intervals. That something of this
kind is still to be met with will be found from
the following account:</p>

<p>“My customers, sir, are of all sorts,” my
informant said. “They’re gentlemen on their
way from the City, that have to pass along
here by the City-road. Bankers’ clerks, very
likely, or insurance-office clerks, or such like.
They’re fairish customers, but they often screw
me. Why only last month a gentleman I know
very well by sight, and I see him pass in his
brougham in bad weather, took up an old Latin
book&mdash;if I remember right it was an odd volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of a French edition of Horace&mdash;and though it
was marked only 8<i>d.</i>, it was long before he
would consent to give more than 6<i>d.</i> And I
should never have got my price if I hadn’t heard
him say quite hastily, when he took up the book,
‘The very thing I’ve long been looking for!’
Mechanics are capital customers for scientific or
trade books, such as suit their business; and so
they often are for geography and history, and
some for poetry; but <i>they’re</i> not so screwy. I
know a many such who are rare ones for searching
into knowledge. Women buy very little of
me in comparison to men; sometimes an odd
novel, in one volume, when its cheap, such as
‘The Pilot,’ or ‘The Spy,’ or ‘The Farmer of
Inglewood Forest,’ or ‘The Monk.’ No doubt
some buy ‘The Monk,’ not knowing exactly what
sort of a book it is, but just because it’s a romance;
but some young men buy it, I know,
because they have learned what sort it’s like.
Old three vol. novels won’t sell at all, if they’re
ever so cheap. Boys very seldom buy of me,
unless it’s a work about pigeons, or something
that way.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that odd vols. of Annual Registers
are anything but a bad sale, but odd vols.
of old Mags. (magazines), a year or half-year
bound together, are capital. Old London Mags.,
or Ladies’, or Oxford and Cambridges, or Town
and Countrys, or Universals, or Monthly Reviews,
or Humourists, or Ramblers, or Europeans,
or any of any sort, that’s from 40 to 100
years old, no matter what they are, go off rapidly
at from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, according to size,
and binding, and condition. Odd numbers of
Mags. are good for little at a stall. The old Mags.
in vols. are a sort of reading a great many
are very fond of. Lives of the Princess Charlotte
are a ready penny enough. So are Queen
Carolines, but not so good. Dictionaries of all
kinds are nearly as selling as the old Mags.,
and so are good Latin books. French are only
middling; not so well as you might think.”</p>

<p>My informant then gave me a similar account
to what I had previously received concerning
English classics, and proceeded: “Old religious
books, they’re a fair trade enough, but they’re
not so plentiful on the stalls now, and if they’re
black-letter they don’t find their way from the
auctions or anywhere to any places but the shops
or to private purchasers. Mrs. Rowe’s ‘Knowledge
of the Heart’ goes off, if old. Bibles, and
Prayer-books, and Hymn-books, are very bad.”
[This may be accounted for by the cheapness
of these publications, when new, and by the
facilities afforded to obtain them gratuitously.]
“Annuals are dull in going off; very much so,
though one might expect different. I can hardly
sell ‘Keepsakes’ at all. Children’s books, such
as are out one year at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> apiece, very nicely
got up, sell finely next year at the stalls for
from 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i> Genteel people buy them of
us for presents at holiday times. They’ll give
an extra penny quite cheerfully if there’s ‘Price
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’ or ‘Price 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’ lettered on the back
or part of the title-page. School-books in good
condition don’t stay long on hand, especially
Pinnock’s. There’s not a few people who
stand and read and read for half an hour or
an hour at a time. It’s very trying to the
temper when they take up room that way, and
prevent others seeing the works, and never lay
out a penny theirselves. But they seem quite
lost in a book. Well, I’m sure I don’t know
what they are. Some seem very poor, judging
by their dress, and some seem shabby genteels.
I can’t help telling them, when I see them
going, that I’m much obliged, and I hope that
perhaps next time they’ll manage to say ‘thank
ye,’ for they don’t open their lips once in twenty
times. I know a man in the trade that goes
dancing mad when he has customers of this
sort, who aren’t customers. I dare say, one day
with another, I earn 3<i>s.</i> the year through; wet
days are greatly against us, for if we have a
cover people won’t stop to look at a stall. Perhaps
the rest of my trade earn the same.” This
man told me that he was not unfrequently asked,
and by respectable people, for indecent works,
but he recommended them to go to Holywell-street
themselves. He believed that some of
his fellow-traders <i>did</i> supply such works, but
to no great extent.</p>

<p>An elderly man, who had known the street
book-trade for many years, but was not concerned
in it when I saw him, told me that he
was satisfied he had sold old books, old plays
often, to Charles Lamb, whom he described as
a stuttering man, who, when a book suited him,
sometimes laid down the price, and smiled and
nodded, and then walked away with it in his
pocket or under his arm, without a word having
been exchanged. When we came to speak of
dates, I found that my informant&mdash;who had only
conjectured that this was Lamb&mdash;was unquestionably
mistaken. One of the best customers
he ever had for anything old or curious, and in
Italian, if he remembered rightly, as well as
in English, was the late Rev. Mr. Scott, who
was chaplain on board the Victory, at the time
of Nelson’s death at Trafalgar. “He had a
living in Yorkshire, I believe it was,” said the
man, “and used to come up every now and then
to town. I was always glad to see his white
head and rosy face, and to have a little talk with
him about books and trade, though it wasn’t
always easy to catch what he said, for he spoke
quick, and not very distinct. But he was a
pleasant old gentleman, and talked to a poor
man as politely as he might to an admiral. He
was very well known in my trade, as I was then
employed.”</p>

<p>The same man once sold to a gentleman, he
told me, and he believed it was somewhere about
twenty-five years ago, if not more, a Spanish or
Portuguese work, but what it was he did not
know. It was marked 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, being a good-sized
book, but the stall-keeper was tired of
having had it a long time, so that he gladly
would have taken 9<i>d.</i> for it. The gentleman in
question handed him half-a-crown, and, as he
had not the change, the purchaser said: “O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
don’t mind; it’s worth far more than half-a-crown
to me.” When this liberal customer had
walked away, a gentleman who had been standing
at the stall all the time, and who was an
occasional buyer, said, “Do you know him?”
and, on receiving an answer in the negative, he
rejoined, “That’s Southey.”</p>

<p>Another stall-keeper told me that his customers&mdash;some
of whom he supplied with any
periodical in the same way as a newsvendor&mdash;had
now and then asked him, especially “the
ladies of the family,” who glanced, when they
passed, at the contents of his stall, why he had
not newer works? “I tell them,” said the
stall-keeper, “that they haven’t become cheap
enough yet for the streets, but that they would
come to it in time.” After some conversation
about his trade, which only confirmed the statements
I have given, he said laughingly, “Yes,
indeed, you all come to such as me at last.
Why, last night I heard a song about all the
stateliest buildings coming to the ivy, and I
thought, as I listened, it was the same with
authors. The best that the best can do is the
book-stall’s food at last. And no harm, for he’s
in the best of company, with Shakespeare, and
all the great people.”</p>

<p>Calculating 15<i>s.</i> weekly as the average earnings
of the street book-stall keepers&mdash;for further
information induces me to think that the street
bookseller who earned 18<i>s.</i> a week regularly,
cleared it by having a “tidy pitch”&mdash;and reckoning
that, to clear such an amount, the bookseller
takes, at least, 1<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, we find
5,460 guineas yearly expended in the purchase
of books at the purely street-stalls, independently
of what is laid out at the open-air stalls
connected with book-shops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Street Book-auctioneers.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of books by auction, in the streets, is
now inconsiderable and irregular. The “auctioning”
of books&mdash;I mean of new books&mdash;some
of which were published principally with a view
to their sale by auction, was, thirty to forty
years ago, systematic and extensive. It was not
strictly a street-sale. The auctioneer offered his
books to the public, nine cases out of ten, in
town, in an apartment (now commonly known
as a “mock-auction room”), which was so far
a portion of the street that access was rendered
easier by the removal of the door and window of
any room on a ground-floor, and some of the
bidders could and did stand in the street and
take part in the proceedings. In the suburbs&mdash;which
at that period were not so integral a portion
of the metropolis as at present&mdash;the book-auction
sales were carried on strictly in the open air, generally
in front of a public-house, and either on a
platform erected for the purpose, or from a covered
cart; the books then being deposited in
the vehicle, and the auctioneer standing on a
sort of stage placed on the propped-up shafts.
In the country, however, the auction was often
carried on in an inn.</p>

<p>The works thus sold were generally standard
works. The poems were those of Pope, Young,
Thomson, Goldsmith, Falconer, Cowper, &amp;c.
The prose writings were such works as “The
Pilgrim’s Progress,” “The Travels of Mr.
Lemuel Gulliver,” “Johnson’s Lives of the
Poets,” “The Vicar of Wakefield,” the most
popular of the works of Defoe, Fielding, and
Smollett, and “Hervey’s Meditations among the
Tombs” (at one time highly popular). These
books were not correctly printed, they were
printed, too, on inferior paper, and the frontispiece&mdash;when
there <i>was</i> a frontispiece&mdash;was often
ridiculous. But they certainly gave to the public
what is called an “impetus” for reading.
Some were published in London (chiefly by the
late Mr. Tegg, who at one time, I am told, himself
“offered to public competition,” by auction,
the works he published); others were printed in
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Ipswich, Bungay, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of my informants remembered being
present at a street-sale, about twenty or thirty
years ago; he perfectly remembered, however,
the oratory of the auctioneer, of whom he purchased
some books. The sale was in one of the
streets in Stoke Newington, a door or two from
a thoroughfare. My informant was there&mdash;as
he called it&mdash;“accidentally,” and knew little of
the neighbourhood. The auctioneer stood at
the door of what appeared to have been a coach-house,
and sold his books, which were arranged
within, very rapidly: “Byron,” he exclaimed;
“Lord Byron’s latest and best po’ms. Sixpence!
Sixpence! Eightpence! I take penny bids
under a shilling. Eightpence for the poems
written by a lord&mdash;Gone! Yours, sir” (to my
informant). The auctioneer, I was told, “spoke
very rapidly, and clipped many of his words.”
The work thus sold consisted of some of Byron’s
minor poems. It was in the pamphlet form, and
published, I have no doubt, surreptitiously; for
there was, in those days, a bold and frequent
piracy of any work which was thought distasteful
to the Government, or to which the Court of
Chancery might be likely to refuse the protection
of the law of copyright.</p>

<p>The auctioneer went on: “Coop’r&mdash;Coop’r!
Published at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, as printed on the back.
Superior to Byron&mdash;Coop’r’s ‘Task.’ No
bidders? Thank you, sir. One-and-six,&mdash;your’s,
sir. Young&mdash;‘Young’s Night Thoughts.
Life, Death, and Immortality,’&mdash;great subjects.
London edition, marked 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Going!&mdash;last
bidder&mdash;two shillings&mdash;gone!” The purchaser
then complained that the frontispiece&mdash;a man
seated on a tombstone&mdash;was exactly the same as
to a copy he had of “Hervey’s Meditations,”
but the auctioneer said it was impossible.</p>

<p>I have thus shown what <i>was</i> the style and
nature of the address of the street book-auctioneer,
formerly, to the public. If it were not
strictly “patter,” or “pompous oration,” it certainly
partook of some of the characteristics of
patter. At present, however, the street book-auctioneer
may be described as a true patterer.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the account I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
given, that the books were then really “sold
by auction”&mdash;knocked down to the highest
bidder. This however was, and is not always
the case. Legally to sell by auction, necessitates
the obtaining of a licence, at an annual
cost of 5<i>l.</i>; and if the bookseller conveys
his stock of books from place to place, a
hawker’s licence is required as well,&mdash;which
entails an additional expenditure of 4<i>l.</i> The
itinerant bookseller evades, or endeavours to
evade, the payment for an auctioneer’s licence,
by “putting-up” his books at a high price,
and <i>himself</i> decreasing the terms, instead of
offering them at a low price, and allowing <i>the
public</i> to make a series of “advances.” Thus,
a book may be offered by a street-auctioneer at
half-a-crown&mdash;two shillings&mdash;eighteenpence&mdash;a
shilling&mdash;tenpence, and the moment any one
assents to a specified sum, the volume handed
to him; so that there is no competition&mdash;no
bidding by the public one in advance of another.
Auction, however, is resorted to as often
as the bookseller dares.</p>

<p>One experienced man in the book-stall trade
calculated that twenty years ago there might
be twelve book-auctioneers in the streets of
London, or rather, of its suburbs. One of
these was a frequenter of the Old Kent-road;
another, “Newington way;” and a third resorted
to “any likely pitch in Pimlico”&mdash;all
selling from a sort of van. Of these twelve,
however, my informant thought that there were
never more than six in London at one time, as
they were all itinerant; and they have gradually
dwindled down to two, who are now not half
their time in town. These two traders are
brothers, and sell their books from a sort of
platform erected on a piece of waste-ground, or
from a barrow. The works they sell are generally
announced as new, and are often uncut.
They are all recommended as explanatory of
every topic of the day, and are often set forth
as “spicy.” Three or four years ago, a gentleman
told me how greatly he was amused with
the patter of one of these men, who was selling
books at the entrance of a yard full of caravans,
not far from the School for the Blind, Lambeth.
One work the street-auctioneer announced at
the top of his voice, in the following terms, as
far as a good memory could retain them: “‘The
Rambler!’ Now you rambling boys&mdash;now you
young devils, that’s been staring those pretty
girls out of countenance&mdash;here’s the very book
for you, and more shame for you, and perhaps
for me too; but I must sell&mdash;I must do business.
If any lady or gen’lman’ll stand treat
to a glass of brandy and water, ‘warm with,’
I’ll tell more about this ‘Rambler’&mdash;I’m too
bashful, as it is. Who bids? Fifteen-pence&mdash;thank’ee,
sir. Sold again!” The “Rambler”
was Dr. Johnson’s!</p>

<p>The last time one of my informants heard
the “patter” of the smartest of the two brothers,
it was to the following effect: “Here is
the ‘History of the Real Flying Dutchman,’
and <i>no</i> mistake; no fiction, I assure you, upon
my honour. Published at 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;who bids half-a-crown?
Sixpence; thank you, sir. Ninepence;
going&mdash;going! Any more?&mdash;gone!”</p>

<p>A book-stall-keeper, who had sold goods to a
book-auctioneer, and attended the sales, told
me he was astonished to hear how his own
books&mdash;“old new books,” he called them, were
set off by the auctioneer: “Why, there was a
vol. lettered ‘Pamphlets,’ and I think there <i>was</i>
something about Jack Sheppard in it, but it
was all odds and ends of other things, I know.
‘Here’s the <i>real</i> Jack Sheppard,’ sings out the
man, ‘and no gammon!’ The real edition&mdash;no
spooniness here, but set off with other interesting
histories, valuable for the rising generation and
all generations. This is the real Jack. This
will</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent2">‘&mdash;&mdash;put you up to the time o’ day,</div>
       <div class="verse">Nix, my dolly pals, <i>bid</i> away.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Then he went on: ‘Goldsmith’s History of
England. Continued by the first writers of the
day&mdash;to the very last rumpus in the palace, and
no mistake. Here it is; genuine.’ Well, sir,”
the stall-keeper continued, “the man didn’t
do well; perhaps he cleared 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or a little
more that evening on books. People laughed
more than they bought. But it’s no wonder
the trade’s going to the dogs&mdash;they’re not
allowed to have a pitch now; I shouldn’t be
surprised if they was not <i>all</i> driven out of
London next year. It’s contrary to Act of
Parliament to get an honest living in the streets
now-a-days.”</p>

<p>A man connected with the street book-trade
considered that if one of these auctioneers
earned a guinea in London streets in the six
days it was a “good week.” Half-a-guinea
was nearer the average, he thought, “looking
at the weather and everything.” What amount
is expended to enable this street-dealer to earn
his guinea or half-guinea, is so uncertain, from
the very nature of an auction, that I can obtain
no data to rely upon.</p>

<p>The itinerant book-auctioneer is now confined
chiefly to the provincial towns, and especially
the country markets. The reason for
this is correctly given in the statement above
cited. The street-auction requires the gathering
of so large a crowd that the metropolitan
police consider the obstruction to the public
thoroughfares warrants their interference. The
two remaining book-auctioneers in London
generally restrict their operations to the outskirts&mdash;the
small space which fronts “the
George Inn” in the Commercial-road, and
which lays a few yards behind the main
thoroughfare, and similar suburban “retreats”
being favourite “pitches.” The trade is, as
regards profits, far from bad&mdash;the books sold
consisting chiefly of those picked up in cheap
“lots” at the regular auctions; so that what
fetches 6<i>d.</i> in the streets has generally been
purchased for less than a penny. The average
rate of profit may be taken at 250<i>l.</i> per cent.
at the least. Exorbitant however as this return
may appear, still it should be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that the avocation is one that can be pursued
only occasionally, and that solely in fine weather.
Books are now more frequently sold in
the London streets from barrows. This change
of traffic has been forced upon the street-sellers
by the commands of the police&mdash;that
the men should “keep moving.” Hence the
well-known light form of street conveyance is
now fast superseding not only the book-auctioneer,
but the book-stall in the London
streets. Of these book-barrowmen there is now
about fifty trading regularly in the metropolis,
and taking on an average from 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sale of Song-books, and
of Children’s Books.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of song-books in the streets, at 1<i>d.</i> and
at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, is smaller than it was two years ago.
One reason that I heard assigned was that the
penny song-books&mdash;styled “The Universal Song-book,”
“The National,” “The Bijou,” &amp;c.&mdash;were
reputed to be so much alike (the same
songs under a different title), that people who
had bought one book were averse to buy another.
“There’s the ‘Ross’ and the ‘Sam Hall’ song-books,”
said one man, “the ‘eighteenth series,’
and I don’t know what; but I don’t like to venture
on working them, though they’re only a
penny. There’s lots to be seen in the shop-windows;
but they might be stopped in the
street, for they an’t decent&mdash;’specially the flash
ones.”</p>

<p>One of the books which a poor man had found
the most saleable is entitled, “The Great Exhibition
Song-book; a Collection of the Newest
and Most Admired Songs. Embellished with
upwards of one Hundred Toasts and Sentiments.”
The toasts and sentiments are given in small
type, as a sort of border to the thirty-two pages
of which the book consists. The toast on the
title-page is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“I’ll toast England’s daughters, let all fill their glasses,</div>
       <div class="verse">Whose beauty and virtue the whole world surpasses.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To show the nature of the songs in street demand,
I cite those in the book: “The Gathering
of the Nations,” “Bloom is on the Rye,”
“Wilt thou Meet me there, Love?” “Minna’s
Tomb,” “I’ll Love thee ever Dearly” (Arnold),
“When Phœbus wakes the Rosy Hours,” “Money
is your Friend,” “Julia and Caspar” (G.
M. Lewis), “That pretty word, Yes” (E.
Mackey), “Farewell, Forget me Not,” “The
Queen and the Navy” (music published by H.
White, Great Marlborough-street), “I resign
Thee every Token” (music published by Duff
and Co.), “Sleep, gentle Lady;” a serenade (H.
J. Payne), “The Warbling Waggoner,” “The
Keepsake,” “A Sequel to the Cavalier,”
“There’s room enough for All” (music at Mr.
Davidson’s), “Will you Come to the Dale?”
“Larry O’Brian,” “Woman’s Love,” “Afloat
on the Ocean” (sung by Mr. Weiss, in the Opera
of the “Heart of Mid Lothian,” music published
by Jefferys, Soho-square), “Together, Dearest,
let us Fly” (sung by Mr. Braham, in the Opera
of the “Heart of Mid Lothian,” music published
by Jefferys, Soho-square), “The Peremptory
Lover” (Tune&mdash;“John Anderson, my Joe”).
There are forty-seven songs in addition to those
whose titles I have quoted, but they are all of
the same character.</p>

<p>The penny song-books (which are partly indecent),
and entitled the “Sam Hall” and
“Ross” Songsters, are seldom or never sold in
the streets. Many of those vended in the shops
outrage all decency. Some of these are styled
the “Coal-Hole Companion,” “Cider-Cellar
Songs,” “Captain Morris’s Songs,” &amp;c. (the
filthiest of all.) These are generally marked
1<i>s.</i> and sold at 6<i>d.</i>; and have a coloured folded
frontispiece. They are published chiefly by H.
Smith, Holywell-street. The titles of some of
the songs in these works are sufficient to indicate
their character. “The Muff,” “The Two
Miss Thys,” “George Robins’s Auction,”
“The Woman that studied the Stars,” “A
Rummy Chaunt” (frequently with no other
title), “The Amiable Family,” “Joe Buggins’
Wedding,” “Stop the Cart,” “The Mot that can
feel for another,” “The Irish Giant,” “Taylor
Tim,” “The Squire and Patty.”</p>

<p>Some titles are unprintable.</p>

<p>The children’s books in best demand in the
street-trade, are those which have long been
popular: “Cinderella,” “Jack the Giant-killer,”
“Baron Munchausen,” “Puss and
the Seven-leagued Boots,” “The Sleeping
Beauty,” “The Seven Champions of Christendom,”
&amp;c. &amp;c. “There’s plenty of ‘Henry
and Emmas,’” said a penny bookseller, “and
‘A Present for Christmas,’ and ‘Pictorial
Alphabets,’ and ‘Good Books for Good Boys
and Girls;’ but when people buys really for
their children, they buys the old stories&mdash;at
least they does of me. I’ve sold ‘Penny
Hymns’ (hymn-books) sometimes; but when
they’re bought, or ‘Good Books’ is bought,
it’s from charity to a poor fellow like me, more
than anything else.”</p>

<p>The trade, both in songs and in children’s
books, is carried on in much the same way as I
have described of the almanacks and memorandum-books,
but occasionally the singers of
ballads sell books. Sometimes poor men, old
or infirm, offer them in a tone which seems
a whine for charity rather than an offer for
sale, “Buy a penny book of a poor old man&mdash;very
hungry, very hungry.” Children do the
same, and all far more frequently in the
suburbs than in the busy parts of the metropolis.
Those who purchase really for the sake of
the books, say, one street-seller told me, “Give
me something that’ll interest a child, and set
him a-thinking. They can’t understand&mdash;poor
little things!&mdash;your fine writing; do you understand
that?” Another man had said, “Fairy
tales! bring me nothing but fairies; they set
children a-reading.” The price asked is most
frequently a penny, but some are offered at a
halfpenny, which is often given (without a purchase)
out of compassion, or to be rid of importunity.
The profit is at least cent. per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Account-books.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of account-books is in the hands of
about the same class of street-sellers as the
stationery, but one man in the trade thought
the regular hands were more trusted, if anything,
than street-stationers. “People, you
see,” he said, “won’t buy their ‘accounts’ of
<i>raff</i>; they won’t have them of any but respectable
people.” The books sold are bought at 4<i>s.</i>
the dozen, or 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> a piece, up to 70<i>s.</i> the dozen,
or 5<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, or 6<i>s.</i> a piece. It is rarely, however,
that the street account-bookseller gives 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>,
and very rarely that he gives as much as 5<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
for his account-books. His principal sale is
of the smaller “waste,” or “day-books,” kept
by the petty traders; the average price of these
being 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> The principal purchasers are the
chandlers, butchers, &amp;c., in the quieter streets,
and more especially “a little way out of town,
where there ain’t so many cheap shops.” A
man, now a street-stationer, with a “fixed
pitch,” had carried on the account-book trade
until an asthmatic affliction compelled him to
relinquish it, as the walking became impossible
to him, and he told me that the street-trade
was nothing to what it once was. “People,”
he said, “aren’t so well off, I think, sir; and
they’ll buy half a quire of outside foolscap, or
outside post, for from 5<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i>, and stitch it
together, and rule it, and make a book of it.
Rich tradesmen do that, sir. I bought of a stationer
some years back, and he told me that
he was a relation of a rich grocer, and had
befriended him in his (the grocer’s) youth, but
he wouldn’t buy account-books, for he said, the
make-shift books that his shopman stitched
together for him opened so much easier. People
never want a good excuse for acting shabby.”</p>

<p>There are now, I am informed, twelve men
selling account-books daily, which they carry in
a covered basket, or in a waterproof bag, or, in
fine weather, under the arm. Some of these
street-sellers are not itinerant when there is a
congregation of people for business, or indeed
for any purpose; at other times they “keep
moving.” The fixed localities are, on market
days, at Smithfield and Mark-lane: and to
Hungerford-market, an old man, unable to
“travel,” resorts daily. The chief trade, however,
is in carrying, or hawking these account-books
from door to door. A man, “having a
connection,” does best “on a round;” if he be
known, he is not distrusted, and sells as cheap,
or rather cheaper, than the shop-keepers.</p>

<p>The twelve account-book sellers (with connections)
may clear 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day each, taking,
for the realisation of such profit, 7<i>s.</i> per diem.
Thus 1,310<i>l.</i> will be taken by these street-sellers
in the course of a year. The capital
required to start is, stock-money, 15<i>s.</i>; basket,
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; waterproof bag, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 21<i>s.</i> in all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Guide-books,
&amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>This trade, as regards a street-sale, has only
been known for nine or ten years, and had its
origination in the exertions of Mr. Hume, M.P.,
to secure to persons visiting the national exhibitions
the advantage of a cheap catalogue.
The guide-books were only sold, prior to this
time, <i>within</i> any public exhibition; and the profits&mdash;as
is the case at present&mdash;were the perquisite
of some official. When the sale was a
monopoly, the profit must have been considerable,
as the price was seldom less than 6<i>d.</i>, and
frequently 1<i>s.</i> The guide-books, or, as they are
more frequently called, catalogues, are now
sold by men who stand at the entrance, the approaches,
at a little distance on the line, or at
the corners of the adjacent streets, at the following
places:&mdash;The National Gallery, the
Vernon Gallery, the British Museum, Westminster
Abbey, the House of Lords, the
Society of Arts (occasionally), the Art-Union
(when open “free”), Greenwich Hospital, the
Dulwich Gallery, Hampton Court, Windsor
Castle, and Kew Gardens.</p>

<p>At any temporary exhibition, also, the same
trade is carried on&mdash;as it was largely when the
“designs,” &amp;c., for the decoration of the New
Houses of Parliament were exhibited in Westminster
Hall. There are, of course, very many
other catalogues, or explanatory guides, sold to
the visitors of other exhibitions, but I speak
only of the <i>street</i>-sale.</p>

<p>There are now, at the National Gallery,
three guidebook-sellers plying their trade in
the streets; eight at the British Museum; two
at Westminster Abbey; one at the House of
Lords, but only on Saturdays, when the House
is shown, by orders obtained gratuitously at the
Lord Chamberlain’s office, or “when appeals
are on;” one at the Vernon Gallery; two at
Dulwich (but not regularly, as there are none
at present), two at Hampton Court, “one near
each gate;” and one, and sometimes three, at
Windsor (generally sent out by a shopkeeper
there). There used to be one at the Thames
Tunnel, but “it grew so bad at last,” I was
told, “that a rat couldn’t have picked up his
grub at it&mdash;let alone a man.”</p>

<p>Among all these sellers I heard statements
of earning a most wretched pittance, and all
attributed it to the same cause. By the
National Gallery is a board, on which is an
announcement that the only authorized catalogue
of the works of art can be obtained
in the hall. There are similar announcements
at other public places. One man who had been
in this street trade, but had abandoned it, spoke
of these “boards,” as he called them, with
intense bitterness. “They’re the ruin of any
trade in the streets,” he said. “You needn’t
think because I’m out of it now, that I have a
pleasure in abusing the regulations; no, sir, I
look at it this way. Mr. Hume had trouble
enough, I know, to get the public a cheap
catalogue, and poor men were allowed to earn
honest bread by selling them in the streets, and
honest bread they would earn still, if it weren’t
for the board. I declare solemnly a man can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
get a living at the trade. The publishers can’t
prepare their catalogues without leave, and when
they’ve got leave, and do prepare and print
them, why isn’t a man allowed to sell them in
the streets, as I’ve sold second editions of the
<i>Globe</i> without ever the office putting out a
notice that the only authorized copy was to be
had within? God bless your soul, sir, it’s
shocking, shocking, poor men being hindered
every way. Anybody that looks on the board
looks on us as cheats and humbugs, and thinks
that our catalogues are all takes-in. But I’ve
heard gentlemen, that I’m sure knew what they
were talking about, say, in case they’d bought
in the street first, and then seen the board and
bought within after, so as to be sure of the real
thing&mdash;I’ve heard gentlemen, say, sir,&mdash;‘Why
what we got in the street is the best after all.’
Free trade! There’s plenty said about free
trade, but that board, sir, or call it what you
please, gives a monopoly against us. What I
have said, when I was starving on catalogues,
is this: Kick us out of the streets, commit us
for selling catalogues, as rogues and vagabonds;
or give us a fair chance. If we <i>may</i> sell, why
is the only authorised catalogue sold only
within? I wish Mr. Hume, or Mr. Cobden,
either, only understood the rights of the matter&mdash;it’s
of no account to me myself now&mdash;and I
think they’d soon set it to rights. Free trade!
Over the left, and with more hooks than one.”</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this representation and
this opinion would have been echoed by the
street catalogue-sellers, but they were evidently
unwilling to converse freely on this branch of
the subject, knowing the object for which I
questioned them, and that publicity would follow.
I attribute this reluctance chiefly to the
fact that, all these poor men look forward to the
opening of the Great Exhibition with earnest
hope and anxiety that the influx of visiters will
add greatly to their sale and profits; and they
are unwilling to jeopardise their privilege of
sale.</p>

<p>One man told me that he believed, from his
own knowledge, for he had not always “sold
outside,” that the largest buyers of these publications
were country people, sight-seeing in
London, for they bought the book not only as
an explanatory guide, but to preserve as a
memento of their visit. Such customers, however,
I heard from several quarters, the moment
they saw a “notice” as to the only authorised
copy, looked upon the street-sellers as a systematised
portion of the London sharpers, seeking
whom they might devour, and so bought
their catalogues “within.”</p>

<p>The best customers in the streets for the catalogues
are, I am assured, the working-classes,
who visit the national exhibitions on a holiday.
“I’ve oft enough heard them say,” one man
stated, “‘I’d rather pay a poor man 2<i>d.</i> any day,
when I can spare it, than rich people 1<i>d.</i> I
know what it is to fight for a crust.’”</p>

<p>At the National Gallery, the street-sold catalogues
are 1<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, and 6<i>d.</i>; in the hall, the
authorised copy is sold at 4<i>d.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> At the
British Museum, the street-charges are 3<i>d.</i> and
6<i>d.</i>; there were 1<i>d.</i> catalogues of this institution,
but they have been discontinued for the
last half-year, being found too meagre. At the
Vernon Gallery, the charge is 1<i>d.</i>; but the 6<i>d.</i>
guide-book to the National Gallery contains also
an account of the pictures in the Vernon Gallery.
At Westminster Abbey the price is 6<i>d.</i>,
and the same at the House of Lords. At
Hampton-court it is 2<i>d.</i>, 4<i>d.</i>, and 6<i>d.</i>, and at
the same rate as regards the other places mentioned.
At Hampton-court, I was told, the
street-sellers were not allowed to approach the
palace nearer than a certain space. One man
told me that he was threatened with being
“had in for trespassing, and Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; would
make him wheel a roller. Of course,” the man
continued, “there’s an authorised catalogue
there.”</p>

<p>The best sale of catalogues in the streets was
at the exhibition of the works of art for the
Houses of Parliament. The sellers, then&mdash;about
20 in number, among whom were four
women&mdash;cleared 2<i>s.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each daily. At
present, I am assured, that a good week is
considered one in which 5<i>s.</i> is made, but that 3<i>s.</i>
is more frequently the weekly earning. It must
be borne in mind, that at the two places most
resorted to&mdash;the National Gallery and the British
Museum&mdash;the street sale is only for four
days in the week at the first mentioned, and
three days at the second. “You may think
that more is made,” said one man, “but it
isn’t. Sweeping a good crossing is far better,
far. Bless your soul, only stand a few minutes
looking on, any day, and see what numbers and
numbers of people pass in and out of a free
admission place without ever laying out 1<i>d.</i>
Why, only last Monday and Wednesday (March
17 and 19, both very rainy days) I took only 5<i>d.</i>
I didn’t <i>take</i> more than 5<i>d.</i>, and I leave you to
judge the living I shall <i>clear</i> out of that; and I
know that the man with the catalogue at another
place, didn’t take 1<i>d.</i> It’s sad work, sir,
as you stand in the wet and cold, with no dinner
for yourself, and no great hope of taking one
home to your family.”</p>

<p>These street-sellers contrive, whenever they
can, to mix up other avocations with catalogue
selling, as the public institutions close early.
One, on every occasion, sells second editions of
the newspapers; another has “odd turns at
portering;” a third sells old umbrellas in the
streets; some sold exhibition cards in the Park,
on Sundays, until the sale was stopped; another
sells a little stationery; and nearly the whole of
them resort, on favourable opportunities, to the
sale of “books of the play,” or of “the
opera.”</p>

<p>Reckoning that there are regularly sixteen
street-sellers of guide-books&mdash;they do not interfere
with each other’s stations&mdash;and that each
clears 4<i>s.</i> weekly, we find £832 expended in
this street traffic. I have calculated only on the
usual bookseller’s allowance of 25 per cent.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
though, in some instances, these sellers are
supplied on lower terms&mdash;besides having, in
some of the catalogues, thirteen to the dozen;
but the amount specified does not exceed the
mark.</p>

<p>The greatest number of these guide-books
which I heard of as having been sold, in any
one day, was four dozen, disposed of on a fine
Whit-Monday, and for these the street-seller
only took 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> There are, I was informed,
half as many more “threepennies” as “sixpennies”
sold, and three times as many “pennies”
as the other two together.</p>

<p>The capital required to start is what may
suffice to “lay in” a stock of books&mdash;5<i>s.</i> generally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Fine Arts.</span></h3>

<p>These traders may be described as partaking
more of the characteristics of the street stationers
than of the “paper-workers,” as they are not
patterers. The trade is less exclusively than
the “paper-trade” in the hands of men. Those
carrying on this branch of the street-traffic
may be divided into the sellers of pictures
in frames, and of engravings (of all kinds), in
umbrellas. Under this head may also be
ranked the street-artists (though this is a trade
associated with street-life rather than forming
an integrant part of it), I allude more particularly
to the illustrated “boards” which are
prepared for the purposes of the street-patterers,
and are adapted for no other use. The
same artist that executes the greater portion of
the street-art, also prepares the paintings which
decorate the exterior of shows. There are also
the writers of manuscript music, and the makers
and sellers of “images” of all descriptions,
but this branch of the subject I shall treat
under the head of the street-Italians. Under
the same curious head I shall also speak of
the artists whose skill produces the street-sold
medallions, in wax or plaster, they being of the
same class as the “image” men. In both
“images” and “casts” and “moulded” productions
of all kinds the change and improvement
that have taken place, from the pristine
rudeness of “green parrots” is most remarkable
and creditable to the taste of working
people, who are the chief purchasers of the
smaller articles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Street Art.</span></h3>

<p>The artists who work for the street-sellers are
less numerous than the poets for the same trade.
Indeed, there is now but one man who can be
said to be <i>solely</i> a street-artist. The inopportune
illustration of ballads of which specimens have
already been given&mdash;or of any of the street
papers&mdash;are the work of cheap wood-engravers,
who give the execution of these orders to their
boys. But it is not often that illustrations are
prepared expressly for anything but what I
have described as “Gallows literature.” Of
these, samples have also been furnished. The
one of a real murder, and the other of a fabulous
one, or “cock,” together with a sample (in the
case of Mr. Patrick Connor) of the portraits
given in such productions. The cuts for the
heading of ballads are very often such as have
been used for the illustration of other works,
and are “picked up cheap.”</p>

<p>The artist who works especially for the street
trade&mdash;as in the case of the man who paints the
patterers’ boards&mdash;must address his art plainly
to the eye of the spectator. He must use the
most striking colours, be profuse in the application
of scarlet, light blue, orange&mdash;not yellow
I was told, it ain’t a good candlelight colour&mdash;and
must leave nothing to the imagination.
Perspective and back-grounds are things of but
minor consideration. Everything must be sacrificed
for effect.</p>

<p>These paintings are in water colours, and are
rubbed over with a solution of some gum-resin
to protect them from the influence of rainy
weather. Two of the subjects most in demand of
late for the patterers’ boards were “the Sloanes”
and “the Mannings.” The treatment of Jane
Wilbred was “worked” by twenty boardmen,
each with his “illustration” of the subject. The
illustrations were in six “compartments.” In
the first Mr. and Mrs. Sloane are “picking
out” the girl from a line of workhouse children.
She is represented as plump and healthy,
but with a stupid expression of countenance.
In another compartment, Sloane is beating the
girl, then attenuated and wretched-looking, with
a shoe, while his wife and Miss Devaux (a
name I generally heard pronounced among the
street-people as it is spelt to an English reader)
look approvingly on. The next picture was
Sloane compelling the girl to swallow filth.
The fourth represented her as in the hospital,
with her ribs protruding from her wasted body&mdash;“just
as I’ve worked Sarah Simpole,” said a
patterer, “who was confined in a cellar and fed
on ’tato peels. Sarah was a cock, sir, and a
ripper.” Then came the attack of the people
on Sloane, one old woman dressed after the
fashion of Mrs. Gamp, “prodding” him with
a huge and very green umbrella. The sixth
and last was, as usual, the trial.</p>

<p>I have described the “Sloanes’ board” first,
as it may be more fresh in the remembrance of
any reader observant of such things. In the
“Mannings’ board” there were the same number
of compartments as in the Sloanes’; showing
the circumstances of the murder, the discovery
of the body of Connor, the trial, &amp;c.
One standing patterer, who worked a Mannings’
board, told me that the picture of Mrs. Manning,
beautifully “dressed for dinner” in black satin,
with “a low front,” firing a pistol at Connor,
who was “washing himself,” while Manning, in
his shirt sleeves, looked on in evident alarm,
was greatly admired, especially out of town.
“The people said,” observed the patterer, “‘O,
look at him a-washing hisself; he’s a doing it so
nattral, and ain’t a-thinking he’s a-going to be
murdered. But was he really so ugly as that?
Lor! such a beautiful woman to have to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
him.’ You see, sir, Connor weren’t flattered,
and perhaps Mrs. Manning was. I have heard
the same sort of remarks both in town and
country. I patters hard on the women such
times, as I points them out on my board in murders
or any crimes. I says: ‘When there’s
mischief a woman’s always the first. Look at
Mrs. Manning there on that werry board&mdash;the
work of one of the first artists in London&mdash;it’s
a faithful likeness, taken from life at one of her
examinations, look at <i>her</i>. She fires the pistol,
as you can see, and her husband was her tool.’
I said, too, that Sloane was Mrs. Sloane’s tool.
It answers best, sir, in my opinion, going on that
patter. The men likes it, and the women doesn’t
object, for they’ll say: ‘Well, when a woman
is bad, she <i>is</i> bad, and is a disgrace to her sex.’
There’s the board before them when I runs on
that line of patter, and when I appeals to the
’lustration, it seems to cooper the thing. They
<i>must</i> believe their eyes.”</p>

<p>When there is “a run” on any particular
subject, there are occasionally jarrings&mdash;I was
informed by a “boardman”&mdash;between the artist
and his street-customers. The standing patterers
want “something more original” than their fellows,
especially if they are likely to work in the
same locality, while the artist prefers a faithful
copy of what he has already executed. The
artist, moreover, and with all reasonableness,
will say: “Why, you must have the facts. Do
you want me to make Eliza Chestney killing
Rush?” The matter is often compromised by
some change being introduced, and by the characters
being differently dressed. One man told
me, that in town and country he had seen Mrs.
Jermy shot in the following costumes, “in light
green welwet, sky-blue satin, crimson silk, and
vite muslin.” It was the same with Mrs.
Manning.</p>

<p>For the last six or eight years, I am told, the
artist in question has prepared all the boards in
demand. Previously, the standing patterers prepared
their own boards, when they fancied themselves
capable of such a “reach of art,” or had
them done by some unemployed painter, whom
they might fall in with at a lodging-house, or
elsewhere. This is rarely done now, I am told;
not perhaps more than six times in a twelvemonth,
and when done it is most frequently
practised of “cock-boards;” for, as was said to
me, “if a man thinks he’s getting up a fakement
likely to take, and wants a board to help
him on with it, he’ll try and keep it to hisself,
and come out with it quite fresh.”</p>

<p>The charge of the popular street-artist for the
painting of a board is 3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, according
to the simplicity or elaborateness of the details;
the board itself is provided by the artist’s employer.
The demand for this peculiar branch
of street art is very irregular, depending entirely
upon whether anything be “up” or not; that
is, whether there has or has not been perpetrated
any act of atrocity, which has riveted, as it is
called, the public attention. And so great is the
uncertainty felt by the street-folk, whether “the
most beautiful murder will take or not,” that it
is rarely the patterer will order, or the artist
will speculate, in anticipation of a demand, upon
preparing the painting of any event, until satisfied
that it has become “popular.” A deed of
more than usual daring, deceit, or mystery, may
be at once hailed by those connected with murder-patter,
as “one that will do,” and some
speculation may be ventured upon; as it was,
I am informed, in the cases of Tawell, Rush,
and the Mannings; but these are merely exceptional.
Thus, if the artist have a dozen boards
ordered “for this ten days, he may have two,
or one, or none for the next ten;” so uncertain,
it appears, is all that depends, without intrinsic
merit, on mere popular applause.</p>

<p>I am unable to give&mdash;owing to the want of
account-books, &amp;c., which I have so often had
to refer to as characteristic of street-people&mdash;a
precise account of the average number of
boards thus prepared in a year. Perhaps it may
be as close to the fact as possible to conclude
that the artist in question, who, unlike the
majority of the street-poets, is not a street-seller,
but works, as a professional man, <i>for</i> but not <i>in</i>
the streets, realises on his boards a profit of
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly. The pictorial productions for
street-shows will be more appropriately described
in the account of street-performers and showmen.</p>

<p>This artist, as I have shown concerning some
of the street-professors of the sister art of poesy,
has the quality of knowing how to adapt his
works exactly to the taste of his patrons the
sellers, and of their patrons, the buyers in the
streets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Engravings,
etc., in Umbrellas, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of “prints,” “pictures,” and “engravings”&mdash;I
heard them designated by each
term&mdash;in umbrellas in the streets, has been
known, as far as I could learn from the street-folk
for some fifteen years, and has been general
from ten to twelve years. In this traffic the
umbrella is inverted and the “stock” is disposed
within its expanse. Sometimes narrow
tapes are attached from rib to rib of the umbrella,
and within these tapes are placed the
pictures, one resting upon another. Sometimes
a few pins are used to attach the larger prints
to the cotton of the umbrella, the smaller ones
being “fitted in at the side” of the bigger.
“Pins is best, sir, in my opinion,” said a little
old man, who used to have a “print umbrella”
in the New Cut; “for the public has a more
unbrokener display. I used werry fine pins,
though they’s dearer, for people as has a penny
to spare likes to see things nice, and big pins
makes big holes in the pictures.”</p>

<p>This trade is most pursued on still summer
evenings, and the use of an inverted umbrella
seems so far appropriate that it can only be so
used, in the street, in <i>dry</i> weather. “I used
to keep a sharp look-out, sir,” said the same
informant, “for wind or rain, and many’s the
time them devils o’ boys&mdash;God forgive me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
they’s on’y poor children&mdash;but they <i>is</i> devils&mdash;has
come up to me and has said&mdash;one in particler,
standin’ afore the rest: ‘It’ll thunder
in five minutes, old bloke, so hup with yer
humbereller, and go ’ome; hup with it jist as
it is; it’ll show stunnin; and sell as yer goes.’
O, they’re a shocking torment, sir; nobody can
feel it like people in the streets,&mdash;shocking.”</p>

<p>The engravings thus sold are of all descriptions.
Some have evidently been the frontispieces
of sixpenny or lower-priced works. These
works sometimes fall into hands of the “waste
collectors,” and any “illustrations” are extracted
from the letter-press and are disposed of
by the collectors, by the gross or dozen, to those
warehousemen who supply the small shopkeepers
and the street-sellers. Sometimes, I
was informed, a number of engravings, which had
for a while appeared as “frontispieces” were
issued for sale separately. Many of these were
and are found in the “street umbrellas;” more
especially the portraits of popular actors and
actresses. “Mr. J. P. Kemble, as Hamlet”&mdash;“Mr.
Fawcett, as Captain Copp”&mdash;“Mr.
Young, as Iago”&mdash;“Mr. Liston, as Paul
Pry”&mdash;“Mrs. Siddons, as Lady Macbeth”&mdash;“Miss
O’Neil, as Belvidera,” &amp;c., &amp;c. In
the course of an inquiry into the subject nearly
a year and a half ago, I learned from one
“umbrella man” that, six or seven years previously,
he used to sell more portraits of “Mr.
Edmund Kean, as Richard III.,” than of anything
else. Engravings, too, which had first
been admired in the “Annuals”&mdash;when half-a-guinea
was the price of the “Literary
Souvenir,” the “Forget-me-not,” “Friendship’s
Offering,” the “Bijou,” &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;are
frequently found in these umbrellas; and
amongst them are not unfrequently seen portraits
of the aristocratic beauties of the day,
from “waste” “Flowers of Loveliness” and
old “Court Magazines,” which “go off very
fair.” The majority of these street-sold “engravings”
are “coloured,” in which state the
street-sellers prefer them, thinking them much
more saleable, though the information I received
hardly bears out their opinion.</p>

<p>The following statement, from a middle-aged
woman, further shows the nature of the trade,
and the class of customers:</p>

<p>“I’ve sat with an umbrella,” she said,
“these seven or eight years, I suppose it is.
My husband’s a penny lot-seller, with just a
middling pitch” [the vendor of a number of
articles, sold at a penny “a lot”] “and in the
summer I do a little in engravings, when I’m
not minding my husband’s ‘lots,’ for he has
sometimes a day, and oftener a night, with
portering and packing for a tradesman, that’s
known him long. Well, sir, I think I sell most
‘coloured.’ ‘Master Toms’ wasn’t bad last
summer. ‘Master Toms’ was pictures of cats,
sir&mdash;you must have seen them&mdash;and I had them
different colours. If a child looks on with its
father, very likely, it’ll want ‘pussy,’ and if the
child cries for it, it’s almost a sure sale, and
more, I think, indeed I’m sure, with men than
with women. Women knows the value of money
better than men, for men never understand what
housekeeping is. I have no children, thank
God, or they might be pinched, poor things.
‘Miss Kitties’ was the same sale. Toms is
hes, and Kitties is she cats. I’ve sometimes
sold to poor women who was tiresome; they
must have just what would fit over their
mantel-pieces, that was papered with pictures.”
[My readers may remember that
some of the descriptions I have given, long
previous to the present inquiry, of the rooms of
the poor, fully bear out this statement.] “I
seldom venture on anything above 1<i>d.</i>, I mean
to sell at 1<i>d.</i> I’ve had Toms and Kitties at
2<i>d.</i> though. ‘Fashions’ isn’t worth umbrella
room; the poorest needlewoman won’t be satisfied
with them from an umbrella. ‘Queens’
and ‘Alberts’ and ‘Wales’s’ and the other
children isn’t near so good as they was. There’s
so many ‘fine portraits of Her Majesty,’ or the
others, given away with the first number of this
or of that, that people’s overstocked. If a
working-man can buy a newspaper or a number,
why of course he may as well have a
picture with it. They gave away glasses of gin
at the opening of that baker’s shop there, and
it’s the same doctrine” [The word she used].
“I never offer penny theatres, or comic exhibitions,
or anything big; they spoils the look of
the umbrella, and makes better things look
mean. I sell only to working people, I think;
seldom to boys, and seldomer to girls; seldom
to servant-maids and hardly ever to women of
the town. I <i>have</i> taken 6<i>d.</i> from one of them
though. I think boys buy pictures for picture
books. I never had what I suppose was old
pictures. To a few old people, I’ve known,
‘Children’ sell fairly, when they’re made
plump, and red cheeked, and curly haired.
They sees a resemblance of their grandchildren,
perhaps, and buys. Young married people does
so too, but not so oft, I think. I don’t remember
that ever I have made more than 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> on an
evening. I don’t sell, or very seldom indeed,
at other times, and only in summer, and when
its fine. If I clear 5<i>s.</i> I counts that a good
week. It’s a great help to the lot-selling. I
seldom clear so much. Oftener 4<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>The principal sale of these “pictures,” in
the streets, is from umbrellas. Occasionally, a
street-stationer, or even a miscellaneous lot-seller,
when he has met with a cheap lot,
especially of portraits of ladies, will display a
collection of prints, pyramidally arranged on
his stall,&mdash;but these are exceptions. Sometimes,
too, an “umbrella print-seller” will have
a few “pictures in frames,” on a sort of stand
alongside the umbrella.</p>

<p>The pictures for the umbrellas are bought at
the warehouse, or the swag-shops, of which I
have before spoken. At these establishments
“prints” are commonly supplied from 3<i>d.</i> to
5<i>s.</i> the dozen. The street-sellers buy at 5<i>d.</i>
and 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, to sell at a 1<i>d.</i> a piece; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
at 3<i>d.</i> to sell at &frac12;<i>d.</i> <i>None</i> of the pictures thus
sold are prepared expressly for the streets.</p>

<p>In so desultory and&mdash;as one intelligent street-seller
with whom I conversed on the subject
described it&mdash;so <i>weathery</i> a trade, it is difficult
to arrive at exact statistics. From the best data
at my command, it may be computed, that for
twelve weeks of the year, there are thirty umbrella
print-sellers (all exceptional traders
therein included) each clearing 6<i>s.</i> weekly, and
taking 12<i>s.</i> Thus it appears that 216<i>l.</i> is yearly
expended in the streets in this purchase. Many
of the sellers are old or infirm; one who was
among the most prosperous before the changes
in the streets of Lambeth, was dwarfish, and
was delighted to be thought “a character.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Pictures in
Frames.</span></h3>

<p>From about 1810, or somewhat earlier, down
to 1830, or somewhat later, the street-sale of
pictures in frames was almost entirely in the
hands of the Jews. The subjects were then
nearly all scriptural: “The Offering up of
Isaac;” “Jacob’s Dream;” “The Crossing
of the Red Sea;” “The Death of Sisera;”
and “The Killing of Goliath from the Sling
of the youthful David.” But the Jew traders
did not at all account it necessary to confine
the subjects of their pictures to the records
of the Old&mdash;their best trade was in the illustrations
of the New Testament. Perhaps the
“Stoning of St. Stephen” was their most
saleable “picture in a frame.” There were
also “The Nativity;” “The Slaying of
the Children, by order of Herod” (with the
quotation of St. Matthew, chap. ii. verse 17,
“Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
Jeremy the prophet”); “The Sermon on the
Mount;” “The Beheading of John the Baptist;”
“The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem;” “The
Raising of Lazarus;” “The Betrayal on the
part of Judas;” “The Crucifixion;” and “The
Conversion of St. Paul.” There were others,
but these were the principal subjects. All
these pictures were coloured, and very deeply
coloured. St. Stephen was stoned in the lightest
of sky-blue short mantles. The pictures were
sold in the streets of London, mostly in the way
of hawking; but ten times as extensively, I am
told, in the country, as in town. Indeed, at
the present time, many a secluded village ale-house
has its parlour walls decorated with these
scriptural illustrations, which seem to have
superseded</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“The pictures placed for ornament and use;</div>
       <div class="verse">The twelve good rules; the royal game of goose,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>mentioned by Goldsmith as characteristic of a
village inn. These “Jew pictures” are now
yielding to others.</p>

<p>Most of these articles were varnished, and 2<i>s.</i>
or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each was frequently the price asked,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> being taken “if no better could be
done,” and sometimes 1<i>s.</i> A smaller amount
per single picture was always taken, if a set
were purchased. These productions were prepared
principally for street-sale and for hawkers.
The frames were narrower and meaner-looking
than in the present street-pictures of the kind;
they were stained like the present frames, in imitation
of maple, but far less skilfully. Sometimes
they were a black japan; sometimes a
sorry imitation of mahogany.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the Reform Bill era, the
street-pictures in frames most in demand were
Earl Grey, Earl Spencer’s (or Lord Althorp),
Lord Brougham’s, and Lord John Russell’s.
O’Connell’s also “sold well,” as did William
IV. “Queen Adelaide,” I was told, “went
off middling, not much more than half as good
as William.” Towards the close of King William’s
life, the portraits of the Princess Victoria
of Kent were of good sale in the streets,
and her Royal Highness was certainly represented
as a young lady of undue plumpness,
and had hardly justice done to her portraiture.
The Duchess of Kent, also, I was informed,
“sold fairish in the streets.” In a little time,
the picture in a frame of the Princess Victoria
of Kent, with merely an alteration in the title,
became available as Queen Victoria I., of Great
Britain and Ireland. Since that period, there
have been the princes and princesses, her Majesty’s
offspring, who present a strong family
resemblance.</p>

<p>The street pictures, so to speak, are not unfrequently
of a religious character. Pictures
of the Virgin and Child, of the Saviour seated
at the Last Supper, of the Crucifixion, or of
the different saints, generally coloured. The
principal purchasers of these “religious pictures”
are the poorer Irish. I remember seeing,
in the course of an inquiry among street-performers
last summer, the entire wall of a
poor street-dancer’s one room, except merely
the space occupied by the fireplace, covered
with small coloured pictures in frames, the
whole of which, the proprietor told me, with
some pride, he had picked up in the streets,
according as he could spare a few pence. Among
them were a crucifix (of bone), and a few medallions,
of a religious character, in plaster or
wax. This man was of Italian extraction; but
I have seen the same thing in the rooms of the
Roman Catholic Irish, though never to the
same extent.</p>

<p>The general subjects now most in demand for
street-sale are, “Lola Montes,” “Louis Philippe
and his Queen,” “The Sailor’s Return,” “The
Soldier’s Return,” and the “Parting” of the
same individuals, Smugglers, in different situations,
Poachers also; “Turpin’s Ride to York,”
the divers feats attributed to Jack Sheppard (but
less popular than “Turpin’s Ride,”) “Courtship,”
“Marriage” (the one a couple caressing,
and the other bickering), “Father Mathew” (in
very black large boots), “Napoleon Bonaparte
crossing the Alps,” and his “Farewell to his
Troops at Fontainebleau,” “Scenes of Piracy.”
None of these subjects are modern; “Lola
Montes” (a bold-faced woman, in a riding-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>habit),
being the newest. “Why,” said one
man familiar with the trade, “there hasn’t
been no Louis Napoleon in a frame-picture for
the streets, nor Cobdens, nor Feargus O’Connors,
nor Sir John Franklins; what is wanted
for us is something exciting.”</p>

<p>The prices of frame-pictures (as I sometimes
heard them called) made expressly for street-sale,
vary from 1<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a pair. The 1<i>d.</i> a pair
are about six inches by four, very rude, and on
thin paper, and with frames made of lath-wood
(stained), but put together very compactly.
The cheaper sorts are of prints bought at the
swag-shops, or of waste-dealers, sometimes
roughly coloured, and sometimes plain. The
greatest sale is of those charged from 2<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i>
the pair.</p>

<p>Some of the higher-priced pictures are painted
purposely for the streets, but are always copies
of some popular engraving, and their sale is not
a twentieth of the others. These frame-pictures
were, and are, generally got up by a family, the
girls taking the management of the paper-work,
the boys of the wood. The parents have, many
of them, been paper-stainers. This division of
labour is one reason of the exceeding cheapness
of this street branch of the fine arts. These
working artists&mdash;or whatever they are to be
called&mdash;also prepare and frame for street-sale
the plates given away in the first instance with
a number of a newspaper or a periodical, and
afterwards “to be had for next to nothing.”
The prevalence of such engravings has tended
greatly to diminish the sale of the pictures prepared
expressly for the streets.</p>

<p>Ten years ago this trade was ten times greater
than it is now. The principal sale still is, and
always was, at the street-markets on Saturday
evenings. They are sold piled on a small stall,
or carried under the arm. To sell 10<i>s.</i> worth on
a Saturday night is an extraordinary sale, and
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is a bad one, and the frame-picturer
must have “middling patter to set them off at
all. ‘Twopence a pair!’ he’ll say; ‘only twopence
a pair! Who’d be without an ornament
to his dwelling?’”</p>

<p>There are now about fifty persons engaged in
this sale on a Saturday night, of whom the
majority are the artists or preparers of the pictures.
On a Monday evening there are about
twenty sellers; and not half that number on
other evenings&mdash;but some “take a round in the
suburbs.”</p>

<p>If these people take 10<i>s.</i> weekly for frame-pictures
the year through, 1,040<i>l.</i> is yearly
expended in this way. I estimate the average
number at twenty daily. Their profits are
about cent. per cent.; boys and working people
buy the most. The trade is often promoted by
a raffle at a public-house. Many mechanics,
I was told, now frame their own pictures.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Manuscript
and other Music.</span></h3>

<p>This trade used to be more extensively carried
on in the streets than it is at present. The
reasons I heard assigned for the decadence were
the greater cheapness of musical productions
generally, and the present fondness for lithographic
embellishments to every polka, waltz,
quadrille, ballad, &amp;c., &amp;c. “People now hates,
I do believe, a <i>bare</i> music-sheet,” one street-seller
remarked.</p>

<p>The street manuscript-music trade was, certainly,
and principally, piratical. An air
became popular perhaps on a sudden, as it was
pointed out to me, in the case, of “Jump, Jim
Crow.” At a musical publisher’s, such an
affair in the first bloom of its popularity, would
have been charged from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, twenty-five
years ago, and the street-seller at that time,
often also a book-stall keeper, would employ, or
buy of those who offered them for sale, and who
copied them for the purpose, a manuscript of
the demanded music, which he could sell cheap
in comparison.</p>

<p>A man who, until the charges of which I
have before spoken, kept a second-hand book-stall,
in a sort of arched passage in the New
Cut, Lambeth, sold manuscript-music, and was
often “sadly bothered,” he said, at one time by
the musical propensities of a man who looked
like a journeyman tailor. This man, whenever
he had laid out a trifle at the book-stall, looked
over the music, and often pulled a small flute
from his pocket, and began to play a few bars
from one of the manuscripts, and this he continued
doing, to the displeasure of the stall-keeper,
until a crowd began to assemble, thinking,
perhaps, that the flute-player was a street-musician;
he was then obliged to desist. Of
the kind of music he sold, or of its mode of
production, this street-bookseller knew nothing.
He purchased it of a man who carried it to his
stall, and as he found it sell tolerably well, he
gave himself no further trouble concerning it.
The supplier of the manuscript pencilled on
each sheet the price it was to be offered at,
allowing the stall-keeper from 50 to 150 per
cent. profit, if the price marked was obtained.
“I haven’t seen anything of him, sir,” said the
street-bookseller, “for a long while. I dare
say he was some poor musicianer, or singer, or
a reduced gentleman, perhaps, for he always
came after dusk, or else on bad dark days.”</p>

<p>Although but partially connected with street-art,
I may mention as a sample of the music
sometimes offered in street-sale, that a book-stall
keeper, three weeks ago showed me a pile
of music which he had purchased from a
“waste collector,” about eight months before,
at 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> the pound. Among this was some MS.
music, which I specify below, and which the
book-stall keeper was confident, on very insufficient
grounds, I think, had been done for
street-sale.</p>

<p>The music had, as regards three-fourths of it,
evidently been bound, and had been torn from
the boards of the book, as only the paper portion
is purchased for “waste.” Some, however,
were loose sheets, which had evidently never
been subjected to the process of stitching. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
now cite some of the titles of this street-sale:
“Le Petit Tambour. Sujet d’un Grand Rondeau
pour le Piano Forte. Composé par L. Zerbini,”
(MS.) “Di Tanti Palpiti. The Celebrated
Cavatina, by Rossini, &amp;c.” “Twenty
Short Lessons, or Preludes in the most Convenient
Keys for the Harp. Composed and
Respectfully Dedicated to Lady Ann Collins.
By John Baptist Meyer. Price 5<i>s.</i>” “An
Cota Caol (given in the ancient Irish character.)
The Slender Coat,” (MS.) “Cailin beog chruite
na mbo (also in Irish). The Pretty Girl Milking
the Cow,” (MS.)</p>

<p>There are now no persons regularly employed
in preparing MS. music for the streets. But
occasionally a person skilled in music writing
will, when he or she, I was told, had nothing
better in hand, do a little for the street sale,
disposing of the MSS. to any street-stationer or
bookseller. If four persons are this way employed,
receiving 4<i>s.</i> a week each, the year
through&mdash;which I am assured is the extent&mdash;we
find upwards of 40<i>l.</i> thus earned, and
about twice that sum taken by the street retailers.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_CAPITAL_AND_INCOME_OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_STATIONERY_LITERATURE_AND_THE_FINE_ARTS"></a>OF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF STATIONERY,
LITERATURE, AND THE FINE ARTS.</h2>
</div>


<p>I now proceed to give a summary of the capital,
and income of the above classes. I will first
however, endeavour to give a summary of the
number of individuals belonging to the class.</p>

<p>This appears to be made up (so far as I am
able to ascertain) of the following items:&mdash;120
sellers of stationery; 20 sellers of pocket-books
and diaries; 50 sellers of almanacks and memorandum-books;
12 sellers of account-books; 31
card-sellers; 6 secret papers-sellers; 250 sellers
of songs and ballads; 90 running patterers; 20
standing patterers; 8 sellers of “cocks” (principally
elopements); 15 selling conundrums,
“comic exhibitions,” &amp;c.; 200 selling play-bills
and books for the play; 40 back-number-sellers;
4 waste paper-sellers at Billingsgate; 40 sellers
of tracts and pamphlets; 12 newsvenders, &amp;c.,
at steam-boat piers; 2 book auctioneers; 70
book-stall keepers and book barrow-men; 16
sellers of guide-books; 30 sellers of song-books
and children’s books; 40 dealers in pictures in
frames; 30 vendors of engravings in umbrellas,
and 4 sellers of manuscript music&mdash;making
altogether a total of 1,110. Many of the above
street-trades are, however, only temporary. As,
for instance, the street-sale of playing-cards,
continues only fourteen days in the year; pocket-books
and diaries, four weeks; others, again, are
not regularly pursued from day to day, as the sale
of prints and engravings in umbrellas, which
affords employment for but twelve weeks out of
the fifty-two, and conundrums for two months.
One trade, however, (namely, that of “Comic
Exhibition Papers,” gelatine and engraved cards
of the Exhibition) is entirely now in the streets.
In the broad-sheet trade, again, the “running
patterers” work what are called “cocks,” when
there are no incidents happening to incite the
public mind. Hence, making due allowances
for such variations, we may fairly assume that
the street-sellers belonging to this class number
at least 1,000. The following statistics will
show the whole amount of capital, and the gross
income of this branch of street traffic.</p>

The cost of the “Nuts to Crack” (when new) is 5<i>d.</i> a dozen to the seller; but old “Nuts” often answer the purpose of the street-seller, and may be had for about half the price; the cost of the “Nut-crackers” is 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It may be calculated, then, that to realize the 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> above-mentioned 15<i>s.</i> must be taken.

<h3><span class="smcap">An Epitome of the Pattering Class.</span></h3>

<p>I wish, before passing to the next subject&mdash;the
street-sellers of manufactured articles (of one
of whom the engraving here given furnishes a
well-known specimen)&mdash;I wish, I say, as I find
some mistakes have occurred on the subject, to
give the public a general view of the patterers,
as well as to offer some few observations concerning
the means of improving the habits of
street-people in general.</p>

<p>The patterers consist of three distinct classes;
viz., those who sell something, and patter to
help off their goods; those who exhibit something,
and patter to help off the show; and
those who do nothing but patter, with a view
to elicit alms. Under the head of “Patterers
who sell” may be classed</p>

<ul>
<li>Paper Workers,</li>
<li>Quack Doctors,</li>
<li>Cheap Jacks,</li>
<li>Grease Removers,</li>
<li>Wager Patterers,</li>
<li>Ring Sellers,</li>
<li>Dealers in Corn Salve,</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Razor Paste,</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  French Polish,</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Plating Balls,</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Candle Shades,</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rat Poisons, &amp;</li>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Blacking,</li>
<li>Book Auctioneers.</li>
</ul>


<p>The second class of patterers includes jugglers,
showmen, clowns, and fortune-tellers; beside
several exhibitors who invite public notice
to the wonders of the telescope or microscope.</p>

<p>The third and last class of patterers are
those who neither sell nor amuse, but only
victimise those who get into their clutches.
These (to use their own words) “do it on the
bounce.” Their general resort is an inferior
public-house, sometimes a brothel, or a coffee-shop.
One of the tricks of these worthies is to
group together at a window, and if a well-dressed
person pass by, to salute him with the contents
of a flour-bag. One of their pals&mdash;better
dressed than the rest&mdash;immediately walks out,
declares it was purely accidental, and invites
the gentleman in “to be brushed.” Probably
he consents, and still more probably, if he be
“good-natured,” he is plied with liquor, drugged
with snuff for the occasion, and left in some obscure
court, utterly stupified. When he awakes,
he finds that his watch, purse, &amp;c., are gone.</p>

<p>“A casual observer, or even a stranger, may
be induced to contract a wayside acquaintance
with the parties to whom I allude,” says one of
the pattering class, from whom I have received
much valuable information; “and if he be a
visitor of fairs and races, that acquaintance,
though slight, may sometimes prove expensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
But casual observers cannot, from the complexity
and varied circumstances of the characters
now under notice, form anything like a
correct view of them. I am convinced that no one
can, but those who have visited their haunts and
indeed lived among them for months together.
They are not to be known, any more than the
great city was to be built, in a day. This advantage&mdash;if
so it may be called&mdash;has fallen to
my lot.”</p>

<p>The three classes of patterers above enumerated
must not be confounded. The two first
are essentially distinct from the last&mdash;at least
they do <i>something</i> for their living; and though
the pattering street-tradesmen may generally
overstep the bounds of truth in their glowing
descriptions of the virtues of the goods they
sell, still it should be remembered they are no
more dishonest in their dealings than the “enterprising”
class of shopkeepers, who resort to
the <i>printed</i> mode of puffing off their wares,&mdash;indeed
the street-sellers are far less reprehensible
than their more wealthy brother puffers of
the shops, who cannot plead want as an excuse
for their dishonesty. The recent revelations
made by the <i>Lancet</i>, as to the adulteration of the
articles of diet sold by the London grocers,
show that the patterers who sell, practise far
less imposition than some of our “merchant
princes.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A tradesman in Tottenham-court Road, whose address
the <i>Lancet</i> advertises gratis, thus proclaims the
superior qualities of his ‘<i>Finest</i> <span class="smcap">White Pepper</span>. One
package of this article, which is the interior part of the
kernel of the finest pepper, being equal in strength to
nearly three times the quantity of black pepper (which
is the inferior, small, shrivelled berries, and often little
more than husks), it will be not only the best but the
cheapest for every purpose.’ This super-excellent
pepper, ‘sold in packages, price 1<i>d.</i>,’ was found on
analysis to consist of finely-ground <i>black pepper, and
a very large quantity of wheat-flour</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Indeed the <i>Lancet</i> has demonstrated that as
regards tea, coffee, arrow-root, sugar, and
pepper sold by “pattering” shopkeepers, the
rule invariably is that those are articles which
are the most puffed, and “warranted free from
adulteration,” and “to which the attention of
families and <i>invalids</i> is particularly directed as
being of the finest quality ever imported into
this country,” are uniformly the most scandalously
adulterated of all.</p>

<p>We should, therefore, remember while venting
our indignation against pattering street-sellers,
that they are not the only puffers in the
world, and that they, at least, can plead poverty
in extenuation of their offence; whereas, it
must be confessed, that shopkeepers can have
no other cause for their acts but their own
brutalizing greed of gain.</p>

<p>The class of patterers with whom we have
here to deal are those who patter to help off
their goods&mdash;but while describing them it has
been deemed advisable to say a few words, also,
on the class who <i>do nothing but patter</i>, as a
means of exciting commiseration to their assumed
calamities. These parties, it should be
distinctly understood, are in no way connected
with the puffing street-sellers, but in the exaggerated
character of the orations they deliver,
they are mostly professional beggars&mdash;or bouncers
(that is to say cheats of the lowest <i>kind</i>),
and <i>will</i> not work or do anything for their
living. This, at least, cannot be urged against
the pattering street-sellers who, as was before
stated, do <i>something</i> for the bread they eat.</p>

<p>Further to show the extent, and system, of
the lodging and routes throughout the country
of the class of “lurkers,” &amp;c., here described&mdash;as
all resorting to those places&mdash;I got a patterer
to write me out a list, from his own knowledge,
of divers routes, and the extent of accommodation
in the lodging-houses. I give it according
to the patterer’s own classification.</p>

<p>“<i>Brighton</i> is a town where there is a great
many furnished cribs, let to needys (nightly
lodgers) that are molled up,” [that is to say,
associated with women in the sleeping-rooms.]</p>

<p>“<i>Bristol.</i>&mdash;A few years back an old woman
kept a padding-ken here. She was a strong
Methodist, but had a queer method. There was
thirty standing beds, besides make-shifts and
furnished rooms, which were called ‘cottages.’
It’s not so bad now. The place was well-known
to the monkry, and you was reckoned flat if
you hadn’t been there. The old woman, when any
female, old or young, who had no tin, came into
the kitchen, made up a match for her with some
men. Fellows half-drunk had the old women.
There was always a broomstick at hand, and
they was both made to jump over it, and that
was called a broomstick wedding. Without that
ceremony a couple weren’t looked on as man
and wife. In course the man paid, in such
case, for the dos (bed.)</p>

<p>“<i>Counties of Kent and Essex.</i>&mdash;Here is the best
places in England for ‘skipper-birds;’ (parties
that never go to lodging-houses, but to barns or
outhouses, sometimes without a blanket.) The
Kent farmers permit it to their own travellers,
or the travellers they know. In Essex it’s different.
There a farmer will give 1<i>s.</i> rather than
let a traveller sleep on his premises, for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of robbery. ‘Keyhole whistlers,’ the skipper-birds
are sometimes called, but they’re regular
travellers. Kent’s the first county in England
for them. They start early to good houses for
victuals, when gentlefolk are not up. I’ve seen
them doze and sleep against the door. They
like to be there before any one cuts their cart
(exposes their tricks). Travellers are all early
risers. It’s good morning in the country when
it’s good night in town.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Screevers,” or Writers of
Begging-Letters and Petitions.</span></h3>

<p>“Screeving”&mdash;that is to say, <i>writing</i> false or
exaggerated accounts of afflictions and privations,
is a necessary corollary to “Pattering,” or making
pompous <i>orations</i> in public&mdash;and I here subjoin
a brief description of the “business”&mdash;for
although the “screevers,” “economically” considered,
belong properly to the class who will <i>not
work</i>, yet as they are intimately connected with
the street-trade of begging I have thought
it best to say a few words on the subject
here, reserving a more comprehensive and
scientific view of the subject till such time as
I come to treat of the <i>professional</i> beggar, under
the head of those who are <i>able</i> but <i>unwilling</i> to
labour for their livelihood, in contradistinction
to the involuntary beggars, who belong more
properly to those who are <i>willing</i> but <i>unable</i> to
work. The subjoined information has been
obtained from one who has had many opportunities
of making himself acquainted with the
habits and tricks of the class here treated of,&mdash;indeed,
at one part of his life he himself belonged
to the “profession.”</p>

<p>“In England and Wales the number of
vagrants committed to prison annually amounts
to 19,621; and as many are not imprisoned
more than a dozen times during their lives, and
a few never at all, the number of tramps and
beggars may be estimated, at the very lowest,
at 22,000 throughout England and Wales. The
returns from Scotland are indeterminate. Of
this wretched class many are aged and infirm;
others are destitute orphans; while not a few are
persons whose distress is real, and who suffer
from temporary causes.</p>

<p>“With this excusable class, however, I have
not now to do. Of professional beggars there
are two kinds&mdash;those who ‘do it on the <i>blob</i>’
(by word of mouth), and those who do it by
‘<i>screeving</i>,’ that is, by petitions and letters,
setting forth imaginary cases of distress.</p>

<p>“Of these documents there are two sorts,
‘slums’ (letters) and ‘fakements’ (petitions).
These are seldom written by the persons who
present or send them, but are the production
of a class of whom the public little imagine
either the number or turpitude. I mean the
‘professional begging-letter writers.’</p>

<p>“Persons who write begging-letters for others
sometimes, though seldom, beg themselves.
They are in many cases well supported by the
fraternity for whom they write. A professional
of this kind is called by the ‘cadgers,’ ‘their
man of business.’ Their histories vary as much
as their abilities; generally speaking they have
been clerks, teachers, shopmen, reduced gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>men,
or the illegitimate sons of members of
the aristocracy; while others, after having received
a liberal education, have broken away
from parental control, and commenced the ‘profession’
in early life, and will probably pursue
it to their graves.</p>

<p>“I shall take a cursory view of the various
pretences set forth in these begging documents,”
says my informant, “and describe
some of the scenes connected with their preparation.
The documents themselves are
mournful catalogues of all the ills that flesh is
heir to.</p>

<p>“I address myself first to that class of petitions
which represent losses by sea, or perhaps
shipwreck itself. These documents are very
seldom carried by one person, unless indeed he
is really an old sailor; and, to the credit of the
navy be it spoken, this is very seldom the case.
When the imposition under notice has to be
carried out, it is, for the most part, conducted
by half-a-dozen worthless men, dressed in the
garb of seamen (and known as turnpike sailors),
one of their number having really been at sea
and therefore able to reply to any nautical
inquiries which suspicion may throw out.
This person mostly carries the document; and
is, of course, the spokesman of the company.
Generally speaking, the gang have a subscription-book,
sometimes only a fly-leaf or two to
the document, to receive the names of contributors.</p>

<p>“It may not be out of place here, to give a
specimen&mdash;drawn from memory&mdash;of one of those
specious but deceitful ‘fakements’ upon which
the ‘swells,’ (especially those who have ‘been
in the service,’) ‘come down with a <i>couter</i>’
(sovereign) if they ‘granny the mauley’ (perceive
the signature) of a brother officer or
friend. The document is generally as <span class="lock">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘<span class="gothic">These are to Certify</span>, to all whom it may
concern, that the <span class="smcap">Thunderer</span>, Captain Johnson,
was returning on her homeward-bound
passage from China, laden with tea, fruit, &amp;c.,
and having beside, twenty passengers, chiefly
ladies, and a crew of thirty hands, exclusive of
the captain and other officers. That the said
vessel encountered a tremendous gale off the
banks of Newfoundland, and was dismasted, and
finally wrecked at midnight on’ (such a day,
including the hour, latitude, and other particulars).
‘That the above-named vessel speedily
foundered, and only the second mate and four
of the crew (the bearers of this certificate)
escaped a watery grave. These, after floating
several days on broken pieces of the ship, were
providentially discovered, and humanely picked

<p>“I have already hinted at the character and
description of the persons by whom these
forgeries are framed. It would seem, from
the example given, that such documents are
available in every sea-port or other considerable
town; but this is not the case. It is
true that certain kinds of documents, especially
sham hawkers’ licenses, may be had in the
provinces, at prices suited to the importance
of their contents, or to the probable gains of
their circulation; but all the ‘regular bang-up
fakes’ are manufactured in the ‘Start’ (metropolis),
and sent into the country to order, carefully
packed up, and free from observation.
The following note, sent to ‘Carotty Poll, at
Mrs. Finder’s Login-ouse facin the orse and
trumpet bere shop han street Westminster London
with spede,’ may tend to illuminate the
uninitiated as to how such ‘fakements’ are
obtained:</p>

<p>“The person from whom the above letter
was obtained, was in the lodging-house when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
arrived, and had it given him to read and
retain for reference. Lawyer Joe was soon
sent for; and the following is an outline of the
scene that occurred, given in my informant’s
own words:</p>

<p>“I had called at the house whither the
above letter had been addressed, to inquire
for a man whom I had known in his and my
own better days. The kitchen-door, or rather
cellar-door, was thrust open, and in came Carrotty
Poll herself.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Poll,’ asked the deputy, ‘how does
the world use you?’</p>

<p>“‘B&mdash; bad,’ was the reply, ‘where’s Lawyer
Joe?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, he’s just gone to Mother Linstead’s
for some tea and sugar; here he comes.’</p>

<p>“‘Joe, I’ve a job for you. How much do
you charge for screeving a “brake?”’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, half a bull (half-a-crown).’</p>

<p>“‘No, I’ll give you a deuce o’ deeners (two
shillings), co’s don’t ye see the poor b&mdash; is in
“stir” (prison).’</p>

<p>“‘Well, well, I shan’t stand for a tanner.
Have you got paper?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, and a Queen’s head, and all.’</p>

<p>“The pen and ink were found, a corner of
the table cleared, and operations commenced.</p>

<p>“‘He writes a good hand,’ exclaimed one,
as the screever wrote the petition.</p>

<p>“‘I wish I could do it,’ said another.</p>

<p>“‘If you could, you’d soon be transported,’
said a third; while the whole kitchen in one
chorus, immediately on its completion, proclaimed,
that it was d&mdash;d well done, adding to
that, not one ‘swell’ in a score would view it
in any other light than a ‘ream’ (genuine)
concern.</p>

<p>“Lawyer Joe was up to his trade&mdash;he folded
the paper in official style&mdash;creased it as if it
was long written and often examined, attached
the signatures of the minister and churchwardens,
and dipping his fingers under the fireplace,
smeared it with ashes, and made the
whole the best representation of a true account
of ‘a horse in the mad staggers’ and ‘a child
in the measles’ that could be desired by the
oldest and best cadger on the monkry.</p>

<p>“These professional writers are in possession
of many autographs of charitable persons, and
as they keep a dozen or more bottles of different
shades of ink, and seldom write two documents
on exactly the same sort of paper, it is difficult
to detect the imposition. A famous lurker who
has been previously alluded to in this work,
was once taken before a magistrate at York
whose <i>own</i> signature was attached to his fakement.
The imitation was excellent, and the
‘lurker’ swore hard and fast to the worthy
justice that he (the justice) <i>did</i> write it in his
own saddle-room, as he was preparing to ride,
and gave him five shillings, too. The effrontery
and firmness of the prisoner’s statement gained
him his discharge!</p>

<p>“It is not uncommon in extensive districts&mdash;say,
for instance, a section of a county taking
in ten or a dozen townships&mdash;for a school of
lurkers to keep a secretary and remit his work
and his pay at the same time. In London this
functionary is generally paid by commission,
and sometimes partly in food, beer, and tobacco.
The following is a fair estimate of the scale of
charges:</p>

<p>“Such is an outline, open to circumstantial
variation, of the pay received for the sort of
accommodation required.</p>

<p>“There is a very important species of ‘lurking’
or ‘screeving,’ which has not yet been alluded
to.</p>

<p>“It is well-known that in the colliery districts
an explosion of fire-damp frequently takes place,
when many lives are lost, and the men who
escape are often so wounded as to render amputation
of a leg or arm the only probable means
of saving them from the grave. Of course the
accident, with every particular as to date and
locality, goes the round of the newspapers. Such
an event is a sort of God-send to the begging-letter
writer. If he is anything of a draughtsman,
so much the better. He then procures a
sheet of vellum, and heads it with a picture of
an explosion, and exhibiting men, boys, and
horses up in the air, and a few nearer the ground,
minus a head, a leg, or an arm; with a background
of women tearing their hair, and a few
little girls crying. Such a ‘fakement,’ professionally
filled up and put into the hands of
an experienced lurker, will bring the ‘amanuensis,’
or ‘screever,’ two guineas at least, and
the proceeds of such an expedition have in many
cases averaged 60<i>l.</i> per week. The lurker presenting
this would have to take with him three
or four countrymen, dressed in the garb of colliers,
one at least knowing something of underground
work. These he would engage at ‘a bob
a nob’ (one shilling each), and if he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
good day, give them a ‘toothful o’ rum’ beside.
As such men are always left outside the jigger
(door) of the houses, they are of course ignorant
of the state of the subscription-list.</p>

<p>“A famous lurker, to whom we have previously
referred, Nicholas A&mdash;&mdash;, kept ‘a man
of business’ to himself, and gave him from 5<i>s.</i>
to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day. Nicholas, who was tolerably
educated, could write very well, but as his
‘secretary’ could imitate twelve different hands,
he was of course no trifling acquisition.</p>

<p>“It would not be easy to trace the history of
all, or even many of the men, who pursue the
begging-letter trade as professional writers.
Many of the vagrant tribe write their own letters,
but the vast majority are obliged to have
assistance. Of course, they are sometimes detected
by the fact that their conversation does
not tally with the rhetorical statement of the
petition. The few really deserving persons, well-born
and highly educated, who subsist by begging,
are very retired and cautious in their
appeals. They write concisely, and their statements
are generally true to a certain extent, or
perhaps rigidly so in relation to an earlier part
of their history. These seldom live in the very
common lodging-houses.</p>

<p>“The most renowned of the tribe who write for
others, and whose general trade lies in forged
certificates of bankruptcy, seizure of goods for
rent, and medical testimonies to infirmity, is an
Irishman, brought up in London, and who may
be seen almost every night at the bar of a certain
public-house in Drury-lane. He lives, or
did live, at one of the model lodging-houses.
Very few persons know his occupation. They
suppose that he is ‘connected with the press.’
Several years ago this person, says one who
knew this trade well, was ‘regularly hard up,’
and made a tender of his services to a distinguished
M.P., who took a lively interest in the
emancipation of the Jews. He offered to visit
the provinces, hold meetings, and get up petitions.
The hon. member tested his abilities,
and gave him clothes and a ten-pound note to
commence operations. ‘I saw him’ (says my
informant) ‘the same night, and he mooted the
subject to me over a glass of whiskey-punch.
‘Not that <i>I</i> care (said he) if all the b&mdash;y Jews
were in h&mdash;ll, but I must do something.’</p>

<p>“‘But how,’ asked my informant, ‘will you
get up the meetings?&mdash;and then the signatures,
you know!’</p>

<p>“‘Meetings!’ was the reply, ‘don’t mention
it; I can get <i>millions of signatures</i>!’</p>

<p>“The pretended Jewish Advocate never left
London. He got (from Ireland) a box of old
documents relative to bygone petitions for
repeal, &amp;c., and on these he put a frontispiece
suited to his purpose&mdash;got them sent to
Bath and Bristol, and thence transmitted to his
employer&mdash;who praised his perseverance, and
sent more money to the post-office of one of
the above-named towns; this was countermanded
to London, and jovially spent at Tom
Spring’s’ in Holborn.</p>

<p>“Hitherto the movements of the begging-letter
writer&mdash;self-considered&mdash;have been chiefly dwelt
upon. There is another class of the fraternity,
however, of whom some notice must here be
taken; viz., those, who to meet cases of great
pretension, and consequent misgivings on the
part of the noblemen or gentry to whom fakements
are presented, become referees to professional
beggars. These referees are kept by
local ‘schools’ of beggars in well-furnished
apartments at respectable houses, and well
dressed; their allowance varies from 1<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i>
per week.</p>

<p>“But the most expert and least suspected
dodge is referring to some dignified person in
the country; a person however who exists
nowhere but in imagination. Suppose (says
my informant) I am a beggar, I apply to you
for relief. Perhaps I state that I am in prospect
of lucrative employment, if I could get
enough money to clothe myself. You plead
the number of impositions; I consent to that
fact, but offer you references as to the truth of
my statement. I refer you to the Hon. and
Rev. Mr. Erskine, at Cheltenham (any name
or place will do). You promise to write, and
tell me to call in a few days; meanwhile, I
assume the name of the gentleman to whom I
have referred you, and write forthwith to the
post-master of the town in question, requesting
that any letter coming there directed to the
Hon. and Rev. Mr. Erskine, may be forwarded
to my present address. I thus discover what
you have written, frame a flattering reply,
and address it to you. I send it (under cover)
to a pal of mine at Cheltenham, or elsewhere,
who posts it; I call half an hour after you
receive it, and, being satisfied, you give me a
donation, and perhaps introduce me to some of
your friends. Thus I raise a handsome sum,
and the fraud is probably never found out.</p>

<p>“One of the London lurkers, who has good
means of forming a calculation on the subject,
assures me that the average earnings of
‘lurkers’ in London alone (including those
who write for them), cannot be less than 6,000<i>l.</i>
per annum.</p>

<p>“Two of the class were lately apprehended,
at the instance of the Duke of Wellington; on
their persons was found fifteen sovereigns, one
five-pound note, a silver watch with gold
guard, and two gold watches with a ribbon
attached to each; their subscription-book
showed that they had collected 620<i>l.</i> during
the current year.</p>

<p>“A man named M’Kensie&mdash;who was transported
at the last Bristol Assizes&mdash;had just
received a cheque for 100<i>l.</i> from a nobleman
lately deceased.</p>

<p>“Most of the ‘professionals’ of this class include
a copy of the ‘Court Guide’ among
their stock in trade. In this all the persons
known to be charitable, have the mark <img src="images/0641a.png" class="inline" alt="cross in circle" /> set
against their names. I have been furnished
with a list of such persons, accompanied with
comments, from the note-book of ‘an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Probable Means of Reformation.</span></h3>

<p>I shall now conclude this account of the patterers,
lurkers, and screevers, with some observations
from the pen of one who has had ample
means of judging as to the effect of the several
plans now in operation for the reformation or
improvement of the class.</p>

<p>“In looking over the number of institutions,”
writes the person alluded to, “designed to reform
and improve the classes under review, we are, as
it were, overwhelmed with their numerous
branches; and though it is highly gratifying to
see so much good being done, it is necessary to
confine this notice to the examination of only the
most prominent, with their general characteristics.</p>

<p>“The churches, on many considerations&mdash;personal
feelings being the smallest, but not
unknown&mdash;demand attention first. I must treat
this subject (for your work is not a theological
magazine) without respect to doctrine,
principle, or legislation.</p>

<p>“The object of erecting churches in poor
neighbourhoods is to benefit the poor; why is it,
then, that the instruction communicated should
exercise so little influence upon the vicious, the
destitute, and the outcast? Is it that Christian
ordinances are less adapted to them than to
others? Or, rather, is it not that the public
institutions of the clergy are not made <i>interesting</i>
to the wretched community in question?
The great hindrance (in my opinion) to the progress
of religion among the unsettled classes
is, that having been occasionally to church or
chapel, and heard nothing but doctrinal lectures
or feverish mental effusions, they cannot see the
application of these to every-day trade and practice;
and so they arrive at the conclusion, that
they can get as much or more good at home.</p>

<p>“Our preachers seem to be <i>afraid</i> of ascertaining
the sentiments, feelings, and habits of
the more wretched part of the population; and,
without this, their words will die away upon the
wind, and no practical echo answer their addresses.</p>

<p>“It will, perhaps, relieve the monotony of
this statement if I give an illustration communicated
to me by a person well acquainted to determine
the merits of the question.</p>

<p>“Your readers will probably recollect the
opposition experienced by Dr. Hampden on
his promotion to the bishopric of Hereford.
Shortly after the affair was settled, his lordship
accepted an invitation to preach on behalf
of the schools connected with the ‘ten new
churches’ of Bethnal-green. The church selected
for the purpose was the one on Friar’s-mount.
It was one July Sunday in 1849, and,
as I well remember, the morning was very wet;
but, supposing the curiosity, or better motives,
of the public would induce a large congregation,
I went to the church at half-past ten. The free-seats
occupying the middle aisle were all filled,
and chiefly with persons of the lowest and worst
classes, many of whom I personally knew, and
was agreeably surprised to find them in such
a place.</p>

<p>“I sat in the midst of the group, and at the
elbow of a tall attenuated beggar, known by the
name of ‘Lath and Plaster,’ of whom it is but
justice to say that he repeated the responsive
parts of the service very correctly. It is true
he could not read; but having ‘larned a few
prayers’ in the ‘Downs’ (Tothill-fields prison),
‘he always sed ’em, night and morning, if he
wasn’t drunk, and then he sed ’em <i>twice</i> next
day, ’cos,’ reasoned he, ‘I likes to rub off as I
goes on.’</p>

<p>“In course of time, the bishop made his
appearance in the pulpit. His subject was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
neglected education, and he illustrated it from
the history of Eli.</p>

<p>“I thought proper to hang back, and observe
the group as they passed out of church. There
was Tailor Tom, and Brummagem Dick, and
Keate-street Nancy, and Davy the Duke, and
Stationer George, and at least two dozen more,
most of whom were miserably clad, and several
apparently without a shirt. They were not,
however, without halfpence; and as I was well
known to several of the party, and flattered as
being ‘a very knowledgeable man,’ I was invited
to the Cat and Bagpipes afterwards, to
‘have share of what was going.’</p>

<p>“I was anxious,” continues my informant,
“to learn from my companions their opinion of
the right reverend prelate. They thought, to
use their own words, ‘he was a jolly old brick.’
But did they think he was sound in opinion
about the Trinity, or was he (as alleged) a
Unitarian? They did not even understand
the meaning of these words. All they <i>did</i>
understand was, that ‘a top-sawyer parson at
Oxford, called Dr. Pussy,’ had ‘made himself
disagreeable,’ and that some of the bishops
and nobility had ‘jined him;’ that these had
persecuted Dr. Hampden, because he was
‘more cleverer’ than themselves; and that Lord
John Russell, who, generally speaking, was ‘a
regular muff,’ had ‘acted like a man’ in this
instance, and ‘he ought to be commended for
it; and,’ added the man who pronounced the
above sentiment, ‘<i>it’s just a picture of ourselves</i>.’
To other ears than mine, the closing remark
would have appeared impertinent, but I ‘tumbled
to’ it immediately. It was a case of oppression;
and whether the oppressors belonged to
Oxford University or to Scotland-yard militated
nothing against the aphorism: ‘it’s just a picture
of ourselves!’</p>

<p>“It seems to me that these poor creatures understood
the <i>circumstances</i> better than they did
the sermon; and my inference is, that whether
from the parochial pulpit, or the missionary exhortation,
or in the printed form of a tract, those
who wish to produce a practical effect must
themselves be practical men. I, who have
been in the Christian ministry, and am familiar,
unhappily, with the sufferings of men of every
grade among the outcast, would say: ‘If you
wish to do these poor outcasts real good, you
must mould your language to their ideas, get
hold of their common phrases&mdash;those which tell
so powerfully when they are speaking to each
other&mdash;let them have their own <i>fashion</i> of
things, and, where it does not interfere with
order and decency, use yourselves language
which their unpolished minds will appreciate;
and then, having gained their entire confidence,
and, perhaps, their esteem, you may
safely strike home, though it be as with a
sledge-hammer, and they will even ‘love you
for the smart.’</p>

<p>“The temperance movement next claims attention,
and I doubt not that much crime and
degradation has been prevented by total abstinence
from all intoxicating drinks; but I would
rather raise the tone of moral feeling by intelligent
and ennobling means than by those spasmodic
efforts, which are without deliberation,
and often without permanency. The object
sought to be obtained, however, is good,&mdash;so is
the motive,&mdash;and I leave to others to judge what
means are most likely to secure it.</p>

<p>“I may also allude, as another means of
reformation, to the Ragged-schools which are
now studding the localities of the poorest
neighbourhoods. The object of these schools
is, one would hope, to take care of the uncared
for, and to give instruction to those who
would be otherwise running wild and growing
up as a pest to society. A few instances of real
reform stand, however, in juxtaposition with
many of increased hardihood. I, as a man,
seeing those who resort to ragged-schools, cannot
understand the propriety of insulting an
honest though ragged boy by classing him with
a young thief; or the hope of improving the
juvenile female character where the sexes are
brought in promiscuous contact, and left unrestrained
on their way home to say and do everything
subversive of the good instruction they
have received.” [It is right I should here
state, that these are my informant’s own unbiassed
sentiments, delivered without communication
with myself on the subject. I say thus
much, because, my own opinions being known,
it might perhaps appear as if I had exerted
some influence over the judgment of my correspondent.]</p>

<p>“The most efficient means of moral reform
among the street-folk, appear to have
been consulted by those who, in Westminster
and other places, have opened institutions
cheaper, but equally efficient, as the mechanics’
institutes of the metropolis. In these, for
one farthing per night, three-halfpence a week,
or sixpence a month, lectures, exhibitions, newspapers,
&amp;c., are available to the <i>very</i> poor.
These, and such as these, I humbly but earnestly
would commend to public sympathy and
support, believing that, under the auspices of
heaven, they may ‘deliver the outcast and poor’
from their own mistaken views and practices,
and make them ornamental to that society to
which they have long been expensive and dangerous.”</p>

<p>Another laudable attempt to improve the condition
of the poorer class is by the erection of
model lodging-houses. The plan which induced
this measure was good, and the success has been
tolerable; but I am inclined to think the management
of these houses, as well as their internal
regulation, is scarcely what their well-meaning
founders designed. The principal of
these buildings is in George-street, St. Giles’s;
the building is spacious and well ventilated,
there is a good library, and the class of lodgers
very superior to what might be expected. This
latter circumstance makes the house in question
scarcely admissible to the catalogue of reformed
lodging-houses for the <i>very</i> poor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“The next ‘model lodging-house’ in importance
is the one in Charles-street, Drury-lane.
This, from personal observation (having
lodged in it more than four months),” says my
informant, “I can safely say (so far as social reform
is concerned), is a miserable failure. The
bed-rooms are clean, but the sitting-room, though
large, is the scene of dirt and disorder. Noise,
confusion, and intemperance abound from morning
till night.</p>

<p>“There is a model lodging-house in Westminster,
the private property of Lord Kinnaird.
It is generally well conducted. His lordship’s
agent visits the place once a week. There is
an almost profuse supply of cooking utensils and
other similar comforts. There are, moreover,
two spacious reading-rooms, abundance of books
and periodicals, and every lodger, on payment
of 6<i>d.</i>, is provided with two lockers&mdash;one in his
bed-room, and the other below-stairs. The
money is returned when the person leaves the
house. There is divine service every day, conducted
by different missionaries, and twice on
Sundays. Attendance on these services is optional;
and as there are two ways of ingress and
egress, the devout and undevout need not come
in contact with each other. The kitchen is very
large and detached from the house. The master
of this establishment is a man well fitted for his
situation. He is a native of Saffron Walden in
Essex, where his father farmed his own estate.
He received a superior education, and has twice
had a fortune at his own disposal. He <i>did</i> dispose
of it, however; and ‘after many roving years,’ as
a ‘traveller,’ ‘lurker,’ and ‘patterer,’ he has
settled down in his present situation, and maintained
it with great credit for a considerable
period. The beds in this house are only 3<i>d.</i> per
night, and no small praise is due to Lord Kinnaird
for the superiority of this ‘model’ over
others of the same denomination.</p>

<p>“Such are a few of the principal of these
establishments. Giving every credit to their
founders, however, for purity and even excellence
of motive, I doubt if ‘model lodging-houses,’
as at present conducted, are likely to
accomplish much real good for those who get
their living in the streets. Ever and anon they
are visited by dukes and bishops, lords and ladies,
who march in procession past every table, scrutinise
every countenance, make their remarks
upon the quantity and quality of food, and then
go into the lobby, sign their names, jump into
their carriages, and drive away, declaring that
‘after all’ there is not so much poverty in
London as they supposed.</p>

<p>“The poor inmates of these houses, moreover,”
adds my informant, “are kept in bondage,
and made to <i>feel</i> that bondage, to the almost
annihilation of old English independence. It
is thought by the managers of these establishments,
and with some share of propriety, that
persons who get their living by any honest means
may get home and go to bed, according to strict
rule, at a certain prescribed hour&mdash;in one house
it is ten o’clock, in the others eleven. But many
of the best-conducted of these poor people, if
they be street-folk, are at those very hours in
the height of their business, and have therefore
to pack up their goods, and carry homeward
their cumbersome and perhaps heavy load a
distance usually varying from two or three to
six or seven miles. <i>If they are a minute beyond
time, they are shut out, and have to seek lodgings
in a strange place. On their return next morning,
they are charged for the bed they were prevented
from occupying, and if they demur they are at once
expelled!</i> Thus the ‘model’ lodgers are kept,
as it were, in leading-strings, and triumphed
over by lords and ladies, masters and matrons,
who, while they pique themselves on the efforts
they are making to ‘better the condition of the
poor,’ are making them their slaves, and driving
them into unreasonable thraldom; while the rich
and noble managers, reckless of their own professed
benevolence, are making the poor poorer,
by adding insult to wretchedness. If my remarks
upon these establishments appear,” adds
the writer of the above remarks, “to be invidious,
it is only in ‘appearance’ that they
are so. I give their promoters credit for the
best intentions, and, as far as sanitary and moral
measures are concerned, I rejoice in the benefit
while suggesting the improvement.</p>

<p>“Everything even moderately valuable has its
counterfeit. We have counterfeit money, counterfeit
virtue, counterfeit modesty, counterfeit
religion, and last, but not least, ‘counterfeit
model lodging-houses.’ Many private adventurers
have thus dignified their domiciles, and
some of them highly merit the distinction, while
with others it is only a cloak for greater uncleanliness
and grosser immorality.</p>

<p>“There has come to my knowledge the case
of one man, who owns nearly a dozen of these
dens of infamy, in one of which a poor girl
under fifteen was lately ruined by a gray-headed
monster, who, according to the pseudo-‘model’
regulations, slept in an adjoining bed.
The sham model-houses to which I more
particularly allude,” says my correspondent,
“are in Short’s-gardens, Drury-lane; Mill-yard,
Cable-street; Keate-street, Flower and Dean-street,
Thrawl-street, Spitalfields; Plough-court,
Whitechapel; and Union-court, Holborn. All of
these are, <i>without exception</i>, twopenny brothels,
head-quarters of low-lived procuresses, and resorts
of young thieves and prostitutes. Each
of the houses is managed by a ‘deputy,’ who
receives an income of 8<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per week, out of
which he has to provide coke, candles, soap, &amp;c.
Of course it is impossible to do this from such
small resources, and the men consequently
increase their salaries by ‘taking in couples
for a little while,’ purchasing stolen goods, and
other nefarious practices. <i>Worse than all, the
person owning these houses is a member of a
strict Baptist church, and the son of a deceased
minister. He lives in great splendour in one of
the fashionable streets in Pimlico.</i></p>

<p>“It still remains for me,” my correspondent
continues, “to contemplate the best agency for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
promoting the reformation of the poor. The
‘City Mission,’ if properly conducted, as it
brings many good men in close contact with
the ‘outcast and poor,’ might be made productive
of real and extensive good. Whether
it has done so, or done so to any extent, is
perhaps an open question. Our town missionary
societies sprang up when our different
Christian denominations were not fully alive
to the apprehension of their own duties to
their poorer brethren, who were lost to principle,
conscience, and society. That the object
of the London City Mission is most noble, needs
no discussion, and admits of no dispute. The
method of carrying out this great object is by
employing agents, who are required to give
their whole time to the work, without engaging
in any secular concerns of life; and regarding
the operation of the work so done, I must say
that great good has resulted from the enterprise.
At the commencement of the labours of
the Mission in any particular locality great opposition
was manifested, and a great amount of
prejudice, with habits of the most immoral kind&mdash;openly
carried on without any public censure&mdash;had
to be overcome. The statements of
the missionaries have from time to time been
published, and lie recorded against us as a
nation, of the glaring evils and ignorance of a
vast portion of our people. It is principally
owing to the city missionaries that the other
portions of society have known what they now
do of the practices and habits of the poor; it is
principally due to their exertions that schools
have been established in connection with their
labours; and the Ragged-schools&mdash;one of the
principal movements of the last few years&mdash;are
mainly to be attributed to their efforts.</p>

<p>“A man,” says my informant in conclusion,
“can receive little benefit from a thing he does
not understand; the talk which will do for the
senate will not do for the cottage, and the argument
which will do for the study will not do for
the man who spends all his spare time in a public-house.
These remarks will apply to the
distribution of tracts, which should be couched
in the very language that is used by the people
to whom they are addressed; then the ideas will
penetrate their understanding. Some years back
I met with an old sailor in a lodging-house in
Westminster, who professed a belief that there
had <i>once</i> been a God, but that he was either dead,
or grown old and diseased. He did not dispute
the inspiration of the Bible. He believed that
there had been revelations made to our forefathers
when God was alive and active, but that
now the Almighty did not ‘fash’ (trouble) himself
about his creatures at all!</p>

<p>“I endeavoured to instruct the man in his
own rude language and ideas; and after he had
thus been made to comprehend the doctrine of
the Atonement, he said, ‘I see it all plain
enough&mdash;though I’ve liked a drop o’ drink, and
been a devil among the gals, and all that, in my
time, if I’ll humble myself I can have it all
wiped off; and, as the song says, “We may be
happy yet,” because, as the saying is, it’s all
square with God A’mighty.’ Whether the
sailor permanently reformed, I am unable to
say, for I lost sight of him shortly after; at any
rate he <i>understood</i> the subject, and was thus
qualified to profit by it. And what can the
teachers of Christianity among the British
heathen&mdash;herded together in courts and alleys&mdash;tell
their poor ignorant hearers better than the
old sailor’s aphorism, ‘You have, indeed, gone
astray from your greatest and best Friend, but,
if you so desire, “You may be happy yet,” because
it’s all square with God A’mighty?’</p>

<p>“Before quitting this subject, I would add,
if you really wish to do these poor creatures
good, you must remember that your instructions
are not intended for so-called fashionable society,
but for those who have a fashion of their
own. If you lose sight of this fact, your words
will die away upon the wind, and no echo in the
hearts of these poor people will answer your
addresses.”</p>

<p>The above observations are from the pen of
one who has not only had the means, but is
likewise possessed of the power, of judging as to
the effect of the several plans (now in course of
operation) for the reformation and improvement
of the London poor. I have given the comments
in the writer’s own language, because I was
anxious that the public should know the opinions
of the best informed of the street-people themselves
on this subject; and I trust I need not
say that I have sought in no way to influence
my correspondent’s judgment.</p>

<p>I now subjoin a communication from a clergyman
in the country, touching the character of
the tramps and lurkers frequenting his neighbourhood,
together with some suggestions concerning
the means of improving the condition of
the London poor. These I append, because it
is advisable that in so difficult a matter the
sentiments of every one having sufficient experience,
judgment, and heart to fit him to speak
on the subject should be calmly attended to, so
that amid much counsel there may be at least
some little wisdom.</p>

<p>“The subject of the welfare of our poorer
brethren was one which engaged much of my
attention twenty years ago, when studying for
the bar at Lincoln’s Inn, before I entered into
orders; and the inquiries, &amp;c., then made by
me in reference to London, are recalled by many
of your pages. I have pursued the same course,
according to my limited means and opportunities
(for my <i>benefice</i>, like thousands of others,
is but 100<i>l.</i> a-year) in this neighbourhood, and
there are very many of my clerical brethren,
also, deeply anxious and exerting their means
for the country poor. The details given in your
numbers as to the country tramps and patterers,
I can fully corroborate from personal experience
and knowledge, so far as the country part of it.
We <i>never</i> give money to beggars here, on any
pretence whatever. We never give clothes. We
never give relief to a <i>naked</i> or <i>half-naked</i> man if
we can avoid it (the imposture is too barefaced).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Medicine I <i>do</i> give occasionally to the sick, or
pretended sick, and <i>see</i> them take it. Every
beggar may have <i>dry bread</i>, or three or four
tracts to sell, but never both. I know we are
even thus <i>often</i> imposed on; but it is better to
run this risk than to turn away, by chance, a
starving man; and I do see the mendicants often
sit down on a field near, and eat the dry bread
with ravenous look. The tramps sometimes
come to church on Sunday, and <i>then</i> beg: but we
never give even bread on Sunday, because on
that day they can get help at the Union workhouse,
and it only tempts idlers. Sometimes we
are days without a beggar, and then there will
be ten to twenty per day, and then all at once
the stream stops. There are no tramp lodging-houses
in my parish (which is a village of 600
or 700 people). Most of the burglaries hereabouts
seem connected with some inroad of
tramps into the neighbourhood. The lodging-houses
are very bad in some of the small towns
near, but somehow the magistrates cannot get
them put down. The gentry are alive here to
the evil of crowded cottages, &amp;c., and are using
efforts to build better and more decent ones.
But the evil results from the little landowners,
who have an acre or two, or less, and build rows
of cottages on them of the scantiest dimensions,
at high rents,&mdash;ten per cent. on the cost of building.
The rents of the gentry and nobility are
very moderate to the poor, viz., scarcely two per
cent. (beyond the yearly repairs) on the market
value of the cottage.</p>

<p>“In 1832 I succeeded in getting land allotments
for the poor here, and most of the parishes
round have followed our example since. The
success <i>to the poor</i> has always depended on the
rent being a <i>real</i> rent, such as is paid by the
land round about, and on the rules of good
management and of payment of rent being
rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>“The character of the poor of England <i>must</i>
be raised, as well as their independence. They
must not be left to lean on charity. I am sure
that the sterling worth of the English character
can only be raised by that means <i>to the surface</i>
of society among the poor. The “English” is
a fine material, but the poor neither value, nor
are benefited, by mawkish nonsense or excessive
feeling.</p>

<p>“I believe this parish was one of the most
fearfully demoralized twenty years ago. It
was said there was not <i>one</i> young female cottager
of virtuous character. There was not one man
who was not, or had not been, a drunkard; and
theft, fighting, &amp;c., &amp;c., were universal. It is
greatly better now&mdash;totally different&mdash;and I
attribute the change to the land allotments, the
provident society, the village horticultural society,
the lending library, the clothing club, the
coal club, the cultivating a taste for music, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., as subsidiary to the more directly pastoral
work of a clergyman, and the schools, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“I am probably visionary in my ideas, but
the perusal of your pages has led me to think
that, were I clergyman of a parish where the
street-folks <i>lived</i>, I should aim at some schemes
of this style, in addition to the benefit society
and loan society (the last <i>most</i> important) as
proposed by yourself.</p>

<p>“(1) To get music taught at &frac12;<i>d.</i> a week, or
something of the kind&mdash;<i>a ragged-school music-room</i>,
if the people would learn gratis, would be
still better&mdash;as a <i>step</i> to a “superior” music
class at 1<i>d.</i> per week.</p>

<p>“(2) To get the poor to adorn their rooms
<i>plentifully</i> with a better class of pictures&mdash;of
places, of people, of natural history, and of historical
and religious subjects&mdash;just as they
might like, and a circulating library for pictures
if they preferred change. This I find takes with
the village poor. Provide these things excessively
cheap for them&mdash;at <i>nominal prices</i>, just
high enough to prevent them being <i>sold</i> at a
profit by the poor.</p>

<p>“(3) To establish a monthly or fortnightly
sheet&mdash;or little book for the poor&mdash;at &frac12;<i>d.</i>, or some
trifle, <i>full of pictures</i> such as they would like,
but free from impropriety. It might be called
‘The Coster’s Barrow,’ or some name which
would take their fancy, and contain pictures
for those who cannot read, and reading for those
who can. Its contents should be instructive, and
yet lively; as for instance, the ‘History of London
Bridge,’ ‘History of a Codfish,’ ‘Travels of
Whelks,’ ‘Dreams of St. Paul’s,’ (old History of
England), ‘Voice from the Bottom of the Coal
Exchange’ (Roman tales), ‘True Tale of Trafalgar,’
&amp;c., &amp;c. All <i>very short articles</i>, at
which perhaps they might be angry, or praise,
or abuse, or <i>do anything</i>, but still would read, or
hear, and talk about. If possible, the little
work might have a corner called, ‘The Next
World’s Page,’ or any name of the kind, with
<i>nothing</i> in it but the Lord’s Prayer, or the Creed,
or the Ten Commandments, or a Parable, or
Miracle, or discourse of Christ’s&mdash;in the exact
words of Scripture&mdash;without <i>any</i> commentary;
which could neither annoy the Roman Catholics
nor others. Those parts in which the Douay
version differs from ours might be avoided, and
the Romanists be given to understand that they
would <i>always</i> be avoided.</p>

<p>“The more difficult question of cheap
amusements instead of the demoralizing ones
now popular, is one which as yet I cannot see
my way through&mdash;-but it is one which <i>must</i> be
grappled with if any good is to be done.</p>

<p>“I write thus,” adds my correspondent, “because
I feel you are a fellow-worker&mdash;so far as
your labours show it, for the cause of God’s
poor&mdash;and therefore will sympathize in anything
another worker can say from experience
on the same subject.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are the opinions of two of my correspondents&mdash;each
looking at the subject from
different points of view&mdash;the one living among
the people of whom he treats, and daily witnessing
the effects of the several plans now in
operation for the moral and physical improvement
of the poor, and the other in frequent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>tercourse
with the tramps and lurkers, on their
vagrant excursions through the country, as well
as with the resident poor of his own parish&mdash;the
former living in friendly communion with those
of whom he writes, and the latter visiting them
as their spiritual adviser and material benefactor.</p>

<p>I would, however, before passing to the consideration
of the next subject, here pause to
draw special attention to the distinctive features
of the several classes of people obtaining their
livelihood in the streets. These viewed in regard
to the <i>causes</i> which have induced them to adopt
this mode of life, may be arranged in three
different groups, viz.:</p>

<p>(1.) Those who are <i>bred</i> to the streets.</p>

<p>(2.) Those who <i>take</i> to the streets.</p>

<p>(3.) Those who are <i>driven</i> to the streets.</p>

<p>The class bred to the streets are those whose
fathers having been street-sellers before them,
have sent them out into the thoroughfares at an
early age to sell either watercresses, lavender,
oranges, nuts, flowers, apples, onions, &amp;c., as a
means of eking out the family income. Of
such street-apprenticeship several notable instances
have already been given; and one or
two classes of juvenile street-sellers, as the
lucifer match, and the blacking-sellers, still
remain to be described. Another class of
street-apprentice is to be found in the boys
engaged to wheel the barrows of the costers,
and who are thus at an early age tutored in all
the art and mystery of street traffic, and who
rarely abandon it at maturity. These two
classes may be said to constitute the <i>natives</i> of
the streets&mdash;the tribe <i>indigenous</i> to the paving-stones&mdash;imbibing
the habits and morals of the
gutters almost with their mothers’ milk. To
expect that children thus nursed in the lap
of the kennel, should when men not bear the
impress of the circumstances amid which they
have been reared, is to expect to find costermongers
heroes instead of ordinary human beings.
We might as well blame the various races on
the face of the earth for those several geographical
peculiarities of taste, which constitute
their national characteristics. Surely there is a
moral acclimatisation as well as a physical one,
and the heart may become inured to a particular
atmosphere in the same manner as the
body; and even as the seed of the apple returns,
unless grafted, to its original crab, so does the
child, without training, go back to its parent
stock&mdash;the vagabond savage. For the bred and
born street-seller, who inherits a barrow as
some do coronets, to be other than he is&mdash;it has
here been repeatedly enunciated&mdash;is no fault of
his but of ours, who could and yet <i>will</i> not
move to make him otherwise. Might not “the
finest gentleman in Europe” have been the
greatest blackguard in Billingsgate, had he
been born to carry a fish-basket on his head
instead of a crown? and by a parity of reasoning
let the roughest “rough” outside the London
fish-market have had his lot in life cast, “by
the Grace of God, King, Defender of the Faith,”
and surely his shoulders would have glittered
with diamond epaulettes instead of fish scales.</p>

<p>I say thus much, to impress upon the
reader a deep and devout sense, that we who
have been appointed to another state, are, by
the grace of God, what we are, and from no
special merit of our own, to which, in the arrogance
of our self-conceit, we are too prone to
attribute the social and moral differences of our
nature. Go to a lady of fashion and tell her
she could have even become a fishfag, and she
will think you some mad ethnologist (if indeed
she had ever heard of the science). Let me
not, however, while thus seeking to impress the
reader’s mind with a sense of the “antecedents”
of the human character, be thought to espouse
the doctrine that men are <i>merely</i> the creatures
of events. All I wish to enforce is, that the
three common causes of the social and moral
differences of individuals are to be found in
<i>race</i>, <i>organization</i>, and <i>circumstances</i>&mdash;that none
of us are entirely proof against the influence of
these three conditions&mdash;the <i>ethnological</i>, the
<i>physiological</i>, and the <i>associative</i> elements of our
idiosincracy. But, while I admit the full
force of external nature upon us all, while I
allow that we are, in many respects, merely
patients, still I cannot but perceive that, in
other respects we are self-agents, moving rather
than being moved, by events&mdash;often stemming
the current of circumstances, and at other
times giving to it a special direction rather than
being swept along with it. I am conscious that
it is this directive and controlling power, not
only over external events, but over the events of
my own nature, that distinguishes me as well from
the brute of the fields as it does my waking from
my sleeping moments. I know, moreover, that in
proportion as a man is active or passive in his
operations, so is his humanity or brutality developed;
that true greatness lies in the superiority
of the internal forces over the external
ones; and that as heroes, or extraordinary men
are heroes, because they overcome the sway of
one or other, or all, of the three material influences
above-named, so ordinary people are
ordinary, simply because they lack energy&mdash;principle&mdash;will
(call it what you please) to
overcome the material elements of their nature
with the spiritual. And it is precisely because
I know this, that I <i>do</i> know that those who are
bred to the streets must bear about them the
moral impress of the kennel and the gutter&mdash;unless
<i>we</i> seek to develope the inward and controlling
part of their constitution. If we allow
them to remain the creatures of circumstances,
to wander through life principleless, purposeless,
conscienceless&mdash;if it be their lot to be flung
on the wide waste of waters without a “guiding
star” above, or a rudder or compass within,
how can <i>we</i> (the well-fed) <i>dare</i> to blame them
because, wanting bread, they prey and live
upon their fellow-creatures?</p>

<p>I say thus much, because I feel satisfied that
a large portion of the street-folk&mdash;and especially
those who have been <i>bred</i> to the business&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of improvable natures; that they crave
knowledge, as starving men for “the staff of
life;” that they are most grateful for instruction;
that they are as deeply moved by any
kindness and sympathy (when once their suspicion
has been overcome) as they are excited
by any wrong or oppression&mdash;and I say it
moreover, because I feel thoroughly convinced
of the ineffectiveness of the present educational
resources for the poor. We think, if we teach
them reading and writing, and to chatter a creed,
that we have armed them against the temptations,
the trials, and the exasperations of life,
believing, because we have put the knife and
fork in their hands that we have really filled
with food the empty bellies of their brains. We
exercise their memories, make them human
parrots, and then wonder that they do not act
as human beings. The intellect, the conscience,
the taste, indeed all that refines, enlightens,
and ennobles our nature, we leave
untouched, to shrivel and wither like unused
limbs. The beautiful, the admirable, the true,
the right, are as hidden to them as at their first
day’s schooling. We impress them with no
purpose, animate them with no principle; they
are still the same brute creatures of circumstances&mdash;the
same passive instruments&mdash;human
waifs and strays&mdash;left to be blown about as the
storms of life may whirl them.</p>

<p>Of the second group, or those who <i>take</i> to
the streets, I entertain very different opinions.
This class is distinguished from that above
mentioned, in being wanderers by choice, rather
than wanderers by necessity. In the early chapters
of this work, I strove to point out to my
readers that the human race universally consisted
of two distinct classes: the wanderers and
the settlers&mdash;the civilized and the savage&mdash;those
who <i>produced</i> their food, and those who merely
<i>collected</i> it. I sought further to show, that these
two classes were not necessarily isolated, but that,
on the contrary, almost every civilized tribe had
its nomadic race, like parasites, living upon it.
These nomadic races I proved, moreover, to have
several characteristics common to the class, one
of the most remarkable of which was, their
adoption of a <i>secret</i> language, with the intent of
concealing their designs and exploits. “Strange
to say,” I then observed, “that despite its privations,
dangers, and hardships, those who have
once taken to a wandering life rarely abandon
it. There are countless instances,” I added, “of
white men adopting all the usages of an Indian
hunter; but there is not one example of the Indian
hunter or trapper, adopting the steady and
regular habits of civilized society.” That this
passion for “a roving life” (to use the common
expression by which many of the street-people
themselves designate it), is a marked feature
of some natures, there cannot be a doubt in the
mind of any one who has contemplated even
the surface differences of human beings; and
nevertheless it is a point to which no social philosopher
has yet drawn attention. To my mind,
it is essentially the <i>physical</i> cause of crime. Too
restive and volatile to pursue the slow process
of production, the wanderers, and consequently
the <i>collectors</i>, of subsistence must (in a land
where all things are appropriated) live upon the
stock of the <i>producers</i>. The nomadic or vagrant
class have all an universal type, whether they be
the Bushmen of Africa or the “tramps” of our
own country; and Mr. Knapp, the intelligent
master of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union,
to whom I was referred at the time of my investigations
touching the subject of vagrancy,
as having the greatest experience upon the
matter, gave me the following graphic account,
which, as I said at the time of its first publication,
had perhaps never been surpassed as an
analysis of the habits and propensities of the
vagabond class:</p>

<p>“Ignorance,” to use the gentleman’s own
words, “is certainly not their prevailing characteristic:
indeed, with a few exceptions, it is the
reverse. The vagrants are mostly distinguished
by their aversion to continuous labour of any
kind. He never knew them to work. Their
great inclination is to be on the move, and wandering
from place to place, and they appear to
receive a great deal of pleasure from the assembly
and conversation of the casual ward. They
are physically stout and healthy, and certainly
not emaciated or sickly. They belong especially
to the able-bodied class, being, as he says, full
of health and mischief. They are very stubborn
and self-willed. They are a most difficult class
to govern, and are especially restive under the
least restraint; they can ill brook control, and
they find great delight in thwarting the authorities.
They are particularly fond of amusements
of all kinds. He never knew them love
reading. They mostly pass under fictitious
names. They are particularly distinguished by
their libidinous propensities. They are not remarkable
for a love of drink. He considers
them to be generally a class possessing the
keenest intellect, and of a highly enterprising
character. They seem to have no sense of
danger, and to be especially delighted with such
acts as involve any peril. They are likewise
characterised by their exceeding love of mischief.
They generally are of a most restless
and volatile disposition. They have great
quickness of perception, but little power of continuous
attention or perseverance. They have
a keen sense of the ridiculous, and are not devoid
of deep feeling. In the summer they make
regular tours through the country, visiting all
places that they have not seen. They are perfectly
organized, so that any regulation affecting
their comforts or interests becomes known among
the whole body in a remarkably short space of
time.”</p>

<p>Every day my inquiries add some fresh proof
to the justice of the above enumeration of the
several phenomena distinguishing this class. To
the more sedate portion of the human family,
the attractions of “a roving life” are inexplicable.
Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that,
to the more volatile, the mere muscular exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and the continual change of scene, together with
the wild delight which attends the overcoming
of any danger, are sources of pleasure sufficient
to compensate for all the privations and hardships
attending such a state of existence.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruxton, one of the many who have passed
from settlers to wanderers, has given us the
following description of the enjoyments of a life
in the wilderness:</p>

<p>“Although liable to an accusation of barbarism,
I must confess that the very happiest
moments of my life have been spent in the
wilderness of the Far West; and I never recall,
but with pleasure, the remembrance of my
solitary camp in the Bayou Solade, with no
friend near me more faithful than my rifle, and
no companions more sociable than my good
horse and mules, or the attendant cayute which
nightly serenaded us. Seldom did I ever wish
to change such hours of freedom for all the
luxuries of civilized life; and unnatural and
extraordinary as it may appear, yet such is the
fascination of the life of the mountain hunter,
that I believe not one instance could be adduced
of even the most polished and civilized of men,
who had once tasted the sweets of its attendant
liberty and freedom from every worldly care, not
regretting the moment when he exchanged it
for the monotonous life of the settlements, nor
sighing and sighing again once more to partake
of its pleasures and allurements.”</p>

<p>To this class of voluntary wanderers belong
those who <i>take</i> to the streets, glad to exchange
the wearisomeness and restraint of a settled occupation
for the greater freedom and license of a
nomad mode of life. As a class, they are essentially
the non-working, preferring, as I said
before, to <i>collect</i>, rather than <i>produce</i>, what they
eat. If they sell, they do so because for sundry
reasons they fear to infringe the law, and as
traders their transactions certainly are not
marked by an excess of honesty. I am not
aware that any of them are professional thieves
(for these are the more daring portion of the
same vagrant fraternity), though the majority
assuredly are habitual cheats&mdash;delighting in
proving their cleverness by imposing upon
simple-minded citizens&mdash;viewing all society as
composed of the same dishonest elements as
their own tribes, and looking upon all sympathy
and sacrifice, even when made for their own
benefit, as some “artful dodge” or trick, by
which to snare them.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, however, that there
are many grades of vagrants among us, and
that though they are all essentially non-producing
and, consequently, predatory, still many
are in no way distinguished from a large portion
of even our wealthy tradesmen&mdash;our puffing
grocers and slopsellers. To attempt to improve
the condition of the voluntary street-sellers by
teaching of any kind, would be to talk to the
wind. We might as well preach to Messrs.
Moses, Nicol, and Co., in the hope of Christianising
them. Those who <i>take</i> to the streets are
<i>not</i>, like those who are <i>bred</i> to it, an uneducated
class. They are intelligent and “knowing”
enough, and it is this development of their intellect
at the expense of their conscience which
gives rise to that excessive admiration of mere
cleverness, which makes skill the sole standard
of excellence with them. They approve, admire,
venerate nothing but what is ingenious. Wrong
with them is mere folly&mdash;right, cunning; and
those who think the simple cultivation of the
intellect the great social panacea of the time,
have merely to study the characteristics of this
class to see how a certain style of education can
breed the very vice it seeks to destroy. Years
ago, I wrote and printed the following passage,
and every year since my studies have convinced
me more and more of its truth:</p>

<p>“Man, if deprived of his intellect, would be
the most miserable and destitute,&mdash;if of his
sympathy, the most savage and cunning, of all
the brute creation: consequently, we may infer
that, according as solely the one or the other of
these powers is expanded in us, so shall we approximate
in our nature either to the instinct of
the brute or to the artifice of the demon, and
that only when they are developed in an equal
degree, can Man be said to be educated as Man.
We should remember that the intellect simply
executes; it is either the selfish or moral propensity
that designs. The intellectual principle
enables us to perceive the means of attaining
any particular object; it is the selfish or else
the moral principle in us, that causes us originally
to desire that object. The two latter principles
are the springs, the former is merely the
instrument of all human action. They are
masters, whereas the intellect is but the servant
of the will; and hence it is evident that in proportion
as the one or the other of these two
predominant principles&mdash;as either the selfish or
the moral disposition is educed in man, and thus
made the chief director and stimulus of the
intellectual power within him, so will the cultivation
of that power be the source of happiness
or misery to himself and others.”</p>

<p>The third and last class, namely, those who
are <i>driven</i> to the streets, is almost as large as
any. Luckily, those who <i>take</i> to that mode of
life, are by far the least numerous portion of
the street-folk; and if those who are bred to the
business are worthy of our pity, assuredly those
who are driven to it are equally, if not more, so.
With some who are deprived of the means of
obtaining a maintenance for themselves, the sale
of small articles in the streets may, perhaps, be
an excuse for begging; but in most cases, I am
convinced it is adopted from a horror of the
workhouse, and a disposition to do, at least, <i>something</i>
for the food they eat. Often is it the last
struggle of independence&mdash;the desire to give
something like an equivalent for what they receive.
Over and over again have I noticed this
honourable pride, even in individuals who, from
some privations or affliction that rendered them
utterly incompetent to labour for their living,
had a just claim on our sympathies and assistance.
The blind&mdash;the cripple&mdash;the maimed&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
very old&mdash;the very young&mdash;all have generally
adopted a street-life, because they could
do nothing else. With many it is the last resort
of all. The smallness of the stock-money required&mdash;for
a shilling, it has been shown, is
sufficient to commence several street-trades&mdash;is
one of the principal causes of so many of those
who are helpless taking to the street-traffic.
Moreover, the severity of the Poor-laws and
the degradation of pauperism, and the aversion
to be thought a common beggar by all, except
the very lowest, are, I have no doubt, strong
incentives to this course. There are many callings
which are peculiar, as being followed principally
by the disabled. The majority of the
blind are musicians, or boot-lace or tape-sellers.
The very old are sellers of watercresses,
lucifers, pincushions, ballads, and pins
and needles, stay-laces, and such small articles
as are light to carry, and require but a few
pence for the outlay. The very young are
sellers of flowers, oranges, nuts, onions, blacking,
lucifers, and the like. Many of those
who have lost an arm, or a leg, or a hand, turn
showmen, or become sellers of small metal
articles, as knives or nutmeg-graters; and many
who have been born cripples may be seen in the
streets struggling for self-support. But all who
are <i>driven</i> to the streets have not been physically
<i>disabled</i> for labour. Some have been
<i>reduced</i> from their position as tradesmen or
shopmen; others, again, have been gentlemen’s
servants and clerks; all, dragged down by a series
of misfortunes, sometimes beyond their control,
and sometimes brought about by their own
imprudence or sluggishness. As we have seen,
many are reduced to a state of poverty by long
illness, and on their recovery are unable, from
want of clothes or friends, to follow any other
occupation.</p>

<p>But a still larger class than all, are the
beaten-out mechanics and artizans, who, from
want of employment in their own trade, take to
make up small things (as clothes-horses, tin-ware,
cutlery, brushes, pails, caps, and bonnets)
on their own account. The number of artizans
in the London streets speaks volumes for the independence
of the working-men of this country;
as well as for the difficulty of their obtaining
employment at their own trades. Those who
are unacquainted with the sterling pride of the
destitute English mechanic, know not what he
will suffer before becoming an inmate of a
workhouse, or sinking to the debasement of a
beggar. That handicraftsmen do occasionally
pass into “lurkers” I know well; but these, I
am convinced, have gradually been warped to
the life by a long course of tramping, aided by
the funds of their societies, and thus becoming
disused to labour, have, after forfeiting all claims
upon the funds of their trade, adopted beggary
as a means of subsistence. But, that this is the
exception rather than the rule, the following is
sufficient to show:</p>

<p>“The destitute mechanics,” said the Master
of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union to me,
“are entirely a different class from the regular
vagrants; they have different habits, and indeed
different features. During the whole of my experience
I never knew a distressed artizan who
applied for a night’s shelter, commit an act of
theft; and I have seen them,” he added, “in
the last stage of destitution. Occasionally
they have sold the shirt and waistcoat off their
backs before they applied for admittance into
the workhouse, while some of them have been
so weak from long starvation that they could
scarcely reach the gate, and indeed had to be
kept for several days in the Infirmary before
their strength was recruited sufficiently to continue
their journey.” “The poor mechanic,”
said another of my informants, “will sit in the
casual ward like a lost man, scared. It’s shocking
to think a decent mechanic’s houseless.
When he’s beat out he’s like a bird out of a
cage; he doesn’t know where to go, or how to
get a bit.”</p>

<p>I shall avail myself of another occasion to
discuss the means of improving the condition
of the street-people.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_MANUFACTURED_ARTICLES"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.</h2>
</div>


<p>These traders consist of: (1) The vendors of
metal articles; (2) Of chemical articles; (3)
Of China, glass, and stone articles; (4) Of
linen, cotton, and other textile fabrics; and (5)
Of miscellaneous articles. In this classification
I do not include second-hand articles, nor
yet the traffic of those who make the articles
they sell, and who are indeed street-artizans
rather than street-sellers.</p>

<p>Under the first head are included, the vendors
of razors, table and penknives, tea-trays, dog-collars,
key-rings, articles of hardware, small
coins and medals, pins and needles, jewellery,
snuffers, candlesticks, articles of tin-ware, tools,
card-counters, herring-toasters, trivets, gridirons,
pans, tray-stands (as in the roasting of meat),
and Dutch ovens.</p>

<p>Of the second description are the vendors of
blacking, black-lead, lucifer matches, corn-salves,
grease-removing compositions, china
and glass cements, plating-balls, rat and beetle
poisons, crackers, detonating-balls, and cigar-lights.</p>

<p>Under the third head come all street-sold
articles of China, glass, or stone manufacture,
including not only “crockery,” but vases,
chimney-ornaments, and stone fruit.</p>

<p>The fourth head presents the street-vending
of cotton, silken, and linen-manufactures; such
as sheetings, shirtings, a variety of laces, sew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>ing
cotton, threads and tapes, articles of haberdashery
and of millinery, artificial flowers,
handkerchiefs, and pretended smuggled goods.</p>

<p>Among the fifth class, or the “miscellaneous”
street-sellers, are those who vend cigars, pipes,
tobacco and snuff-boxes and cigar-cases, accordions,
spectacles, hats, sponge, combs and hair-brushes,
shirt-buttons and coat-studs, “lots,”
rhubarb, wash-leather, paper-hangings, dolls,
Bristol and other toys, saw-dust, fire-wood,
and pin-cushions.</p>

<p>There are many other manufactured articles
sold in the streets, but their description will be
more proper under the head of Street Artisans.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of manufactured articles
present, as a body, so many and often such
varying characteristics, that I cannot offer to
give a description of them as a whole, as I
have been able to do with other and less diversified
classes.</p>

<p>Among them are several distinct and peculiar
street-characters, such as the pack-men, who
carry their cotton or linen goods in packs on
their backs, and are all itinerants. Then there
are duffers, who vend pretended smuggled goods,
handkerchiefs, silks, tobacco or cigars; also, the
sellers of sham sovereigns and sham gold rings
for wagers. The crockery-ware and glass-sellers
(known in the street-trade as “crocks”), are
peculiar from their principle of <i>bartering</i>. They
will sell to any one, but they <i>sell</i> very rarely,
and always clamour in preference for an exchange
of their wares for wearing-apparel of
any kind. They state, if questioned, that their
reason for doing this is&mdash;at least I heard the
statement from some of the most intelligent
among them&mdash;that they do so because, if they
“sold outright,” they required a hawker’s
license, and could not sell or “swop” so
cheap.</p>

<p>Some of the street-sellers of manufactured
articles are also patterers. Among these are
the “cheap Jacks,” or “cheap Johns;” the
grease and stain removers; the corn-salve and
plate-ball vendors; the sellers of sovereigns
and rings for wagers; a portion of the lot-sellers;
and the men who vend poison for
vermin and go about the streets with live rats
clinging to, or running about, their persons.</p>

<p>This class of street-sellers also includes many
of the very old and the very young; the diseased,
crippled, maimed, and blind. These poor creatures
sell, and sometimes obtain a charitable
penny, by offering to sell such things as boxes of
lucifer-matches; cakes of blacking; boot, stay,
and other laces; pins, and sewing and knitting-needles;
tapes; cotton-bobbins; garters;
pincushions; combs; nutmeg-graters; metal
skewers and meat-hooks; hooks and eyes; and
shirt-buttons.</p>

<p>The rest of the class may be described as
merely street-sellers; toiling, struggling, plodding,
itinerant tradesmen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Manufactured
Articles in Metal.</span></h3>

<p>These street-sellers are less numerous than
might be imagined, when&mdash;according to my
present division&mdash;the class is confined to the
sellers of articles which they do not manufacture.
The metal wares thus sold I have already enumerated,
and I have now to describe the characteristics
of the sellers.</p>

<p>The result of my inquiries leads me to the
conclusion, that the street-vendors of any article
which is the product of the skill of the handicraftsman,
have been, almost always, in their
first outset in a street life, connected in some
capacity or other with the trade, the manufactures
of which they vend.</p>

<p>One elderly man, long familiar with this
branch of the street-trade, expressed to me his
conviction that when a mechanic sought his
livelihood in the streets, he naturally “gave his
mind to sell what he understood. Now, in my
own case,” continued my informant, “I was
born and bred a tinman, and when I was driven
to a street-life, I never thought of selling anything
but tins. How could I, if I wished to do
the thing square and proper?&mdash;it would be like
trying to speak another language. If I’d started
on slippers&mdash;and I knew a poor man who was
set up in the streets by a charitable lady on a
stock of gentlemen’s slippers&mdash;what could I
have done? Why, no better than he told me he
did. He was a potter down at Deptford, and
knew of nothing but flower-pots, and honey-jars
for grocers, and them red sorts of pottery.
Poor fellow, he might have died of hunger,
only the cholera came quickest. But when
I’m questioned about my tins, I’m my own
man; and it’s a great thing, I’m satisfied, in a
street-trade, when there’s so many cheap shops,
and the police and all again you, to understand
the goods you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>This statement, I may repeat, is undoubtedly
correct, so far as that a “beaten-out” mechanic,
when driven to the streets, in the first instance
offers to the public wares of which he understands
the value and quality. Afterwards, in
the experience or vagaries of a street-life, other
commodities may be, or may appear to be, more
remunerative, and for such the mechanic may
relinquish his first articles of street-traffic.
“Why, sir,” I was told, “there was one man
who left razors for cabbages; ’cause one day a
costermonger wot lived in the same house with
him and was taken ill, asked him to go out with
a barrow of summer cabbages&mdash;the costermonger’s
boy went with him&mdash;and they went off so
well that Joe [the former razor-seller] managed
to start in the costering line, he was so encouraged.”</p>

<p>The street-trade in metal manufactured articles
is principally itinerant. Perhaps during
the week upwards of three-fourths of those
carrying it on are itinerant, while on a Saturday
night, perhaps, all are stationary, and almost
always in the street-markets. The itinerant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
trade is carried on, and chiefly in the suburbs,
by men, women, and children; but the children
are always, or almost always, the offspring of
the adult street-sellers.</p>

<p>The metal sold in the street may be divided
into street-hardware, street-tinware, and street-jewellery.
I shall begin with the former.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of hardware are, I am assured,
in number about 100, including single
men and families; for women “take their share”
in the business, and children sell smaller things,
such as snuffers or bread-baskets. The people
pursuing the trade are of the class I have above
described, with the exception of some ten or
twelve who formerly made a living as servants
to the gaming-booths at Epsom, Ascot, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and “managed to live out of the races, somehow,
most of the year;” since the gaming-booths
have been disallowed, they have “taken to the
street hardware.”</p>

<p>All these street-sellers obtain their supplies
at “the swag-shops;” of which I shall speak
hereafter. The main articles of their trade are
tea-boards, waiters, snuffers, candlesticks, bread-baskets,
cheese-trays, Britannia metal tea-pots
and spoons, iron kettles, pans, and coffee-pots.
The most saleable things, I am told by a man
who has been fifteen years in this and similar
street trades, are at present 18-in. tea-boards,
bought at “the swags” at from 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a doz.,
to 4<i>s.</i> each; 24-in. boards, from 20<i>s.</i> the doz. to
5<i>s.</i> each; bread-baskets, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the doz.; and
Britannia metal tea-pots, 10<i>s.</i> the doz. These
tea-pots have generally what is called “loaded
bottoms;” the lower part of the vessel is “filled
with composition, so as to look as if there was
great weight of metal, and as if the pot would
melt for almost the 18<i>d.</i> which is asked for it,
and very often got.”</p>

<p>I learned from the same man, however, and
from others in the trade, that it is far more difficult
now than it was a few years ago, to sell
“rubbish.” There used to be also, but not
within these six or eight years, a tolerable profit
realised by the street-sellers of hardware in the
way of “swop.” It was common to take an old
metal article, as part payment for a new one;
and if the old article were of good quality, it
was polished and tinkered up for sale in the
Saturday evening street-markets, and often
“went off well.” This traffic, however, has
almost ceased to exist, as regards the street-sellers
of hardware, and has been all but monopolised
by the men who barter “crocks” for
wearing-apparel, or any old metal. Some hardware-men
who have become well known on their
“rounds”&mdash;for the principal trade is in the suburbs&mdash;sell
very good wares, and at moderate profits.</p>

<p>“It’s a poor trade, sir, is the hardware,” said
one man carrying it on, “and street trades are
mostly poor trades, for I’ve tried many a one of
them. I was brought up a clown, I may say;
my father died when I was a child, and I might
have been a clown still but for an accident (a
rupture). That’s long ago,&mdash;I can’t say how
long; but I know that before I was fifteen, I
many a time wished I was dead, and I have
many a time since. Why the day before yesterday,
from 9 in the morning to 11 at night, I
didn’t take a farthing. Some days I don’t
earn 1<i>s.</i>, and I have a mother depending upon
me who can do little or nothing. I’m a teetotaller;
if I wasn’t we shouldn’t have a meal
a day. I never was fond of drink, and if I’m
ever so weary and out of sorts, and worried
for a meal’s meat, I can’t say I ever long for
a drop to cheer me up. Sometimes I can’t
get coffee, let alone anything else. O, I suffer
terribly. Day after day I get wet through,
and have nothing to take home to my mother at
last. Our principal food is bread and butter,
and tea. Not fish half so often as many poor
people. I suppose, because we don’t care for it.
I know that our living, the two of us, stands to
less than 1<i>s.</i> a day,&mdash;not 6<i>d.</i> a piece. Then I
have two rents to pay. No, sir, not for two
places; but I pay 2<i>s.</i> a week for a room, a tidy
bit of a chamber, furnished, and 1<i>s.</i> a week rent,&mdash;I
call it rent, for a loan of 5<i>s.</i> I’ve paid 1<i>s.</i> a
week for four weeks on it, and must keep paying
until I can hand over the 5<i>s.</i>, with 1<i>s.</i> for rent
added to it, all in one sum. If I could tip up
the 5<i>s.</i> the day after I’d paid the last week’s 1<i>s.</i>, I
must pay another shilling. The man who lends
does nothing else; he lives by lending, and by
letting out a few barrows to costermongers, and
other street-people. I wish I could take a
farewell sight of them.”</p>

<p>The principal traffic carried on by these
street-sellers is in the suburbs. Women constitute
their sole customers, or nearly so. Their
profits fluctuate from 20 per cent. to 100 per cent.
The bread-baskets, which they buy at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
doz., they retail at 6<i>d.</i> each; for it is very difficult,
I have frequently been told, to get a price between
6<i>d.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> This, however, relates only
to those things which are not articles of actual
necessity. Half of these street-sellers, I am
assured, take on an average from 20<i>s.</i> to 25<i>s.</i>
weekly the year through; a quarter take 15<i>s.</i>,
and the remaining quarter from 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>
Calculating an average taking of 15<i>s.</i> each per
week, throughout the entire class, men, women,
and children, we find 3,900<i>l.</i> expended in street-sold
hardwares. Ten years ago, I am told, the
takings were not less than 2,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The following is an extract from accounts
kept, not long ago, by a street-seller of hardware.
His principal sale was snuffers, knives
and forks, iron candlesticks, padlocks, and bed-screws.
His stock cost him 35<i>s.</i> on the Monday
morning, and his first week was his <i>best</i>, which
I here subjoin:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cheap Johns, or Street Hansellers.</span></h3>

<p>This class of street-salesmen, who are perhaps
the largest dealers of all in hardware, are not so
numerous as they were some few years ago&mdash;the
Excise Laws, as I have before remarked, having
interfered with their business. The principal
portion of those I have met are Irishmen, who,
notwithstanding, generally “hail” from Sheffield,
and all their sales are effected in an attempt
at the Yorkshire dialect, interspersed, however,
with an unmistakeable brogue. The brogue is
the more apparent when cheap John gets a little
out of temper&mdash;if his sales are flat, for instance,
he’ll say, “By J&mdash;s, I don’t belaive you’ve any
money with you, or that you’ve lift any at home,
at all, at all. Bad cess to you!”</p>

<p>There are, however, many English cheap
Johns, but few of them are natives of Sheffield
or Birmingham, from which towns they invariably
“hail.” Their system of selling is to
attract a crowd of persons by an harangue after
the following fashion: “Here I am, the original
cheap John from Sheffield. I’ve not come here
to get money; not I; I’ve come here merely
for the good of the public, and to let you see
how you’ve been imposed upon by a parcel of
pompous shopkeepers, who are not content with
less than 100 per cent. for rubbish. They got
up a petition&mdash;which I haven’t time to read to
you just now&mdash;offering me a large sum of money
to keep away from here. But no, I had too much
friendship for you to consent, and here I am,
cheap John, born without a shirt, one day while
my mother was out, in a haystack; consequently
I’ve no parish, for the cows eat up mine,
and therefore I’ve never no fear of going to the
workhouse. I’ve more money than the parson
of the parish&mdash;I’ve in this cart a cargo of useful
and cheap goods; can supply you with anything,
from a needle to an anchor. Nobody <i>can</i>
sell as cheap as me, seeing that I gets all my
goods upon credit, and never means to pay for
them. Now then, what shall we begin with?
Here’s a beautiful guard-chain; if it isn’t silver,
it’s the same colour&mdash;I don’t say it isn’t
silver, nor I don’t say it is&mdash;in that affair use
your own judgment. Now, in the reg’lar way
of trade, you shall go into any shop in town,
and they will ask you 1<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for an article
not half so good, so what will you say for this
splendid chain? Eighteen and sixpence without
the pound? What, that’s too much! Well,
then say 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 shillings;
what, none of you give ten shillings for this
beautiful article? See how it improves a man’s
appearance” (hanging the chain round his neck).
“Any young man here present wearing this chain
will always be shown into the parlour instead
of the tap-room; into the best pew in church,
when he and&mdash;but the advantages the purchaser
of this chain will possess I haven’t time to tell.
What! no buyers? Why, what’s the matter
with ye? Have you no money, or no brains?
But I’ll ruin myself for your sakes. Say 9<i>s.</i>
for this splendid piece of jewellery&mdash;8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1&mdash;a shilling, will anybody give a shilling?
Well, here 11<i>d.</i>, 10<i>d.</i>, 9<i>d.</i>, 8<i>d.</i>, 7<i>d.</i>, 6&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
6<i>d.</i>! Is there ever a buyer at sixpence? Now
I’ll ask no more and I’ll take no less; sell it or
never sell it.” The concluding words are spoken
with peculiar emphasis, and after saying them
the cheap John never takes any lower sum. A
customer perhaps is soon obtained for the guard-chain,
and then the vendor elevates his voice;
“Sold to a very respectable gentleman, with
his mouth between his nose and chin, a most
remarkable circumstance. I believe I’ve just
one more&mdash;this is better than the last; I must
have a shilling for this. Sixpence? To you,
sir. Sold again, to a gentleman worth 30,000<i>l.</i>
a year; only the right owner keeps him out
of it. I believe I’ve just one more; yes,
here it is; it’s brighterer, longerer, strongerer,
and betterer than the last. I must have at
least tenpence for this. Well then, 9, 8, 7, 6;
take this one for a sixpence. Sold again, to
a gentleman, his father’s pet and his mother’s
joy. Pray, sir, does your mother know you’re
out? Well, I don’t think I’ve any more, but
I’ll look; yes, here is <i>one</i> more. Now this
is better than all the rest. Sold again, to a
most respectable gentleman, whose mother keeps
a chandler’s shop, and whose father turns
the mangle.” In this manner the cheap John
continues to sell his guard-chain, until he has
drained his last customer for that particular
commodity. He has always his remark to make
relative to the purchaser. The cheap John
always takes care to receive payment before he
hazards his jokes, which I need scarcely remark
are ready made, and most of them ancient and
worn threadbare, the joint property of the whole
fraternity of cheap Johns. After supplying his
audience with one particular article, he introduces
another: “Here is a carving-knife and
fork, none of your wasters, capital buck-horn
handle, manufactured of the best steel, in a
regular workmanlike manner; fit for carving in
the best style, from a sparrow to a bullock. I
don’t ask 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for this&mdash;although go over to
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the ironmonger, and he will have the
impudence to ask you 15<i>s.</i> for a worse article.”
(The cheap Johns always make comparisons as
to their own prices and the shopkeepers, and
sometimes mention their names.) “I say 5<i>s.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
for the carving-knife and fork. Why, it’s an
article that’ll almost fill your children’s bellies
by looking at it, and will always make 1 lb. of
beef go as far as 6 lb. carved by any other knife
and fork. Well, 4<i>s.</i>, 3<i>s.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, 18<i>d.</i> I ask no more, nor
I’ll take no less.” The salesman throughout
his variety of articles indulges in the same jokes,
and holds out the same inducements. I give
a few.</p>

<p>“<i>This</i> is the original teapot” (producing
one), “formerly invented by the Chinese; the
first that ever was imported by those celebrated
people&mdash;only two of them came over in three
ships. If I do not sell this to-day, I intend
presenting it to the British Museum or the
Great Exhibition. It is mostly used for making
tea,&mdash;sometimes by ladies, for keeping a little
drop on the sly; it is an article constructed
upon scientific principles, considered to require
a lesser quantity of tea to manufacture the
largest quantity of tea-water, than any other
teapot now in use&mdash;largely patronised by the
tea-totallers. Now, here’s a fine pair of bellows!
Any of you want to raise the wind? This is a
capital opportunity, if you’ll try. I’ll tell you
how; buy these of me for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and go and
pawn them for 7<i>s.</i> Will you buy ’em, sir? No!
well, then, you be blowed! Let’s see&mdash;I said
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; it’s too little, but as I have said it, they
must go; well&mdash;3<i>s.</i>,” &amp;c. &amp;c. “Capital article
to chastise the children or a drunken husband.
Well, take ’em for 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;I ask no more, and I’ll
take no less.”</p>

<p>These men have several articles which they
sell singly, such as tea-trays, copper kettles,
fire-irons, guns, whips, to all of which they
have some preamble; but their most attractive
lot is a heap of miscellaneous articles:&mdash;“I
have here a pair of scissors; I only want half-a-crown
for them. What! you won’t give 1<i>s.</i>?
well, I’ll add something else. Here’s a most
useful article&mdash;a knife with eight blades, and
there’s not a blade among you all that’s more
highly polished. This knife’s a case of instruments
in addition to the blades; here’s a corkscrew,
a button-hook, a file, and a picker. For
this capital knife and first-rate pair of scissors
I ask 1<i>s.</i> Well, well, you’ve no more conscience
than a lawyer; here’s something else&mdash;a
pocket-book. This book no gentleman
should be without; it contains a diary for every
day in the week, an almanack, a ready-reckoner,
a tablet for your own memorandums, pockets to
keep your papers, and a splendid pencil with a
silver top. No buyers! I’m astonished; but
I’ll add another article. Here’s a pocket-comb.
No young man with any sense of decency
should be without a pocket-comb. What looks
worse than to see a man’s head in an uproar?
Some of you look as if your hair hadn’t seen a
comb for years. Surely I shall get a customer
now. What! no buyers&mdash;well I never! Here,
I’ll add half-a-dozen of the very best Britannia
metal tea-spoons, and if you don’t buy, you
must be spoons yourselves. Why, you perfectly
astonish me! I really believe if I was to offer
all in the shop, myself included, I should not
draw 1<i>s.</i> out of you. Well, I’ll try again.
Here, I’ll add a dozen of black-lead pencils.
Now, then, look at these articles”&mdash;(he spreads
them out, holding them between his fingers to
the best advantage)&mdash;“here’s a pair of first-rate
scissors, that will almost cut of themselves,&mdash;this
valuable knife, which comprises within
itself almost a chest of tools,&mdash;a splendid pocket-book,
which must add to the respectability and
consequence of any man who wears it,&mdash;a pocket-comb
which possesses the peculiar property of
making the hair curl, and dyeing it any colour
you wish,&mdash;a half-dozen spoons, nothing inferior
to silver, and that do not require half the usual
quantity of sugar to sweeten your tea,&mdash;and a
dozen beautiful pencils, at least worth the
money I ask for the whole lot. Now, a
reasonable price for these articles would be
at least 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; I’ll sell them for 1<i>s.</i> I ask
no more, I’ll take no less. Sold again!”</p>

<p>The opposition these men display to each
other, while pursuing their business, is mostly
assumed, for the purpose of attracting a crowd.
Sometimes, when in earnest, their language is
disgusting; and I have seen them, (says an informant),
after selling, try and settle their differences
with a game at fisticuffs: but this occurred
but seldom. One of these men had a wife who
used to sell for him,&mdash;she was considered to be
the best “chaffer” on the road; not one of them
could stand against her tongue: but her language
abounded with obscenity. All the “cheap
Johns” were afraid of her.</p>

<p>They never under-sell each other (unless they
get in a real passion); this but seldom happens,
but when it does they are exceedingly bitter
against each other. I cannot state the language
they use, further than that it reaches the very
summit of blackguardism. They have, however,
assumed quarrels, for the purpose of holding a
crowd together, and chaff goes round, intended
to amuse their expected customers.</p>

<p>“He’s coming your way to-morrow,” they’ll
say one of the other, “mind and don’t hang
your husbands’ shirts to dry, ladies, he’s very
lucky at finding things before they’re lost; he
sells very cheap, no doubt&mdash;but mind, if you
handle any of his wares, he don’t make you a
present of a Scotch fiddle for nothing. His
hair looks as if it had been cut with a knife and
fork.”</p>

<p>The Irishmen, in these displays, generally
have the best of it; indeed, most of their jokes
have originated with the Irishmen, who complain
of the piracies of other “cheap Johns,” for as
soon as the joke is uttered it is the property of
the commonwealth, and not unfrequently used
against the inventor half an hour after its first
appearance.</p>

<p>A few of them are not over particular as to
the respectability of their transactions. I recollect
one purchasing a brick at Sheffield; the
brick was packed up in paper, with a knife tied
on the outside, it appeared like a package of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
knives, containing several dozens. The “cheap
John” made out that he bought them as stolen
property; the biter was deservedly bitten. A
few of the fraternity are well-known “Fences,”
and some of them pursue the double calling of
“cheap John” and gambler&mdash;keeping gambling
tables at races. However the majority are
hard-working men, who unite untiring industry
with the most indomitable perseverance, for the
laudable purpose of bettering their condition.</p>

<p>I believe the most successful in the line have
worked their way up from nothing, gaining experience
as they proceeded. I have known two
or three start the trade with plenty of stock, but,
wanting the tact, they have soon been knocked
off the road. There is a great deal of judgment
required in knowing the best fairs, and even
when there, as to getting a good stand; and
these matters are to be acquired only by practice.</p>

<p>In the provinces, and in Scotland, there may
be 100 “cheap Johns,” or, as they term themselves,
“Han-sellers.” They are generally a most
persevering body of men, and have frequently
risen from small hawkers of belts, braces, &amp;c.
Their receipts are from 5<i>l.</i> to 30<i>l.</i> per day, their
profits from 20 to 25 per cent.; 20<i>l.</i> is considered
a good day’s work; and they can take
about three fairs a week during the summer
months. “I have known many of these men,”
a man well acquainted with them informs me,
“who would walk 20 miles to a fair during the
night, hawk the public-houses the whole of the
day, and start again all night for a fair to be
held 20 miles off upon the following day. I
knew two Irish lads, named &mdash;&mdash;, and I watched
their progress with some interest. Each had
a stock of goods worth a few shillings; and
now each has a wholesale warehouse,&mdash;one at
Sheffield, in the cutlery line, and the other at
Birmingham, in general wares.”</p>

<p>The goods the han-seller disposes of are mostly
purchased at Sheffield and Birmingham. They
purchase the cheapest goods they can obtain.
Many of the han-sellers have settled in various
parts of England as “swag-shop keepers.” There
are two or three in London, I am told, who have
done so; one in the Kent-road, a large concern,&mdash;the
others I am not aware of their locality.
Their mode of living while travelling is rather
peculiar. Those who have their caravans, sleep
in them, some with their wives and families; they
have a man, or more generally a boy, to look
after the horse, and other drudgery, and sometimes
at a fair, to hawk, or act as a <i>button</i>
(a <i>decoy</i>), to purchase the first lot of goods put
up. This boy is accommodated with a bed made
between the wheels of the cart or wagon, with
some old canvas hung round to keep the weather
out&mdash;not the most comfortable quarters, perhaps,&mdash;but,
as they say, “it’s nothing when you’re
used to it.” The packing up occurs when
there’s no more chance of effecting sales; the
horse is put to, and the caravan proceeds on
the road towards the next town intended to visit.
After a sufficient days’ travel, the “cheap
John” looks out for a spot to encamp for the
night. A clear stream of water, and provender
for the horse, are indispensable; or perhaps the
han-seller has visited that part before, and is
aware of the halting-place. After having released
the horse, and secured his fore-feet, so
that he cannot stray, the next process is to look
for some <i>crack</i> (some dry wood to light a fire);
this is the boy’s work. He is told not to despoil
hedges, or damage fences: “cheap John” doesn’t
wish to offend the farmers; and during his temporary
sojourn in the green lanes, he frequently
has some friendly chat with the yeomen and
their servants, sometimes disposes of goods, and
often barters for a piece of fat bacon or potatoes.
A fire is lighted between the shafts of the cart,&mdash;a
stick placed across, upon which is suspended
the cookery utensil. When the meal is concluded,
the parties retire to bed,&mdash;the master
within the caravan, and the boy to his chamber
between the wheels. Sometimes they breakfast
before they proceed on their journey; at other
times they travel a few miles first.</p>

<p>Those who have children bring them up in
such a manner as may be imagined considering
their itinerant life: but there are very
few who have families travelling with them;
though in most cases a wife; generally the
children of the “cheap John” are stationary,
either out at nurse or with relatives.</p>

<p>Some of the “cheap Johns” have wagons
upon four wheels, others have carts; but both
are fitted up with a wooden roof. The proprietor
invariably sleeps within his portable house,
both for the protection of his property and also
upon the score of economy. The vans with
four wheels answer all the purposes of a habitation.
The furniture consists of a bed placed
upon boxes, containing the stock in trade. The
bed extends the whole width of the vehicle,
about 6 ft. 6 in., and many generally extend about
5 ft. into the body of the van, and occupies the
farthest end of the machine from the door,&mdash;which
door opens out upon the horse. The
four-wheeled vans are 12 ft. long, and the two-wheeled
carts 9 ft. During business hours the
whole of the articles most likely to be wanted
are spread out upon the bed, and the assistant
(either the wife or a boy) hands them out as the
salesman may require them. The furniture, in
addition to the bed, is very scarce; indeed they
are very much averse to carry more than is really
necessary. The pail, the horse takes his corn and
beans from (I don’t know why, but they never
use nose-bags,) serves the purpose of a wash-hand
basin or a washing-tub. It is generally
painted the same colour as the van, with the
initials of the proprietor painted upon it, and,
when travelling, hangs upon a hook under the
machine. They mostly begin with a two-wheeled
machine, and if successful a four-wheeler
follows. The tables and chairs are the
boxes in which the goods are packed. A tea-kettle
and saucepan, and as few delf articles
as possible, and corner-cupboard, and these
comprise the whole of the furniture of the van.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
In the four-wheeled wagons there is always a
fire-place similar to those the captains of ships
have in their cabins, but in the two-wheeled
carts fire-places are dispensed with. These are
mostly brass ones, and are kept very bright;
for the “cheap Johns” are proud of their van
and its contents. They are always gaudily
painted, sometimes expensively; indeed they
are most expensive articles, and cost from 80<i>l.</i>
to 120<i>l.</i> The principal person for making
these machines is a Mr. Davidson of Leeds.
The showman’s caravans are still more expensive;
the last purchased by the late Mr.
Wombwell cost more than 300<i>l.</i>, and is really a
curiosity. He termed it, as all showmen do&mdash;the
living wagon; viz. to live in&mdash;it has parlour
and kitchen, and is fitted up most handsomely;
its exterior presents the appearance of
a first-class railway-carriage. The front exterior
of the van during the trading operations of the
“cheap Johns,” is hung round with guns, saws,
tea-trays, bridles, whips, centre-bits, and other
articles, displayed to the best advantage. The
name of the proprietor is always prominently
displayed along the whole side of the vehicle,
added to which is a signification that he is a
wholesale hardwareman, from Sheffield, Yorkshire,
or Birmingham, Warwickshire, and sometimes
an extra announcement.</p>


<p class="center">“<i>The original cheap John.</i>”</p>

<p>I do not know any class of men who are
more fond of the good things of this life than
“cheap John;” his dinner, during a fair, is
generally eaten upon the platform outside his
van, where he disposes of his wares, and invariably
consists of a joint of baked meat and
potatoes&mdash;that is where they can get a dinner
baked. As little time as possible is occupied
in eating, especially if trade is good. At a hill
fair (that is where the fair is held upon a hill
away from a town), a fire is made behind the
cart, the pot is suspended upon three sticks,
and dinner prepared in the usual camp
fashion. The wife or boy superintends this.
Tea and coffee also generally find their way to
their table; and if there’s no cold meat a plentiful
supply of bacon, beef-steaks, eggs, or something
in the shape of a relish, seem to be with
“cheap John” indispensable. His man or
boy (if John is unmarried) appears to be upon
an equality with the master in the eating department;
he is not allowanced, neither has he to
wait until his superior has finished. Get it over
as quick as you can seems to be the chief object.
Perhaps from the circumstance of their
selling guns, and consequently always having
such implements in their possession, these men,
when they have time on their hands, are fond of
the sports of the field, and many a hare finds
its way into the camp-kettle of “cheap John.”
I need not say that they practise this sport with
but little respectful feeling towards the Game-laws;
but they are careful when indulging in
such amusement, and I never heard of one getting
into a hobble.</p>

<p>During the winter (since the “cheap John”
has been obliged to become a licensed auctioneer),
some of them take shops and sell their
goods by auction, or get up mock-auctions. I
have been told by them that sometimes its a
better game than “han-selling.”</p>

<p>The commencement of the “cheap John’s”
season is at Lynn in Norfolk; there is a mart
there commencing 14th February, it continues
fourteen days. After this, there is Wisbeach,
Spalding, Grantham, and other marts in Norfolk
and Lincolnshire; which bring them up to
Easter. At Easter there are many fairs&mdash;Manchester,
Knott Mill, Blackburn, Darlington,
Newcastle, &amp;c., &amp;c. The “cheap Johns” then
disperse themselves through different parts of
the country. Hill-fairs are considered the best;
that is cattle-fairs, where there are plenty of
farmers and country people. Hirings for servants
are next to them. It may appear curious,
but Sheffield and Birmingham fairs are two of
the best for the “cheap John’s” business in
England. There are two fairs at each place
during the year. Sheffield, at Whitsuntide and
November; Birmingham, Whitsuntide and
September. Nottingham, Derby, Leeds, Newcastle,
Bristol, Glasgow&mdash;in fact, where the
greatest population is, the chances for business
are considered the best, and if I may judge
from the number of traders in this line, who
attend the largest towns, I should say they succeed
better than in smaller towns.</p>

<p>If we calculate that there are 100 “cheap
Johns” in London and in the country, and they
are more or less itinerant, and that they each
take 4<i>l.</i> per day for nine months in the year, or
24<i>l.</i> per week; this amounts to 2,400<i>l.</i> per week,
or about 90,000<i>l.</i> in nine months. Supposing
their profits to be 20 per cent., it would leave
18,000<i>l.</i> clear income. Say that during the
winter there are seventy-five following the business,
and that their receipts amount to 15<i>l.</i> each
per week, this amounts to 13,500<i>l.</i> additional;
and, at the rate of 20 per cent. profit, comes
to 2,700<i>l.</i>,&mdash;making throughout the year the
profits of the 100 “cheap Johns” 20,700<i>l.</i>, or
207<i>l.</i> a man.</p>

<p>The “cheap Johns” seldom frequent the
crowded thoroughfares of London. Their usual
pitches in the metropolis are, King’s-cross, St.
George’s-in-the-East, Stepney, round about the
London Docks, Paddington, Kennington, and
such like places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Crippled Street-seller of Nutmeg-graters.</span></h3>

<p>I now give an example of one of the classes
<i>driven</i> to the streets by utter inability to labour.
I have already spoken of the sterling independence
of some of these men possessing the
strongest claims to our sympathy and charity,
and yet preferring to <i>sell</i> rather than <i>beg</i>. As I
said before, many ingrained beggars certainly use
the street <i>trade</i> as a cloak for alms-seeking, but
as certainly many more, with every title to our
assistance, use it as a means of redemption from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
beggary. That the nutmeg-grater seller is a
noble example of the latter class, I have not the
least doubt. I have made all due inquiries to
satisfy myself as to his worthiness, and I feel convinced
that when the reader looks at the portrait
here given, and observes how utterly helpless the
poor fellow is, and then reads the following plain
unvarnished tale, he will marvel like me, not only
at the fortitude which could sustain him under all
his heavy afflictions, but at the resignation (not to
say philosophy) with which he bears them every
one. His struggles to earn his own living (notwithstanding
his physical incapacity even to put
the victuals to his mouth after he has earned
them), are instances of a nobility of pride that
are I believe without a parallel. The poor
creature’s legs and arms are completely withered;
indeed he is scarcely more than head and trunk.
His thigh is hardly thicker than a child’s wrist.
His hands are bent inward from contraction of
the sinews, the fingers being curled up and almost
as thin as the claws of a bird’s foot. He
is unable even to stand, and cannot move from
place to place but on his knees, which are shod
with leather caps, like the heels of a clog, strapped
round the joint; the soles of his boots are
on the <i>upper</i> leathers, that being the part always
turned towards the ground while he is crawling
along. His countenance is rather handsome
than otherwise; the intelligence indicated by his
ample forehead is fully borne out by the testimony
as to his sagacity in his business, and the mild
expression of his eye by the statements as to his
feeling for all others in affliction.</p>

<p>“I sell nutmeg-graters and funnels,” said the
cripple to me; “I sell them at 1<i>d.</i> and 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a
piece. I get mine of the man in whose house I
live. He is a tinman, and makes for the street-trade
and shops and all. I pay 7<i>d.</i> a dozen for
them, and I get 12<i>d.</i> or 18<i>d.</i> a dozen, if I can
when I sell them, but I mostly get only a penny
a piece&mdash;it’s quite a chance if I have a customer
at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> Some days I sell only three&mdash;some days
not one&mdash;though I’m out from ten o’clock till six.
The most I ever took was 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in a day. Some
weeks I hardly clear my expenses&mdash;and they’re
between 7<i>s.</i> and 8<i>s.</i> a week; for not being able to
dress and ondress myself, I’m obligated to pay
some one to do it for me&mdash;I think I don’t clear
more than 7<i>s.</i> a week take one week with another.
When I don’t make that much, I go without&mdash;sometimes
friends who are kind to me give me
a trifle, or else I should starve. As near as I
can judge, I <i>take</i> about 15<i>s.</i> a week, and out of
that I clear about 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i> I pay for my
meals as I have them&mdash;3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> a meal. I
pay every night for my lodging as I go in, if
I can; but if not my landlady lets it run a
night or two. I give her 1<i>s.</i> a week for my
washing and looking after me, and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
my lodging. When I do very well I have
three meals a day, but it’s oftener only two&mdash;breakfast
and supper&mdash;unless of Sunday. On
a wet day when I can’t get out, I often go
without food. I may have a bit of bread and
butter give me, but that’s all&mdash;then I lie a-bed.
I feel miserable enough when I see the rain
come down of a week day, I can tell you. Ah,
it <i>is</i> very miserable indeed lying in bed all
day, and in a lonely room, without perhaps a
person to come near one&mdash;helpless as I am&mdash;and
hear the rain beat against the windows, and
all that without nothing to put in your lips.
I’ve done <i>that</i> over and over again where I
lived before; but where I am now I’m more
comfortable like. My breakfast is mostly bread
and butter and tea; and my supper, bread and
butter and tea with a bit of fish, or a small bit
of meat. What my landlord and landlady has
I share with them. I never break my fast from
the time I go out in the morning till I come
home&mdash;unless it is a halfpenny orange I buy in
the street; I do that when I feel faint. I have
only been selling in the streets since this last
winter. I was in the workhouse with a fever
all the summer. I was destitute afterwards, and
obliged to begin selling in the streets. The
Guardians gave me 5<i>s.</i> to get stock. I had
always dealt in tin ware, so I knew where to go
to buy my things. It’s very hard work indeed
is street-selling for such as me. I can’t walk
no distance. I suffer a great deal of pains in my
back and knees. Sometimes I go in a barrow,
when I’m travelling any great way. When
I go only a short way I crawl along on my
knees and toes. The most I’ve ever crawled is
two miles. When I get home afterwards, I’m
in great pain. My knees swell dreadfully, and
they’re all covered with blisters, and my toes
ache awful. I’ve corns all on top of them.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]
</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Often after I’ve been walking, my limbs and
back ache so badly that I can get no sleep.
Across my lines it feels as if I’d got some great
weight, and my knees are in a heat, and throb,
and feel as if a knife was running into them.
When I go up-stairs I have to crawl upon the
back of my hands and my knees. I can’t lift
nothing to my mouth. The sinews of my hands
is all contracted. I am obliged to have things
held to my lip for me to drink, like a child. I
<i>can</i> use a knife and fork by leaning my arm on
the table and then stooping my head to it. I
can’t wash nor ondress myself. Sometimes I
think of my helplessness a great deal. The
thoughts of it used to throw me into fits at one
time&mdash;very bad. It’s the Almighty’s will that
I am so, and I must abide by it. People says, as
they passes me in the streets, ‘Poor fellow, it’s
a shocking thing;’ but very seldom they does
any more than pity me; some lays out a halfpenny
or a penny with me, but the most of ’em
goes on about their business. Persons looks at
me a good bit when I go into a strange place.
I <i>do</i> feel it very much, that I haven’t the power
to get my living or to do a thing for myself, but
I never begged for nothing. I’d sooner starve
than I’d do that. I never thought that people
whom God had given the power to help theirselves
ought to help me. I <i>have</i> thought that
I’m as I am&mdash;obliged to go on my hands and
knees, from no fault of my own. Often I’ve
done that, and I’ve over and over again laid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
bed and wondered why the Almighty should
send me into the world in such a state; often
I’ve done that on a wet day, with nothing to
eat, and no friend to come a-nigh me. When
I’ve gone along the streets, too, and been in
pain, I’ve thought, as I’ve seen the people pass
straight up, with all the use of their limbs, and
some of them the biggest blackguards, cussing
and swearing, I’ve thought, Why should I be
deprived of the use of mine? and I’ve felt angry
like, and perhaps at that moment I couldn’t
bring my mind to believe the Almighty was so
good and merciful as I’d heard say; but then
in a minute or two afterwards I’ve prayed to
Him to make me better and happier in the next
world. I’ve always been led to think He’s
afflicted me as He has for some wise purpose or
another that I can’t see. I think as mine is so
hard a life in this world, I shall be better off in
the next. Often when I couldn’t afford to pay a
boy, I’ve not had my boots off for four or five
nights and days, nor my clothes neither. Give
me the world I couldn’t take them off myself,
and then my feet has swollen to that degree
that I’ve been nearly mad with pain, and I’ve
been shivering and faint, but still I was obliged
to go out with my things; if I hadn’t I should
have starved. Such as I am can’t afford to
be ill&mdash;it’s only rich folks as can lay up, not
we; for us to take to our beds is to go without
food altogether. When I was without
never a boy, I used to tie the wet towel round
the back of one of the chairs, and wash myself
by rubbing my face up against it. I’ve been
two days without a bit of anything passing
between my lips. I couldn’t go and beg for
victuals&mdash;I’d rather go without. Then I used
to feel faint, and my head used to ache dreadful.
I used then to drink a plenty of water. The
women sex is mostly more kinder to me than
the men. Some of the men fancies, as I goes
along, that I can walk. They often says to me,
‘Why, the sole of your boot is as muddy as
mine;’ and one on ’em is, because I always
rests myself on that foot&mdash;the other sole, you
see, is as clean as when it was first made. The
women never seem frightened on me. My trade
is to sell brooms and brushes, and all kinds of
cutlery and tin-ware. I learnt it myself. I
never was brought up to nothing, because I
couldn’t use my hands. Mother was a cook
in a nobleman’s family when I were born. They
say as I was a love-child. I was not brought
up by mother, but by one of her fellow-servants.
Mother’s intellects was so weak,
that she couldn’t have me with her. She used
to fret a great deal about me, so her fellow-servant
took me when she got married. After
I were born, mother married a farmer in
middling circumstances. They tell me as my
mother was frightened afore I was born. I
never knew my father. He went over to Buonos
Ayres, and kept an hotel there&mdash;I’ve heard
mother say as much. No mother couldn’t love
a child more than mine did me, but her feelings
was such she couldn’t bear to see me. I never
went to mother’s to live, but was brought up by
the fellow-servant as I’ve told you of. Mother
allowed her 30<i>l.</i> a-year. I was with her till two
years back. She was always very kind to me&mdash;treated
me like one of her own. Mother used to
come and see me about once a-year&mdash;sometimes
not so often: she was very kind to me then.
Oh, yes; I used to like to see her very much.
Whatever I wished for she’d let me have; if I
wrote to her, she always sent me what I wanted.
I was very comfortably then. Mother died four
years ago; and when I lost her I fell into a fit&mdash;I
was told of it all of a sudden. She and the
party as I was brought up with was the only
friends as I had in the world&mdash;the only persons
as cared anything about a creature like me.
I was in a fit for hours, and when I came to,
I thought what would become of me: I knew
I could do nothing for myself, and the only
friend as I had as could keep me was gone.
The person as brought me up was very good,
and said, while she’d got a home I should
never want; but, two years after mother’s
death, she was seized with the cholera, and
then I hadn’t a friend left in the world.
When she died I felt ready to kill myself;
I was all alone then, and what could I do&mdash;cripple
as I was? She thought her
sons and daughters as I’d been brought up
with&mdash;like brothers and sisters&mdash;would look
after me; but it was not in their power&mdash;they
was only hard-working people. My
mother used to allow so much a year for my
schooling, and I can read and write pretty well.”
(He wrote his name in my presence kneeling
at the table; holding the pen almost as one
might fancy a bird would, and placing the
paper sideways instead of straight before him.)
“While mother was alive, I was always foraging
about to learn something unbeknown to her.
I wanted to do so, in case mother should leave
me without the means of getting a living. I
used to buy old bedsteads, and take them to
a man, and get him to repair them, and then
I’d put the sacking on myself; I can hold a
hammer somehow in my right hand. I used to
polish them on my knees. I made a bench
to my height out of two old chairs. I used to
know what I should get for the bedsteads, and
so could tell what I could afford to give the
man to do up the parts as I couldn’t manage.
It was so I got to learn something like a business
for myself. When the person died as had
brought me up, I <i>could</i> do a little; I had then
got the means. Before her death I had opened
a kind of shop for things in the general line; I
sold tin-ware, and brass-work, and candlesticks,
and fire-irons, and all old furniture, and gown-prints
as well. I went into the tally business,
and that ruined me altogether. I couldn’t get
my money in; there’s a good deal owing to me
now. Me and a boy used to manage the whole.
I used to make all my account-books and
everything. My lodgers didn’t pay me my
rent, so I had to move from the house, and
live on what stock I had. In my new lodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
I went on as well as I could for a little while;
but about eighteen months ago I could hold on
no longer. Then I borrowed a little, and went
hawking tin-ware and brushes in the country.
I sold baking-dishes, Dutch ovens, roasting-jacks,
skewers and gridirons, teapots and saucepans,
and combs. I used to exchange sometimes
for old clothes. I had a barrow and a
boy with me; I used to keep him, and give him
1<i>s.</i> a week. I managed to get just a living
that way. When the winter came on I gave it
up; it was too cold. After that I was took bad
with a fever; my stock had been all gone a
little while before, and the boy had left because
I couldn’t keep him, and I had to do all for
myself. All my friends was dead, and I had no
one to help me, so I was obligated to lay about
all night in my things, for I couldn’t get them
off alone; and that and want of food brought on
a fever. Then I was took into the workhouse,
and there I stopped all the summer, as I told
you. I can’t say they treated me bad, but
they certainly didn’t use me well. If I could
have worked after I got better, I could have
had tea; but ’cause I couldn’t do nothing, they
gave me that beastly gruel morning and night.
I had meat three times a week. They would
have kept me there till now, but I would die in
the streets rather than be a pauper. So I told
them, if they would give me the means of
getting a stock, I would try and get a living
for myself. After refusing many times to let me
have 10<i>s.</i>, they agreed to give me 5<i>s.</i> Then I
came out, but I had no home, and so I crawled
about till I met with the people where I am now,
and they let me sit up there till I got a room of
my own. Then some of my friends collected for
me about 15<i>s.</i> altogether, and I did pretty well
for a little while. I went to live close by the
Blackfriars-road, but the people where I lodged
treated me very bad. There was a number of girls
of the town in the same street, but they was too
fond of their selves and their drink to give nothing.
They used to buy things of me and never pay
me. They never made game of me, nor played
me any tricks, and if they saw the boys doing it
they would protect me. They never offered to
give me no victuals; indeed, I shouldn’t have
liked to have eaten the food they got. After
that I couldn’t pay my lodgings, and the parties
where I lodged turned me out, and I had to crawl
about the streets for four days and nights. This
was only a month back. I was fit to die with
pain all that time. If I could get a penny I
used to go into a coffee-shop for half-a-pint of
coffee, and sit there till they drove me out,
and then I’d crawl about till it was time for me
to go out selling. Oh! dreadful, dreadful, it
was to be all them hours&mdash;day and night&mdash;on
my knees. I couldn’t get along at all, I was
forced to sit down every minute, and then I
used to fall asleep with my things in my hand,
and be woke up by the police to be pushed
about and druv on by them. It seemed like
as if I was walking on the bare bones of my
knees. The pain in them was like the cramp,
only much worse. At last I could bear it no
longer, so I went afore Mr. Secker, the magistrate,
at Union Hall, and told him I was destitute,
and that the parties where I had been living
kept my bed and the few things I had, for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
rent, that I owed them. He said he couldn’t
believe that anybody would force me to crawl
about the streets, for four days and nights,
cripple as I was, for such a sum. One of the
officers told him I was a honest and striving
man, and the magistrate sent the officer, with
the money, to get my things, but the landlady
wouldn’t give them till the officer compelled
her, and then she chucked my bed out into
the middle of the street. A neighbour took
it in for me and took care of it till I found
out the tinman who had before let me sit
up in his house. I should have gone to him
at first, but he lived farther than I could
walk. I am stopping with him now, and he
is very kind to me. I have still some relations
living, and they are well to do, but, being
a cripple, they despise me. My aunt, my
mother’s sister, is married to a builder, in
Petersham, near Richmond, and they are rich
people&mdash;having some houses of their own besides
a good business. I have got a boy to wheel me
down on a barrow to them, and asked assistance
of them, but they will have nothing to do with
me. They won’t look at me for my affliction.
Six months ago they gave me half-a-crown. I
had no lodgings nor victuals then; and <i>that</i> I
shouldn’t have had from them had I not said
I was starving and must go to the parish. This
winter I went to them, and they shut the door
in my face. After leaving my aunt’s, I went
down to Ham Common, where my father-in-law
lives, and there his daughter’s husband sent for
a policeman to drive me away from the place.
I told the husband I had no money nor food;
but he advised me to go begging, and said I
shouldn’t have a penny of them. My father-in-law
was ill up-stairs at the time, but I don’t
think he would have treated me a bit better&mdash;and
all this they do because the Almighty has
made me a cripple. I can, indeed, solemnly
say, that there is nothing else against me, and
that I strive hard and crawl about till my limbs
ache enough to drive me mad, to get an honest
livelihood. With a couple of pounds I could, I
think, manage to shift very well for myself.
I’d get a stock, and go into the country with a
barrow, and buy old metal, and exchange tin
ware for old clothes, and, with that, I’m almost
sure I could get a decent living. I’m accounted
a very good dealer.”</p>

<p>In answer to my inquiries concerning the
character of this man, I received the following
written communication:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have known C&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash; twelve years; the last
six years he has dealt with me for tinware. I have
found him honest in all his dealings with me, sober
and industrious.</p>

<p class="sig">
“C&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;, Tinman.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>From the writer of the above testimonial I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
received the following account of the poor
<span class="lock">cripple:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“He is a man of generous a disposition, and
very sensitive for the afflictions of others. One
day while passing down the Borough he saw
a man afflicted with St. Vitus’s dance shaking
from head to foot, and leaning on the arm of a
woman who appeared to be his wife.” The
cripple told my informant that he should never
forget what he felt when he beheld that poor
man. “I thought,” he said, “what a blessing
it is I am not like him.” Nor is the cripple, I
am told, less independent than he is generous.
In all his sufferings and privations he never
pleads poverty to others; but bears up under
the trials of life with the greatest patience and
fortitude. When in better circumstances he
was more independent than at present, having
since, through illness and poverty, been much
humbled.</p>

<p>“His privations have been great,” adds my
informant. “Only two months back, being in a
state of utter destitution and quite worn out
with fatigue, he called at the house of a person
(where my informant occupied a room) about
ten o’clock at night, and begged them to let him
rest himself for a short while, but the inhuman
landlady and her son laid hold of the wretched
man, the one taking him by the arms and the
other by the legs, and literally hurled him into
the street. The next morning,” my informant
continued, “I saw the poor creature leaning
against a lamp-post, shivering with the cold,
and my heart bled for him; and since that he
has been living with me.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Swag-shops of the Metropolis.</span></h3>

<p>By those who are not connected with the street
trade, the proprietors of the swag-shops are often
called “warehousemen” or “general dealers,”
and even “slaughterers.” These descriptions
apply but partially. “Warehousemen” or
“general dealers” are vague terms, which I
need not further notice. The wretchedly under-paid
and over-worked shoe-makers, cabinet-makers
and others call these places “slaughter-houses,”
when the establishment is in the hands
of tradesmen who buy their goods of poor workmen
without having given orders for them. On
Saturday afternoons pale-looking men may be
seen carrying a few chairs, or bending under
the weight of a cheffonier or a chest of drawers,
in Tottenham-court Road, and thoroughfares of
a similar character in all parts. These are
“small masters,” who make or (as one man said
to me, “No, sir, I don’t make these drawers, I
put them together, it can’t be called making;
it’s not workmanship”) who “put together” in
the hastiest manner, and in any way not positively
offensive to the eye, articles of household
furniture. The “slaughterers” who supply
all the goods required for the furniture of a
house, buy at “starvation prices” (the common
term), the artificer being often kept waiting for
hours, and treated with every indignity. One
East-end “slaughterer” (as I ascertained in a
former inquiry) used habitually to tell that he
prayed for wet Saturday afternoons, because it
put 20<i>l.</i> extra into his pocket! This was owing
to the damage sustained in the appearance of
any painted, varnished, or polished article, by
exposure to the weather; or if it had been protected
from the weather, by the unwillingness
of the small master to carry it to another
slaughter-house in the rain. Under such circumstances&mdash;and
under most of the circumstances
of this unhappy trade&mdash;the poor workman
is at the mercy of the slaughterer.</p>

<p>I describe this matter more fully than I might
have deemed necessary, had I not found that
both the “small masters” spoken of&mdash;for I
called upon some of them again&mdash;and the
street-sellers, very frequently confounded the
“swag-shop” and the “slaughter-house.” The
distinction I hold to be this:&mdash;The slaughterer
buys as a rule, with hardly an exception, the
furniture, or whatever it may be, made for the
express purpose of being offered to him on
speculation of sale. The swag shop-keeper
<i>orders</i> his goods as a rule, and buys, as an
exception, in the manner in which the slaughterer
buys ordinarily. The slaughterer sells by
retail; the swag-shop keeper only by wholesale.</p>

<p>Most of the articles, of the class of which I
now treat, are “Brummagem made.” An
experienced tradesman said to me: “All these
low-priced metal things, fancy goods and all,
which you see about, are made in Birmingham;
in nineteen cases out of twenty at the
least. They may be marked London, or
Sheffield, or Paris, or any place&mdash;you can
have them marked North Pole if you will&mdash;but
they’re genuine Birmingham. The carriage
is lower from Birmingham than from
Sheffield&mdash;that’s one thing.”</p>

<p>The majority of the swag-shop proprietors
are Jews. The wares which they supply to the
cheap shops, the cheap John’s, and the street-sellers,
in town and country, consist of every
variety of article, apart from what is eatable,
drinkable, or wearable, in which the trade class
I have specified can deal. As regards what is
wearable, indeed, such things as braces, garters,
&amp;c., form a portion of the stock of the swag-shop.</p>

<p>In one street (a thoroughfare at the east-end
of London) are twenty-three of these establishments.
In the windows there is little attempt
at display; the design aimed at seems to be
rather to <i>crowd</i> the window&mdash;as if to show the
amplitude of the stores within, “the wonderful
resources of this most extensive and universal
establishment”&mdash;than to tempt purchasers by
exhibiting tastefully what may have been tastefully
executed by the artificer, or what it is
desired should be held to be so executed.</p>

<p>In one of these windows the daylight is
almost precluded from the interior by what may
be called a perfect wall of “pots.” A street-seller
who accompanied me called them merely
“pots” (the trade term), but they were all pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
ornaments. Among them were great store of
shepherdesses, of greyhounds of a gamboge
colour, of what I heard called “figures”
(allegorical nymphs with and without birds or
wreaths in their hands), very tall-looking
Shaksperes (I did not see one of these windows
without its Shakspere, a sitting figure),
and some “pots” which seem to be either
shepherds or musicians; from what I could
learn, at the pleasure of the seller, the buyer,
or the inquirer. The shepherd, or musician is
usually seated under a tree; he wears a light
blue coat, and yellow breeches, and his limbs,
more than his body, are remarkable for their
bulk; to call them merely fat does not sufficiently
express their character, and in some
“pots,” they are as short and stumpy as they
are bulky. On my asking if the dogs were
intended for Italian greyhounds, I was told,
“No, they are German.” I alluded however
to the species of the animal represented; my
informant to the place of manufacture, for the
pots were chiefly German. A number of mugs
however, with the Crystal Palace very well
depicted upon them, were unmistakably English.
In another window of the same establishment
was a conglomeration of pincushions,
shaving-brushes, letter-stamps (all in bone),
cribbage-boards and boxes (including a pack of
cards), necklaces, and strings of beads.</p>

<p>The window of a neighbouring swag-shop
presented, in the like crowding, and in greater
confusion, an array of brooches (some in coloured
glass to imitate rubies, topazes, &amp;c.,
some containing portraits, deeply coloured, in
purple attire, and red cheeks, and some being
very large cameos), time-pieces (with and without
glasses), French toys with moveable figures,
telescopes, American clocks, musical boxes,
shirt-studs, backgammon-boards, tea-trays (one
with a nondescript bird of most gorgeous green
plumage forming a sort of centrepiece), razor-strops
writing-desks, sailors’ knives, hair-brushes,
and tobacco-boxes.</p>

<p>Another window presented even a more
“miscellaneous assortment;” dirks (apparently
not very formidable weapons), a mess of steel
pens, in brown-paper packages and cases, and
of black-lead pencils, pipe-heads, cigar-cases,
snuff-boxes, razors, shaving-brushes, letter-stamps,
metal tea-pots, metal tea-spoons, glass
globes with artificial flowers and leaves within
the glass (an improvement one man thought on
the old ornament of a reel in a bottle), Peel
medals, Exhibition medals, roulette-boxes,
scent bottles, quill pens with artificial flowers in
the feathery part, fans, side-combs, glass pen-holders,
and pot figures (caricatures) of Louis
Philippe, carrying a very red umbrella, Marshal
Haynau, with some instrument of torture
in his hand, while over all boomed a huge
English seaman, in yellow waistcoat and with a
brick-coloured face.</p>

<p>Sometimes the furniture of a swag-shop
window is less plentiful, but quite as heterogenous.
In one were only American clocks,
French toys (large), opera-glasses, knives and
forks, and powder-flasks.</p>

<p>In some windows the predominant character
is jewellery. Ear-drops (generally gilt), rings
of all kinds, brooches of every size and shade
of coloured glass, shawl-pins, shirt-studs, necklaces,
bead purses, small paintings of the
Crystal-palace, in “burnished ‘gold’ frames,”
watch-guards, watch-seals (each with three impressions
or mottoes), watch-chains and keys,
“silver” tooth-picks, medals, and snuff-boxes.
It might be expected that the jewellery shops
would present the most imposing display of any;
they are, on the contrary, among the dingiest,
as if it were not worth the trouble to put clean
things in the window, but merely what sufficed
to characterise the nature of the trade carried
on.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-three swag-shops in question,
five were confined to the trade in all the branches
of stationery. Of these I saw one, the large
window of which was perfectly packed from
bottom to top with note-paper, account and
copy-books, steel-pens, pencils, sealing-wax,
enamelled wafers (in boxes), ink-stands, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the other shops, two had cases of watches,
with no attempt at display, or even arrangement.
“Poor things,” I was told by a person
familiar with the trade in them, “fit only to
offer to countrymen when they’ve been drinking
at a fair, and think themselves clever.”</p>

<p>I have so far described the exterior of these
street-dealers’ bazaars, the swag-shops, in what
may be called their head-quarters. Upon entering
some of these places of business, spacious
rooms are seen to extend behind the shop or
warehouse which opens to the street. Some are
almost blocked up with what appears a litter of
packing-cases, packages, and bales&mdash;but which
are no doubt ordered systematically enough&mdash;while
the shelves are crammed with goods in
brown paper, or in cases or boxes. This uniformity
of package, so to speak, has the effect of
destroying the true character of these swag
store-rooms; for they present the appearance of
only three or four different kinds of merchandise
being deposited on a range of shelves, when,
perhaps, there are a hundred. In some of these
swag-shops it appears certain, both from what
fell under my own observation, and from what I
learned through my inquiries of persons long
familiar with such places, that the “litter” I
have spoken of is disposed so as to present the
appearance of an affluence of goods without the
reality of possession.</p>

<p>In no warehouses (properly “swag,” or
wholesale traders) is there any arranged display
of the wares vended. “Ve don’t vant people
here,” one street-seller had often heard a swag-shopkeeper
say, “as looks about them, and
says, ‘’Ow purty!&mdash;Vot nice things!’ Ve
vants to sell, and not to show. Ve is all for
bisness, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d.” All of these places
which I saw were dark, more or less so, in the
interior, as if a customer’s inspection were uncared
for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the swag-shop people present cards, or
“circulars with prices,” to their street and other
customers, calling attention to the variety of their
wares. These circulars are not given without
inquiry, as if it were felt that one must not be
wasted. On one I find the following <span class="lock">enumeration:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It must not be thought that swag-shops are
mainly repositories of “fancy” articles, for such is
not the case. I have described only the “windows”
and outward appearances of these places&mdash;the
interior being little demonstrative of the business;
but the bulkier and more useful articles of
swag traffic cannot be exposed in a window. In
the miscellaneous (or Birmingham and Sheffield)
shops, however, the useful and the “fancy” are
mixed together; as is shown by the following
extracts from the Circular of one of the principal
swag-houses. I give each head, with an occasional
statement of prices. The firm describe
themselves as “Wholesale, Retail, and Export
Furnishing Ironmongers, General Hardwaremen,
Manufacturers of Clocks, Watches, and Steel Pens,
and Importers of Toys, Beads, and other Foreign
Manufactures.”</p>

to mention.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the specific character and
arrangement of the “Circulars with prices,” it is
common enough for the swag-shop proprietors to
intimate to any one likely to purchase that those
prices are not altogether to be a guidance, as
thirty-five per cent. discount is allowed on the
amount of a ready-money purchase. One of the
largest “swags” made such an allowance to a
street-seller last week.</p>

<p>The swag-shops (of which I state the numbers
in a parenthesis) are in Houndsditch (their principal
locality) (23), Minories (4), Whitechapel
(2), Ratcliffe-highway (20), Shoreditch (1), Long-lane,
Smithfield (4), Fleet-lane (2), Holywell-street,
Strand (1), Tothill-street (4), Compton-street,
Soho (1), Hatton-garden (2), Clerkenwell
(10), Kent-street, Borough (8), New-cut (6),
Blackman-street (2), Tooley-street (3), London-road
(3), Borough-road (1), Waterloo-road (4)&mdash;in
all 101; but a person who had been upwards
of twenty years a frequenter of these places
counted up fifty others, many of them in obscure
courts and alleys near Houndsditch, Ratcliffe
Highway, &amp;c., &amp;c. These “outsiders” are generally
of a smaller class than those I have described;
“and I can tell you, sir,” the same man said,
“some of them&mdash;ay, and some of the big ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
too&mdash;are real <i>swag</i>-shops still,&mdash;partly so, that is;
you understand me, sir.” The word “swag,” I
should inform my polite readers, means in slang
language, “plunder.”</p>

<p>It may be safely calculated, then, that there
are 150 swag-shops to which the different classes
of street-sellers resort for the purchase of stock.
Among these establishments are pot swag, stationery
swag, haberdashery swag, jewellery swag,
and miscellaneous swag&mdash;the latter comprise far
more than half of the entire number, and constitute
the warehouses which are described by their
owners as “Birmingham and Sheffield,” or “English
and Foreign,” or “English and German.” It
is in these last-mentioned “swags” that the class
I now treat of&mdash;the street-sellers of metal manufactures&mdash;find
the commodities of their trade. To
this, however, there is one exception. Tins for
household use are not sold at the general swag-shops;
but “fancy tins,” such as japanned and
embellished trays, are vended there extensively.
The street-sellers of this order are supplied at the
“tin-shops,”&mdash;the number of the wholesale tin-men
supplying the street-sellers is about fifty.
The principle on which the business is conducted
is precisely that of the more general swag-shop;
but I shall speak of them when I treat of the
street-sellers of tins.</p>

<p>An intelligent man, who had been employed in
different capacities in some of the principal swag-shops,
told me of one which had been carried on
by the same family, from father to son, for more
than seventy years. In the largest of the “swags”
about 200 “hands” are employed, in the various
capacities of salesmen, buyers, clerks, travellers,
unpackers, packers, porters, &amp;c., &amp;c. On some
mornings twenty-five large packages&mdash;some of
small articles entirely&mdash;are received from the
carriers. In one week, when my informant
assisted in “making up the books,” the receipts
were upwards of 3000<i>l.</i> “In my opinion, sir,”
he said, “and it’s from an insight into the business,
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;’s profit on that 3000<i>l.</i> was not
less than thirty-five per cent.; for he’s a great
capitalist, and pays for everything down upon the
nail; that’s more than 1000<i>l.</i> profit in a week.
Certainly it was an extra week, and there’s the
200 hands to pay,&mdash;but that wouldn’t range
higher than 300<i>l.</i>, indeed, not so high; and
there’s heavy rent and taxes, and rates, no doubt,
and he (the proprietor is a Jew) is a fair man to
the trade, and not an uncharitable man&mdash;but he
will drive a good bargain where it’s possible; so
considering everything, sir, the profits must be
very great, and they are mostly made out of poor
buyers, who sell it to poor people in the streets,
or in small shops. It’s a wonderful trade.”</p>

<p>From the best information I could obtain I
come to the conclusion that, including small and
large shops, 3000<i>l.</i> yearly is the average receipt
of each&mdash;or, as it is most frequently expressed,
that sum is “turned over” by the swag-shop
keepers yearly. There is great competition in the
trade, and much of what is called “cutting,” or
one tradesman underselling another. The profit
consequently varies from twenty to thirty-five and
(rarely) fifty per cent. Sometimes a swag-shop
proprietor is “hung-up” with a stock the demand
for which has ceased, and he must dispose of it as
“a job lot,” to make room for other goods, and
thus is necessarily “out of pocket.” The smaller
swag-shops do not “turn over” 500<i>l.</i> a year. The
calculation I have given shows an outlay, yearly,
of 450,000<i>l.</i> at the swag-shops of London; “but,”
said a partner in one of these establishments,
“what proportion of the goods find their way into
the streets, what to the shops, what to the country,
and what for shipping, I cannot form even a
guess, for we never ask a customer for what purpose
he wants the goods, though sometimes he
will say, ‘I must have what is best for such or
such a trade.’ Say half a million turned over in
a year, sir, by the warehousemen who sell to the
street-people, among others, and you’re within the
mark.”</p>

<p>I found the street-sellers characterize the
“swags” as hard and grinding men, taking every
advantage “in the way of trade.” There is, too,
I was told by a man lately employed in a swag-shop
a constant collision of clamour and bargaining,
not to say of wits, between the smarter street-sellers&mdash;the
pattering class especially&mdash;and the
swag-men with whom they are familiar.</p>

<p>The points in which the “swag-shops” resemble
the “slaughter-houses,” are in the traffic in
work-boxes, desks, and dressing-cases.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of a Cheap-John.</span></h3>

<p>The following narrative, relative to this curious
class, who, in many respects, partake of the characteristics
which I have pointed out as proper to
the mountebank of old, was taken from one of
the fraternity. It may be cited as an example
of those who are bred to the streets:&mdash;“My
father and mother,” said he, “both followed a
travelling occupation, and were engaged in vending
different things, from the old brimstone
matches up to clothes lines, clothes props, and
clothes pegs. They never got beyond these,&mdash;the
other articles were thread, tapes, nutmeg graters,
shoe-ties, stay-laces, and needles. My father, my
mother used to tell me, was a great scholard, and
had not always been a travelling vagrant. My
mother had never known any other life. I, however,
did not reap any benefit from my father’s
scholarship. At a very early age, five or six perhaps,
I recollect myself a poor little neglected
wretch, sent out each day with a roll of matches,
with strict injunctions not to come home without
selling them, and to bring home a certain sum of
money, upon pain of receiving a sound thrashing,
which threat was mostly put into execution whenever
I failed to perform the task imposed upon
me. My father seldom worked, that is, seldom
hawked, but my mother, poor thing, had to travel
and work very hard to support four of us&mdash;my
father, myself, and a sister, who is since dead. I
was but little assistance, and sometimes when I
did not bring home the sum required, she would
make it up, and tell my father I had been a good
boy. My father was an inveterate drinker, and a
very violent temper. My mother, I am sorry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
say, used to drink too, but I believe that ill-usage
drove her to it. They led a dreadful life; I
scarcely felt any attachment for them; home we
had none, one place was as good another to us. I
left my parents when scarcely eight years old. I
had received a thrashing the day before for being
a defaulter in my sale, and I determined the following
morning to decamp; and accordingly, with
my nine-pennyworth of matches (the quantity
generally allotted me), I set out to begin the
world upon my own account. Although this occurred
25 years ago, I have never met my parents
since. My father, I heard, died a few years after
my leaving, but my mother I know not whether
she be living or dead. I left my parents at Dover,
and journeyed on to London. I knew there were
lodging-houses for travellers in every town, some
of them I had stopped at with my father and
mother. I told the people of these houses that
my parents would arrive the following day,
and paid my 2<i>d.</i> for the share of a third, fourth,
fifth, or even sixth part of a bed, according to the
number of children who inhabited the lodging-house
upon that particular night. My matches I
could always sell if I tried, but I used to play my
time away, and many times night has arrived before
I thought of effecting sales sufficient to pay
my expenses at the beggar’s hotel. Broken
victuals I got in abundance, indeed more than
sufficient for my own consumption. The money I
received for the matches, after paying my lodging,
and purchasing a pennyworth of brimstone to
make more (the wood I begged at the carpenters),
I gambled away at cards. Yes, young as I was,
I understood Blind Hookey. I invariably lost;
of course I was cheated.</p>

<p>“I remained in a lodging house in Mill-lane,
Deptford, for two years, discontinued the match-selling,
and, having a tidy voice, took to hawking
songs through the public-houses. The sailors used
to ask me to sing, and there were few days that I
did not accumulate 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and from that to 4<i>s.</i>,
especially when I chose to be industrious; but my
love of pitch and toss and blind hookey always
kept me poor. I often got into debt with my
landlady, and had no difficulty in doing so, for I
always felt a pride in paying. From selling the
printed songs, I imbibed a wish to learn to
read, and, with the assistance of an old soldier,
I soon acquired sufficient knowledge to make
out the names of each song, and shortly afterwards
I could study a song and learn the
words without any one helping me. I stopped
in Deptford until I was something more than
twelve years old. I had then laid the songs
aside, and taken to hawking small wares, tapes,
thread, &amp;c.; and in the winter season I was a
buyer of rabbit and hare skins. I kept at this
for about three years, sometimes entirely without
a stock. I had run it out, perhaps gambled it
away; and at such times I suffered great privations.
I never could beg. I have often tried, but
never could. I have approached a house with a
begging intention, knocked at the door, and when it
has been opened I have requested a drink of water.
When I was about 16 I joined in partnership with
a man who used to make phosphorus boxes. I
sold them for him. A piece of phosphorus was
stuck in a tin tube, the match was dipped into
the phosphorus, and it would ignite by friction.
I was hawking these boxes in Norwich,
when the constable considered they were dreadful
affairs, and calculated to encourage and assist
thieves and burglars. He took me before the
magistrate, at the beak’s own private house,
and he being equally horrified, I was sent to
prison for a month. I have often thought
since that the proceeding was illegal. What
would be said now if a man was to be sent to
jail for selling lucifer matches? In Norwich prison
I associated with the rest, and if I had been inclined
to turn thief I had plenty of opportunities
and offers of gratuitous instruction. The separate
or silent system was not in vogue then. I worked
on the treadmill. Dinner was allowed to be sent
in on the Sunday by the prisoner’s friends. My
dinner was sent in on the first Sunday by the man
I sold the boxes for, as it was on the second, third,
and fourth; but I had lost it before I received
it. I had always gambled it away, for there
were plenty of opportunities of doing so in the
prisons then. On leaving the jail I received
1<i>s.</i>; with this I purchased some songs and
travelled to Yarmouth. I could do best among
sailors. After a few weeks I had accumulated
about 8<i>s.</i>, and with that sum I purchased
some hardware at the swag-shop, commenced
hawking, and cut the vocal department altogether;
still I gambled and kept myself in poverty. In
the course of time, however, I had amassed a
basket of goods, worth, perhaps, 3<i>l.</i> I gambled
and lost them all in one night. I was so downcast
and unhappy from this circumstance, that it
caused me to reflect seriously, and I made an oath
that I never would gamble again. I have kept
it, and have reason to bless the day that I made
so good a resolution. After losing my basket of
goods, the winner gave me articles amounting to a
few shillings, and I began the world once more.
Shortly afterwards I commenced rag gatherer, and
changed my goods for old rags, of course not
refusing cash in payment. My next step was to
have some bills printed, whereon I requested all
thrifty wives to look out their old rags or old
metal, or old bones, &amp;c.; stating at the bottom
that the bill would be called for, and that a
good price in ready money would be given for
all useless lumber, &amp;c. Some months at this
business realized me a pretty sum of money.
I was in possession of nearly 5<i>l.</i> Then I discontinued
the rag-gathering; not that the trade
was declining, but I did not like it&mdash;I was ambitious.
I purchased a neat box, and started to
sell a little Birmingham jewellery. I was now
respectably dressed, was getting a living, and had
entirely left off stopping at common lodging-houses;
but I confined my visits to small villages&mdash;I was
afraid of the law; and as I was pursuing my calling
near Wakefield, a constable inquired for my
hawker’s licence. I had none to produce. He
took me into custody, and introduced me to a
magistrate, who committed me to prison for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
month, and took away my box of goods. I
endured the month’s imprisonment upon the silent
system; they cut my hair short; and at the
expiration of the term I was thrust out upon the
world heart-broken, without a shilling, to beg, to
steal, or to starve.</p>

<p>“I proceeded to Leeds, the fair was on at this
time. I got engaged to assist a person, from whom
I had been accustomed occasionally to purchase
goods. He was a ‘Cheap-John.’ In the course of
the day he suggested that I should have a try at
the hand-selling. I mounted the platform, and
succeeded beyond my own expectations or that of
my master. He offered me a regular engagement,
which I accepted. At times I would help him
sell, and at other times I hawked with his licence.
I had regular wages, besides all I could get above
a certain price that he placed upon each of the
goods. I remained with this person some fifteen
months, at the end of which period I commenced
for myself, having saved nearly 25<i>l.</i> I began at
once the hand-selling, and purchased a hawker’s
licence, which enabled me to sell without danger.
Then I always called at the constable’s house, and
gave a louder knock at his door than any other
person’s, proud of my authority, and assured of
my safety. At first I borrowed an empty cart,
in which I stood and sold my wares. I could
chaff as well as the best, and was as good
a salesman as most of them. After that I purchased
a second-hand cart from a person who had
lately started a waggon. I progressed and improved
in circumstances, and at last bought a very
handsome waggon for myself. I have now a
nice caravan, and good stock of goods, worth at
least 500<i>l.</i> Money I have but little. I always
invest it in goods. I am married, and have got a
family. I always travel in the summer, but remain
at home during the winter. My wife never
travels. She remains behind, and manages a
little swag-shop, which always turns in at least
the family expenses.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Street-Sellers of Cutlery.</span></h3>

<p>The cutlery sold in the streets of London consists
of razors, pen-knives, pocket-knives, table
and carving-knives and forks, scissors, shears,
nail-filers, and occasionally (if ordered) lancets.
The knives are of various kinds&mdash;such as sailors’
knives (with a hole through the handle), butchers’
knives, together with choppers and steels (sold
principally at Newgate and Billinsgate Markets,
and round about the docks), oyster and fish-knives
(sold principally at Billinsgate and Hungerford
Markets), bread-knives (hawked at the
bakers’ shops), ham and beef knives (hawked at
the ham and beef shops), cheese-knives with
tasters, and ham-triers, shoemakers’ knives, and a
variety of others. These articles are usually purchased
at the “swag-shops,” and the prices of
them vary from 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> each. They are
bought either by the dozen, half-dozen, or singly,
according to the extent of the street-seller’s stock-money.
Hence it would appear that the street-seller
of cutlery can begin business with only a few
pence; but it is only when the swag-shop keeper
has known the street-seller that he will consent
to sell one knife alone “to sell again;” to street-sellers
with whom he is unacquainted, he will
not vend less than half-a-dozen. Even where the
street-seller is known, he has, if “cracked-up,” to
beg hard, I am told, before he can induce the warehouseman
to let him have only one article. “The
swag-shops won’t be bothered with it,” say the
men&mdash;“what are our troubles to them? if the
rain starves us out and makes us eat up all our
stock-money, what is it to such folks? they
wouldn’t let us have even a row of pins without
the money for ’em&mdash;no, not if we was to drop
down dead for want of bread in their shops.
They have been deceived by such a many that
now they won’t listen to none.” I subjoin a list
of the prices paid and received by the street-sellers
of cutlery for the principal articles in which
they deal:</p>

<p>Their usual rate of profit is 50 per cent., but
rather than refuse a ready sale the street cutlery-seller
will often take much less. Many of the
sellers only pursue the trade for a few weeks in
the year. A number of the Irish labourers take
to it in the winter-time when they can get no work.
Some few of the sellers are countrymen, but these
mostly follow the business continuously. “I don’t
see as there is hardly one upon the list as has ever
been a cutler by trade,” said one street-seller to me,
“and certainly none of the cutlery-sellers have ever
belonged to Sheffield&mdash;they may say so, but its
only a dodge.” The cutlery street-sellers are not
one-quarter so numerous as they were two
years back. “The reason is,” I am told, “that
things are got so bad a man can’t live by
the trade&mdash;mayhap he has to walk three miles
now before he can sell for 1<i>s.</i> a knife that
has cost him 8&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and then mayhap he is faint,
and what’s 3&frac12;<i>d.</i>, sir, to keep body and soul together,
when a man most likely has had no victuals
all the day before.” If they had a good bit of
stock they might perhaps get a crust, they say.
“Things within the last two or three years,” to
quote the words of one of my informants, “have
been getting much worse in the streets; ’specially
in the cutlery line. I can’t give no account for
it, I’m sure, sir; the sellers have not been half as
many as they were. What’s become of them
that’s gone, I can’t tell; they’re in the workhouse,
I dare say.” But, notwithstanding this
decrease in the number of sellers, there is a greater
difficulty to vend their goods now than formerly.
“It’s all owing to the times, that’s all I can say.
People, shopkeepers, and all says to me, I can’t
tell why things is so bad, and has been so bad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
trade; but so they is. We has to walk farther
to sell our goods, and people beat us down so
terrible hard, that we can’t get a penny out of
them when we do sell. Sometimes they offers
me 9<i>d.</i>, yes, and often 6<i>d.</i> for an 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> knife; and
often enough 4<i>d.</i> for one that stands you in 3&frac34;<i>d.</i>&mdash;a
&frac14;<i>d.</i> profit, think of that, sir. Then they say,
‘Well, my man, will you take my money?’ and so
as to make you do so, they’ll flash it before your
eyes, as if they knew you was a starving, and would
be sure to be took in by the sight of it. Yes,
sir, it is a very hard life, and we has to put up
with a good deal&mdash;a good deal&mdash;starvation and
hard-dealing, and insults and knockings about,
and all. And then you see the swag-shops is
almost as hard on us as the buyers. The swag-men
will say, if you merely makes a remark, that
a knife they’ve sold you is cracked in the handle,
‘Oh, is it; let me see whereabouts;’ and when
you hands it to ’em to show it ’em, they’ll put it
back where they took it from, and tell you, ‘You’re
too particular by half, my man. You’d better
go and get your goods somewhere else; here
take your money, and go on about your business,
for we won’t sarve you at all.’ They’ll do just
the same with the scissors too, if you complains
about their being a bit rusty. ‘Go somewhere
else,’ they’ll say, ‘We won’t sarve you.’ Ah, sir,
that’s what it is to be a poor man; to have your
poverty flung in your teeth every minute. People
says, ‘to be poor and seem poor is the devil;’ but
to be poor, and be treated like a dog merely
because you <i>are</i> poor, surely is ten thousand times
worse. A street-seller now-a-days is looked upon
as a ‘cadger,’ and treated as one. To try to get
a living for one’s self is to do something shameful
in these times.”</p>

<p>The man then gave me the following history
of himself. He was a kindly-looking and hearty
old man. He had on a ragged fustian jacket, over
which he wore a black greasy-looking and tattered
oilskin coat&mdash;the collar of this was torn away, and
the green baize lining alone visible. His waistcoat
was patched in every direction, while his
trousers appeared to be of corduroy; but the
grease and mud was so thick upon them, that it
was difficult to tell of what material they were
made. His shoes&mdash;or rather what remained of
them&mdash;were tied on his feet with pieces of string.
His appearance altogether denoted great poverty.</p>

<p>“My father was a farmer, sir. He had two
farms, about 800 acres in all. I was one of
eleven (ten sons and one daughter). Seven years
before my father’s death he left his farm, and
went to live on his money. He had made a
good bit at farming; but when he died it was all
gone, and we was left to shift as we could. I had
little or no education. My brothers could read
and write, but I didn’t take to it; I went a bird’s-nesting,
boy-like, instead, so that what little I did
larn I have forgot. I am very sorry for that
now. I used to drive the plough, and go a harrowing
for father. I was brought up to nothing
else. When father died, I thought as I should
like to see London. I was a mere lad&mdash;about
20&mdash;and so I strolled up to town. I had 10<i>s.</i>
with me, and that, with a bundle, was all
that I possessed in the world. When I got to
London I went to lodge at a public-house&mdash;the
Red Lion&mdash;in Great Wild-street; and while I
was there I sought about for work, but could not
get any; when all was gone, I was turned out
into the streets, and walked about for two days
and two nights, without a bed, or a bit to eat,
unless what I picked out of the gutter, and eat
like a dog&mdash;orange-peel and old cabbage-stumps,
indeed <i>anything</i> I could find. When I was very
hard put to it, I was coming down Drury-lane,
and I looked in, quite casual like, to ask for a job
of work at the shop of Mr. Bolton, the needle-maker
from Redditch. I told him as how I was
nigh starving, and would do anything to get a
crust; I didn’t mind what I put my hand to. He
said he would try me, and gave me two packets of
needles to sell&mdash;they was the goolden-eyed ones
of that time of day&mdash;and he said when I had got
rid of them I was to come back to him, and I
should have two packets more. He told me the
price to ask&mdash;sixpence a paper&mdash;and away I went
like a sand-boy, and got rid of the two in an hour
and a half. Then I went back, and when I told
him what I’d done, he shook hands with me, and
said, as he burst out laughing, “Now, you see
I’ve made a man of you.” Oh, he was an uncommon
nice gentleman! Then he told me
to keep the shilling I had taken, and said he
would trust me with two more packets. I
sold them, and two others besides, that day.
Then, he says, ‘I shall give you something else,’
and he let me have two packets of tailors’ needles
and half a dozen of tailors’ thimbles. He told me
how to sell them, and where to go, and on them I
did better. I went round to the tailors’ shops
and sold a good lot, but at last they stopped me,
because I was taking the bread out of the mouths
of the poor blind needle-sellers what supplies the
journeymen tailors at the West-end. Then Mr.
Bolton sent me down to one of his relations, a
Mr. Crooks, in Fetter Lane, who was a Sheffield
man, and sold cutlery to the hawkers; and Mr.
Crooks and Mr. Bolton sot me up between them,
and so I’ve followed the line ever since. I dare say
I shall continue in it to my dying day. After I
got fairly set agoing, I used to make&mdash;take good
and bad, wet and dry days together&mdash;18<i>s.</i> a week;
three shillings a day was what I calculated on at
the least, and to do that I was obligated to take
between 2<i>l.</i> and 3<i>l.</i> a week, or about eight or nine
shillings each day. I went on doing this for upwards
of thirty year. I have been nearly forty years,
altogether, in the streets, selling cutlery. I did
very tidy till about 4 years back&mdash;I generally
made from 18<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> a week up to that time.
I used to go round the country&mdash;to Margate,
Brighton, Portsmouth&mdash;I mostly travelled by
the coast, calling at all the sea-port towns,
for I always did best among the sailors. I went
away every Spring time, and came to London
again at the fall of the year. Sixteen year ago,
I married the widow of a printer&mdash;a pressman&mdash;she
had no money, but you see I had no home,
and I thought I should be more comfortable, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
I have been&mdash;a great deal more comfortable&mdash;and
so I should be now, if things hadn’t got so bad.
Four year ago, as I was a telling you, it was just
after the railways had knocked off work, things
began to get uncommon bad&mdash;before then, I had
as good as 30<i>s.</i> or 40<i>s.</i> stock, and when things
got slack, it went away, little by little. I couldn’t
make profit enough to support me and my old
woman&mdash;she has got the rheumatics and can’t
earn me a halfpenny or a farden in the world;
she hasn’t done so for years. When I didn’t
make enough to live upon, of course I was
obligated to break into my stock; so there it kept
going shilling by shilling, and sixpence by sixpence,
until I had got nothing left to work upon&mdash;not
a halfpenny. You see, four or five months
ago, I was took very bad with the rheumatic
fever and gout. I got wet through in the
streets, and my clothes dried on me, and the next
day I was taken bad with pains in my limbs,
and then everything that would fetch me a
penny went to the pawn-shop; all my own
and my old woman’s clothes went to get us
food&mdash;blankets, sheets and all. I never would
go nigh the parish; I couldn’t bring myself
to have the talk about it. When I got well
and out into the streets again, I borrowed 2<i>s.</i>
or 3<i>s.</i> of my landlady&mdash;I have lived with her
these three years&mdash;to get my stock again, but you
see that got me so few things, that I couldn’t
fetch myself up. I lost the greater portion of my
time in going backards and forrards to the shop
to get fresh goods as fast as I sold them, and
so what I took wasn’t enough to earn the commonest
living for me and my missus. Since December
we have been nearly starving, and that’s
as true as you have got the pen in your very
hand. Sunday after Sunday we have been without
a bit of dinner, and I have laid a-bed all day
because we have had no coal, and then been obligated
to go out on Monday morning without a bit
of victuals between my lips. I’ve been so faint I
couldn’t hardly walk. I’ve picked the crusts off
the tables of the tap-rooms where I have been to
hawk my goods, and put them in my pocket to
eat them on the sly. Wet and dry I’m obligated
to be out; let it come down ever so hard I must
be in it, with scarcely a bit of shoe, and turned
60 years old, as I am. Look here, sir,” he
said, holding up his foot; “look at these shoes,
the soles is all loose, you see, and let water. On
wet days I hawk my goods to respectable shops;
tap-rooms is no good, decent people merely get
insulted there. But in most of the shops as I
goes to people tells me, ‘My good man it is as
much as we can do to keep ourselves and our
family in these cutting times.’ Now, just to show
you what I done last week. Sunday, I laid a-bed
all day and had no dinner. Monday, I went out
in the morning without a morsel between my lips,
and with only 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> for stock-money; with that I
bought a knife and sold it for a shilling, and then
I got another and another after that, and that was
my day’s work&mdash;three times 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> in all,
to keep the two of us. Tuesday, I sold a pair of
small scissors and two little pearl-handled knives,
at 6<i>d.</i> each article, and cleared 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> on the
whole, and that is all I did. Wednesday, I sold a
razor-strop for 6<i>d.</i>, a four-bladed knife for a shilling,
and a small hone for 6<i>d.</i>; by these I cleared
10<i>d.</i> altogether. Thursday, I sold a pair of razors
for a shilling, clearing by the whole 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> Friday,
I got rid of a pair of razors for 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, and
got 9<i>d.</i> clear.” I added up the week’s profits and
found they amounted to 4<i>s.</i> 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> “That’s about
right,” said the man, “out of that I shall have to
pay 1<i>s.</i> for my week’s rent; we’ve got a kitchen,
so that I leave you to judge how we two can live
out of what’s remaining.” I told him it would’nt
average quite 6<i>d.</i> a day. “That’s about it,” he
replied, “we have half a loaf of bread a day, and
that thank God is only five farthings now. This
lasts us the day, with two-penny-worth of bits of
meat that my old woman buys at a ham-shop,
where they pare the hams and puts the parings by
on plates to sell to poor people; and when she can’t
get that, she buys half a sheep’s head, one that’s
three or four days old, for then they sells ’em to
the poor for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> the half; and these with &frac34;<i>d.</i>
worth of tea, and &frac12;<i>d.</i> worth of sugar, &frac14;<i>d.</i> for a
candle, 1<i>d.</i> of coal&mdash;that’s seven pounds&mdash;and &frac34;<i>d.</i>
worth of coke&mdash;that’s half a peck&mdash;makes up all
we gets.” These items amount to 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> in all.
“That’s how we do when we can get it, and
when we can’t, why we lays in bed and goes
without altogether.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Blind Street-sellers of Tailors’
Needles, etc.</span></h3>

<p>It is customary with many trades, for the journeymen
to buy such articles as they require in their
business of those members of their craft who have
become incapacitated for work, either by old age,
or by some affliction. The tailors&mdash;the shoe-makers&mdash;the
carpenters&mdash;and many others do
this. These sellers are, perhaps, the most exemplary
instances of men <i>driven</i> to the streets, or to
hawking for a means of living; and they, one and
all, are distinguished by that horror of the workhouse
which I have before spoken of as constituting
a peculiar feature in the operative’s character.
At present I purpose treating of the
street-sellers of needles and “trimmings” to the
tailors.</p>

<p>There are, I am informed, two dozen “broken-down”
journeymen tailors pursuing this avocation
in and around London. “There may be more,”
said one who had lost his sight stitching, “but I
get my information from the needle warehouse,
where we all buy our goods; and the lady there
told me she knew as many as twenty-four hawkers
who were once tailors. These are all either decayed
journeymen, or their widows. Some are
incapacitated by age, being between sixty and
seventy years old; the greater part of the aged
journeymen, however, are inmates of the tailors’
almshouses. I am not aware,” said my informant,
“of there being more than one very old man
hawking needles to the tailors, though there may
be many that I know nothing about. The one I
am acquainted with is close upon eighty, and he
is a very respectable man, much esteemed in St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
James’s and St. George’s; he sells needles, and
‘London Labour and the London Poor’ to the journeymen:
he is very feeble indeed, and can scarcely
get along.” Of the two dozen needle-sellers above
mentioned, there are only six who confine their
“rounds” solely to the metropolis. Out of these
six my informant knew two who were blind
beside himself (one of these sells to the journeymen
in the city). There are other blind tailors
who were formerly hawkers of needles, but being
unable to realize a subsistence thereby, have been
obliged to become inmates of the workhouses; others
have recently gained admission into the almshouses.
Last February, I am assured, there were two blind
needle-sellers, and two decrepit, in St. James’s
workhouse. There are, moreover, two widows selling
tailors’ needles in London. One of these, I am
told, is wretchedly poor, being “eat up with the
rheumatics, and scarcely able to move”&mdash;she is
the relict of a blind journeyman, and well known
in St. James’s. The other widow is now in St.
Pancras Workhouse, having been unable, to use
the words of my informant, “to get anything to
keep life and soul together at the needle trade;”
she, too, I am told, is well known to the journeymen.
The tailors’ needle-sellers confining themselves
more particularly to London consist of, at
present, one old man, three blind, one paralyzed,
and one widow; besides these, there are now in
the alms-houses, two decrepit and one paralyzed;
and one widow in the workhouse, all of whom,
till recently, were needle-sellers, and originally
connected with the trade.</p>

<p>“That is all that I believe are now in London,”
said one to me, “I should, I think, know
if there were more; for it is not from one place
we get our articles, but many; and there I hear
that six is about the number of tailors’ hawkers in
town; the rest of the two dozen hawkers that I
spoke of go a little way out into the suburbs.
The six, however, stick to London altogether.”
The needle-sellers who go into the country, I am
told, travel as far as Reading, westward, and to
Gravesend, in the opposite direction, or Brentwood,
in Essex, and they will keep going
back’ards and for’ards to the metropolis immediately
their stock is exhausted. These persons
sell not only tailors’ needles, but women’s needles
as well, and staylaces and cottons, and small ware
in general, which they get from Shepherd’s, in
Compton Street; they have all been tailors, and
are incapacitated from labour, either by old age or
some affliction. There was one widow of a tailor
among the number, but it is believed she is now
either too old to continue her journeys, or else
that she is deceased. The town-sellers confine
their peregrinations mostly to the parishes
of St. James’s and St. George’s (my informant
was not aware that any went even into Marylebone).
One travels the City, while the other
five keep to the West End; they all sell
thimbles, needles, inch-measures, bodkins, inch
sticks, scissars (“when they can get them,” I was
told, “and that’s very seldom”), and bees’-wax,
basting cotton, and, many of them, publications.
The publications vended by these men are principally
the cheap periodicals of the day, and two of
these street-sellers, I am informed, do much better
with the sale of publications than by the “trimmings.”
“<i>They</i> get money, sir,” said one man to
me, “while <i>we</i> are starving. They have their set
customers and have only to go round and leave
the paper, and then to get their money on the
Monday morning.”</p>

<p>The tailors’ hawkers buy their trimmings mostly
at the retail shops. They have not stock-money
sufficient, I am assured, to purchase at the wholesale
houses, for “such a thing as a paper of
needles large tradesmen don’t care about of
selling us poor men.” They tell me that if they
could buy wholesale they could get their goods one-fourth
cheaper, and to be “obligated” to purchase
retail is a great drawback on their profits. They
call at the principal tailors’ workshops, and solicit
custom of the journeymen; they are almost all
known to the trade, both masters and men, and,
having no other means of living, they are allowed
to enter the masters’ shops, though some of the
masters, such as Allen, in Bond-street; Curlewis,
Jarvis, and Jones, in Conduit-street, and others,
refuse the poor fellows even this small privilege.
The journeymen treat them very kindly, the
needle-sellers tell me, and generally give them
part of the provisions they have brought with
them to the shop. If it was not for this the
needle-sellers, I am assured, could hardly live at
all. “There’s that boy there,” said a blind
tailor, speaking of the youth who had led him
to my house, and who sat on the stool fast asleep
by the fire,&mdash;“I’m sure he must have starved
this winter if it hadn’t been for the goodness of
the men to us, for it’s little that me and his
mother has to give him; she’s gone almost as
blind as myself working at the ‘sank work’
(making up soldiers’ clothing). Oh, ours is a
miserable life, sir!&mdash;worn out&mdash;blind with over
work, and scarcely a hole to put one’s head in, or a
bit to put in one’s mouth. God Almighty knows
that’s the bare truth, sir.” Sometimes the hawkers
go on their rounds and take only 2<i>d.</i>, but that is
not often; sometimes they take 5<i>s.</i> in a day, and
“that is the greatest sum,” said my informant,
“I ever took; what others might do I can’t say,
but that I’m confident is about the highest
takings.” In the summer three months the average
takings rise to 4<i>s.</i> per day; but in the winter
they fall to 1<i>s.</i>, or at the outside 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The
business lasts only for three hours and a half each
day, that is from eight till half-past eleven in
the morning; after that no good is to be
done. Then the needle-sellers, I am told, go
home, and the reason of this is, I am told, if
they appear in the public streets selling or soliciting
alms, the blind are exempted from becoming
recipients of the benefits of many of the
charitable institutions. The blind man whom I saw,
told me that after he had done work and returned
home, he occupied himself with pressing the
seams of the soldiers’ clothes when his “missus”
had sewed them. The tailors’ needle-sellers are
all married, and one of the wives has a mangle;
and “perhaps,” said my informant, “the blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
husband turns the mangle when he goes home,
but I can’t say.” Another wife is a bookfolder,
but she has no work. The needles they usually
sell five a penny to the journeymen, but the most
of the journeymen will take but four; they say
“we can’t get a living at all if we sell the needles
cheaper. The journeymen are mostly very considerate&mdash;very
indeed; much more than the
masters; for the masters won’t hardly look at
us. I don’t know that a master ever gave me a
farden&mdash;and yet there’s some of them very soothing
and kind in speaking.” The profit in the
needles, I am told, is rather more than 100 per
cent.; “but,” say the sellers, “only think, sir, we
must get rid of 150 needles even to take 3<i>s.</i>
The most we ever sell in one shop is 6<i>d.</i> worth&mdash;and
the usual amount is 2<i>d.</i> worth. You can
easy tell how many shops we must travel round
to, in order to get rid of 3<i>s.</i> worth.” Take one shop
with another, the good with the bad, they tell
me they make about 1<i>d.</i> profit from each they
visit. The profit on the rest of the articles they
vend is about 20 per cent., and they calculate
that all the year round, summer and winter, they
may be said to take 2<i>s.</i> a day, or 12<i>s.</i> a week;
out of which they clear from 5<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> They
sell far more needles than anything else. Some of
the blind needle-sellers make their own bees’-wax
into “shapes,” (pennyworths) themselves, melting
into and pouring into small moulds.</p>

<p>The blind needle-seller whom I saw was a
respectable-looking man, with the same delicacy of
hand as is peculiar to tailors, and which forms
so marked a contrast to the horny palms of
other workmen. He was tall and thin, and had
that upward look remarkable in all blind men.
His eyes gave no signs of blindness (the pupils
being full and black), except that they appeared
to be directed to no one object, and though fixed,
were so without the least expression of observation.
His long black surtout, though faded in colour, was
far from ragged, having been patched and stitched
in many places, while his cloth waistcoat and
trowsers were clean and neat&mdash;very different from
the garments of street-sellers in general. In his
hand he carried his stick, which, as he sat, he
seemed afraid to part with, for he held it fast
between his knees. He came to me accompanied
by his son, a good-looking rough-headed lad,
habited in a washed-out-blue French kind of
pinafore, and whose duty it was to lead his
blind father about on his rounds. Though the
boy was decently clad, still his clothes, like those
of his father, bore many traces of that respectable
kind of poverty which seeks by continuous
mending to hide its rags from the world. The
face of the father, too, was pinched, while there
was a plaintiveness about his voice that told
of a wretched spirit-broken and afflicted man.
Altogether he was one of the better kind of handicraftsmen&mdash;one
of those fine specimens of the
operatives of this country&mdash;independent even in
their helplessness, scorning to beg, and proud to
be able to give some little equivalent for the
money bestowed on them. I have already given
accounts of the “beaten-out” mechanic from those
who certainly cannot be accused of an excess of sympathy
for the poor&mdash;namely the Poor Law Commissioners
and masters of workhouses; and I can only
add, that all my experience goes fully to bear out
the justice of these statements. As I said before,
the class who are <i>driven</i> to the streets to which
the beaten-out or incapacitated operative belongs,
is, of all others, the most deserving of our sympathy;
and the following biography of one of this order is
given to teach us to look with a kindly eye upon
the many who are forced to become street-sellers as
the sole means of saving themselves from the degradation
of pauperism or beggary.</p>

<p>“I am 45 years of age next June,” said
the blind tailor. “It is upwards of 30 years
since I first went to work at the tailoring trade in
London. I learnt my business under one of the
old hands at Mr. Cook’s, in Poland-street, and
after that went to work at Guthrie’s, in Bond-street.
I belonged to the Society held at the
Old White Hart. I continued working for the
honourable trade and belonging to Society for
about 15 years. My weekly earnings then averaged
1<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> a week while I was at work, and for
several years I was seldom out of work, for when
I got into a shop it was a long time before I got out
again. I was not married then. I lived in a first
floor back room, well-furnished, and could do very
comfortably indeed. I saved often my 15<i>s.</i> or 16<i>s.</i>
in a week, and was worth a good bit of money up
to the time of my first illness. At one period I had
nearly 50<i>l.</i> by me, and had it not been for “vacations”
and “slack seasons” I should have put by
more; but you see to be out of work even a few
weeks makes a large hole in a journeyman’s
savings. All this time I subscribed regularly to
Society, and knew that if I got superannuated I
should be comfortably maintained by the trade.
I felt quite happy with the consciousness of being
provided for in my old age or affliction then, and
if it had not been for that perhaps I might have
saved more even than I did. I went on in this
way, as I said before, for 15 years, and no one
could have been happier than I was&mdash;not a
working man in all England couldn’t. I had
my silver watch and chain. I could lay out my
trifle every week in a few books, and used to have
a trip now and then up and down the river, just
to blow the London smoke off, you know. About
15 years ago my eyes began to fail me without
any pain at all; they got to have as it were a
thick mist, like smoke, before them. I couldn’t see
anything clear. Working by gas-light at first
weakened and at last destroyed the nerve altogether.
I’m now in total darkness. I can only tell
when the gas is lighted by the heat of it.</p>

<p>“It is not the black clothes that is trying to the
sight&mdash;black is the steadiest of all colours to work
at; white and all bright colours makes the eyes
water after looking at ’em for any long time; but of
all colours scarlet, such as is used for regimentals,
is the most blinding, it seems to burn the eyeballs,
and makes them ache dreadful. After
working at red there’s always flying colours
before the eyes; there’s no steady colour to be
seen in anything for some time. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
seems all of a twitter, and to keep changing its
tint. There’s more military tailors blind than any
others. A great number of tailors go blind, but
a great many more has lost their sight since gas-light
has come up. Candle-light was not half so
pernicious to the sight. Gas-light is so very
heating, and there’s such a glare with it that it
makes the eyes throb, and shoot too, if you work
long by it. I’ve often continued working past
midnight with no other light than that, and
then my eyes used to feel like two bits of burning
coals in my head. And you see, sir, the worst of
it was, as I found my sight going bad I was
obliged to try it more, so as to keep up with my
mates in the shop. At last my eyes got so
weak that I was compelled to give up work, and
go into the country, and there I stopped, living
on my savings, and unable to do any work for
fear of losing my sight altogether. I was away
about three years, and then all my money was
gone, and I was obligated, in spite of my eyes, to
go back to work again. But then, with my
sight defective as it was, I could get no employment
at the honourable trade, and so I had to
take a seat in a shop at one of the cheap houses
in the city, and that was the ruin of me entirely;
for working there, of course I got “scratched”
from the trade Society, and so lost all hope of
being provided for by them in my helplessness.
The workshop at this cheap house was both
small and badly ventilated. It was about seven
foot square, and so low, that as you sot on the
floor you could touch the ceiling with the tip
of your finger. In this place seven of us
worked&mdash;three on each side and one in the
middle. Two of my shopmates were boys, or
else I am sure it would not have held us
all. There was no chimney, nor no window that
could be opened to let the air in. It was lighted
by a skylight, and this would neither open nor
shut. The only means for letting out the foul
air was one of them working ventilators&mdash;like
cockades, you know, sir&mdash;fixed in one of the
panes of glass; but this wouldn’t work, so there
we were, often from 5 in the morning till 10 at
night, working in this dreadful place. There was
no fire in the winter, though we never needed
one, for the workshop was over-hot from the
suffocation, and in the summer it was like an
oven. This is what it was in the daytime, but
mortal tongue can’t tell what it was at night, with
the two gas-lights burning away, and almost
stifling us. Many a time some of the men has
been carried out by the others fainting for air.
They all fell ill, every one of them, and I lost
my eyes and my living entirely by it. We spoke
to the master repeatedly, telling him he was
killing us, and though when he came up to the
workshop hisself, he was nearly blown back by
the stench and heat, he would not let us
have any other room to work in&mdash;and yet
he’d plenty of convenience up stairs. He paid
little more than half the regular wages, and
employed such men as myself&mdash;only those who
couldn’t get anything better to do. What with illness
and all, I don’t think my wages there averaged
above 12<i>s.</i> a week: sometimes I could make
1<i>l.</i> in the week, but then, the next week, maybe
I’d be ill, and would get but a few shillings. It
was impossible to save anything then&mdash;even to
pay one’s way was a difficulty, and, at last, I was
seized with rheumatics on the brain, and obliged
to go into St. Thomas’s Hospital. I was there
eleven months, and <i>came out stone blind</i>. I am
convinced I lost my eyesight by working in that
cheap shop; nothing on earth will ever persuade
me to the contrary, and what’s more, my master
robbed me of a third of my wages and my sight
too, and left me helpless in the world, as, God
knows, I am now. It is by the ruin of such men
as me that these masters are enabled to undersell
the better shops; they get hold of the men whose
eyes are just beginning to fail them, like mine did,
because they know they can get them to work cheap,
and then, just at the time when a journeyman requires
to be in the best of shops, have the best of
air, and to work as little by gas-light as possible,
they puts him into a hole of a place that would
stifle a rat, and keeps him working there half the
night through. That’s the way, sir, the cheap
clothes is produced, by making blind beggars of
the workmen, like myself, and throwing us on the
parish in our old age. You are right, sir, they
not only robs the men but the ratepayers too.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as I said, I come out of the hospital
stone blind, and have been in darkness ever
since, and that’s near upon ten years ago. I often
dream of colours, and see the most delightful pictures
in the world; nothing that I ever beheld
with my eyes can equal them&mdash;they’re so brilliant,
and clear and beautiful. I see then the features
and figures of all my old friends, and I can’t tell
you how pleasureable it is to me. When I have
such dreams they so excite me that I am ill all
the next day. I often see, too, the fields, with the
cows grazing on a beautiful green pasture, and the
flowers, just at twilight like, closing up their
blossoms as they do. I never dream of rivers;
nor do I ever remember seeing a field of corn in
my visions; it’s strange I never dreamt in any
shape of the corn or the rivers, but maybe I
didn’t take so much notice of them as of the others.
Sometimes I see the sky, and very often indeed
there’s a rainbow in it, with all kinds of beautiful
colours. The sun is a thing I often dream about
seeing, going down like a ball of fire at the close
of the day. I never dreamt of the stars, nor the
moon&mdash;it’s mostly bright colours that I see.</p>

<p>“I have been under all the oculists I could hear
of&mdash;Mr. Turnbull, in Russell-square, but he did
me no good; then I went to Charing-cross, under
Mr. Guthrie, and he gave me a blind certificate,
and made me a present of half-a-sovereign; he
told me not to have my eyes tampered with again,
as the optic nerve was totally decayed. Oh, yes;
if I had all the riches in the world I’d give them
every one to get my sight back, for it’s the
greatest pressure to me to be in darkness. God
help me! I know I am a sinner, and believe
I’m so afflicted on account of my sins. No, sir,
it’s nothing like when you shut your eyes; when
I had my sight, and closed mine, I remember I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
could still see the light through the lids, the very
same as when you hold your hand up before the
candle; but mine’s far darker than that&mdash;pitch
black. I see a dark mass like before me, and
never any change&mdash;everlasting darkness, and no
chance of a light or shade in this world. But I
feel consolated some how, now it is settled; although
it’s a very poor comfort after all. I go along
the streets in great fear. If a baby have hold
of me, I am firm, but by myself, I reel about
like a drunken man. I feel very timid unless
I have hold of something&mdash;not to support me,
but to assure me I shall not fall. If I was
going down your staircase, sir, I should be all
right so long as I touched the bannister, but if I
missed that, I’m sure I should grow so giddy and
nervous I should fall from the top to the bottom.
After losing my sight, I found a great difficulty
in putting my food into my mouth, for a long
time&mdash;six months or better&mdash;and I was obliged to
have some one to guide my hand, for I used often
to put the fork up to my forehead instead of
my mouth. Shortly after my becoming quite blind,
I found all my other senses much quickened&mdash;my
hearing&mdash;feeling&mdash;and reckoning. I got to like
music very much indeed; it seemed to elevate me&mdash;to
animate and cheer me much more than it
did before, and so much so now, that when it
ceases, I feel duller than ever. It sounds as if it
was in a wilderness to me&mdash;I can’t tell why, but
that’s all I can compare it to; as if I was quite
alone with it. My smell and taste is very acute”
(he was given some violets to smell)&mdash;“Oh, that’s
beautiful,” he cried, “very reviving indeed. Often
of an evening, I can see things in my imagination,
and that’s why I like to sit alone then; for
of all the beautiful thoughts that ever a man
possessed, there’s none to equal a blind man’s,
when he’s by hisself.</p>

<p>“I don’t see my early home, but occurrences
that has recently took place. I see them all plain
before me, in colours as vivid as if I had my
sight again, and the people all dressed in the
fashion of my time; the clothes seem to make a
great impression on me, and I often sit and see in
my mind master tailors trying a coat on a gentleman,
and pulling it here and there. The figures
keep passing before me like soldiers, and often
I’m so took by them that I forget I’m blind, and
turn my head round to look after them as they
pass by me. But that sort of thinking would
throw me into a melancholly&mdash;it’s too exciting
while it lasts, and then leaves me dreadful dull
afterwards. I have got much more melancholy
since my blindness; before then, I was not seriously
given, but now I find great consolation in
religion. I think my blindness is sent to try my
patience and resignation, and I pray to the Almighty
to give me strength to bear with my
affliction. I was quick and hot-tempered before I
was blind, but since then, I have got less hasty
like; all other troubles appears nothing to me.
Sometimes I revile against my affliction&mdash;too frequently&mdash;but
that is at my thoughtless moments,
for when I’m calm and serious, I feel thankful
that the Almighty has touched me with his correcting
rod, and then I’m happy and at peace
with all the world. If I had run my race, and
not been stopped, I might never have believed
there was a God. My wife works at the
‘sank work.’ She makes soldiers’ coats; she
gets 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> for making one, and that’s nearly
a day and a half’s work; then she has to
find her own trimmings, and they’re 1<i>d.</i> It
takes her 16 hours to finish one garment, and
the over-work at that is beginning to make her
like as I was myself. If she takes up a book to
read to me now, it’s all like a dirty mass before
her, and that’s just as my sight was before I lost
it altogether. She slaves hard to help me; she’s
anxious and willing&mdash;indeed too much so. If she
could get constant work, she might perhaps make
about 7<i>s.</i> a week; but as it is, her earnings are,
take one week with another, not more than 3<i>s.</i>
Last week she earned 5<i>s.</i>; but that was the first
job of work she’d had to do for two months. I
think the two of us make on an average about 8<i>s.</i>;
and out of that there is three people to keep&mdash;our
two selves and our boy. Our rent is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, so
that after paying that, we has about 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> left
for food, firing, and clothing for the whole of us.
How we do it I can’t tell; but I know we live
very, very hard: mostly on pieces of bread that
the men gives to me and my boy, as we go round
to the workshops. If we was any of us to fall ill,
we must all go to the parish; if my boy was to
go sick, I should be left without any one to lead
me about, and that would be as bad as if I was
laid-up myself; and if anything was to happen to
my wife, I’d be done clean altogether. But yet
the Lord is very good, and we’d get out of that,
I dare say. If anything was to drive me to the
parish, I should lose all hopes of getting some
help from the blind institutions; and so I dread
the workhouse worse than all. I’d sooner die
on the step of a door, any time, than go there
and be what they call well kept. I don’t know
why I should have a dislike to going there, but
yet I do possess it. I do believe, that any one
that is willing to work for their bread, hates a
workhouse; for the workhouse coat is a slothful,
degrading badge. After a man has had one on
his back, he’s never the same. I would’nt go for
an order for relief so long as I could get a halfpenny
loaf in twenty-four hours. If I could only
get some friend to give me a letter of recommendation
to Mr. Day’s Charity for the Blind, I should
be happy for the rest of my days. I could give
the best of references to any one who would take
pity on me in my affliction.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Public-House Hawkers of Metal
Spoons, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The public-house hawkers are never so prosperous
as those who confine their calling to private
houses; they are often invited to partake of
drink; are not the most industrious class of
hawkers, and, to use their own language, are more
frequently <i>hard up</i> than those who keep away
from tap-room selling. The profits of the small
hawkers in public-houses vary considerably. Some
of them, when they have earned a shilling or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
are content to spend it before they leave the tap-room,
and so they lose both their stock and profit.
I do not mean to infer that this is the case with the
whole of the public-house hawkers, for some among
them strive hard to better their condition, and
occasionally succeed; but there are too many who
are content to drawl out their existence by always
suffering to-morrow to provide for itself. The
man who gave me the routine of small hawkers’
business I found in a tap-room in Ratcliffe
Highway. He was hawking tea-spoons, and all
the stock he possessed was half-a-dozen. These
he importuned me to purchase with great earnestness.
He prayed of me to lay out a trifle with
him. He had not taken a penny the whole day he
said, and had nothing to eat. “What’s much worse
for such as me,” he added, “I’m dying for a glass
of rum.” I might have his tea-spoons, he told me,
at any price. If I would but pay for a glass of rum
for him they should be mine. I assured him some
bread and cheese would do him more good, as
he had not eaten anything that day; but still he
<i>would</i> have the rum. With a trembling hand he
threw the liquor down his throat, smacked his
lips, and said “that there dram has saved my life.”
A few minutes afterwards he sold his spoons to a
customer for sixpence; and he had another glass
of rum. “<i>Now</i>,” said he, “I’m all right for
business; if I’d twopence more I could buy a
dozen tea-spoons, and I should earn a ‘bob’ or
two yet before I went to bed.” After this he
grew communicative, and told me he was as good
a hawker as there was in London, and he thought
he could do more than any other man with a
small stock. He had two or three times resolved
to better himself, and had ‘<i>put in the pin</i>,’ meaning
he had made a vow to refrain from drinking;
but he had broken out again and gone on
in his old course until he had melted the whole of
his stock, though twice it had, during his sobriety,
amounted to 5<i>l.</i>, and was often worth between
2<i>l.</i> and 3<i>l.</i> It was almost maddening when he
came to his senses, he said, to find he had acted so
foolishly; indeed, it was so disheartening to discover
all the result of his good resolutions dissipated in a
moment, that he declared he never intended to try
again. After having drunk out his stock, he would
if possible commence with half-a-dozen Britannia
metal tea-spoons; these cost him 6<i>d.</i>, and would
sell for 9<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> When one half-dozen were disposed
of he would procure another, adding a knife,
or a comb or two. If entirely destitute, he would
stick a needle in a cork, and request to know of
“the parties” assembled in some tap-room, if they
wanted anything in the ironmongery line, though
the needle was all the stock he had. This was
done for the purpose of “raising the wind;” and
by it he would be sure to obtain a glass or two of
ale if he introduced himself with his “ironmongery
establishment” among the sailors. Sometimes
he would manage to beg a few pence,
and then he would purchase a knife, pair of
braces, or half-a-dozen tea-spoons, and begin to
practise his trade in a legitimate manner. In answer
to my inquiry he said he had not always
been a hawker. His father had been a soldier,
and he had worked in the armoury. His father
had been discharged upon a pension, and he (the
hawker) left the army with his parents. He had
never enlisted while his father was a soldier, but
he had since. His mother adopted the business
of a hawker upon the receipt of his father’s first
quarter’s pension; and then he used to accompany
her on her rounds. With the pension and the
mother’s exertions they managed to subsist tolerably
well. “Being the only child, I was foolishly
spoilt by my parents,” he said; “and when I
was a very young man&mdash;15 or 16&mdash;I became a
great trouble to them. At 18 I enlisted in
the 7th Fusileers, remained in the regiment three
months, and then, at my own request, was
bought off. My mother sold off most of her
stock of goods to raise the money (twenty pounds).
When I returned home I could not think of
trudging by my mother’s side, as I had been used
to do when carrying the goods; nor did I feel
inclined to exert myself in any way for my own
support. I considered my mother had a right to
keep me without my working, and she, poor thing,
thought so too. I was not only supported in idleness,
but my mother would give me many a
shilling, though she could ill afford it, for me to
spend with my companions. I passed most of my
time in a skittle ground. I was not what you
might term a skittle sharp, for I never entered
into a plot to victimise any person, although I
confess I have often bet upon the ‘greenness’ of
those who were silly enough to make wagers that
they could not possibly win. Sometimes, after I had
lost the trifle supplied me by my mother, I would
return, and be blackguard enough to assume the
bully unless my demands on her for a further
supply were attended to. Poor thing, she was
very meek, and with tears in her eyes she would
grant my request. I often weep when I think
how I treated her” (here the tears trickled down
the man’s cheek), “and yet, badly as I used her,
in my heart I loved her very much. I got
tired of the skittle grounds in consequence
of getting into a hobble relative to a skittle
swindle: some sharpers had obtained a flat; I
was speculating in a small way, betting pennies
and twopences in such a manner as always
to win; I was practising upon the flat upon my
own account, without having any connection with
the others; they fleeced their dupe out of several
pounds, and he made a row about it. The police
interfered, and I was singled out as one of the
gang; the principals were also apprehended; they
got six months each, and I was accommodated
with a month’s board and lodging at the expense
of the nation. I thought this at the time unjust,
but I was as culpable as any of them, for at
the time I only regretted I had not more money to
stake larger wagers, and envied the other parties
who were making a better thing of the business
than I was. When I came out of jail, my
poor mother treated me as a martyr. She thought
I was as innocent as a child. Shortly after my
release from prison my father died, and with him
went the pension of course. I was then obligated
to do something for myself. A few shillings’ worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of goods only were procured&mdash;for my father’s funeral
and my extravagances had sadly crippled my
mother’s means. I behaved very well for a short
time. My mother then was often ill, and she
never recovered the death of my father. In
about a year after my father died I lost my
mother; our stock of goods had dwindled down
to a very poor lot, and I was obligated to ask relief
of the parish towards her funeral expenses. When
all was over, the value of my goods and cash
did not amount to 20<i>s.</i> Ten years have elapsed
since my mother’s death, and I don’t think I have
ever been, during the whole period, sober for a
month together.”</p>

<p>While I sat in this tap-room, I counted in the
course of an hour and a quarter,&mdash;4 hawkers of
sheep’s trotters, who visited the place; 3 sellers
of shrimps, pickled whelks, and periwinkles;
2 baked potato-sellers; 8 song-hawkers; the same
number with lucifer matches; and 3 with braces,
&amp;c. Not one of these effected a sale.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Jewellery.</span></h3>

<p>The jewellery now sold in the streets far exceeds,
both in cheapness and quality, what was
known even ten years ago. Fifty years ago the
jewellery itinerant trade was almost entirely, if
not entirely, in the hands of Jews, who at any
rate professed to sell really gold articles, and who
asked large prices; but these traders have lost
their command over this, as I have shown that they
have over other street callings, as not a twelfth of
the street-jewellers are now Jews. A common
trade among such street and country itinerant
jewellers was in large watch seals, the bodies of
which were of lead, more or less thickly plated
with gold, and which were unsaleable even as old
metal until broken to pieces,&mdash;but not always saleable
then. The street or itinerant trade was for
a long time afterwards carried on only by those
who were regularly licensed as hawkers, and who
preferred “barter” or “swopping” to actual sale,
the barter being usually for other and more solid
articles of the goldsmith’s trade.</p>

<p>The introduction of “mosaic” and other cheap
modes of manufacturing <i>quasi</i> gold ornaments,
brought about considerable changes in the trade,
pertaining, however, more to the general manufacture,
than to that prepared for the streets.</p>

<p>The itinerants usually carry their wares in
boxes or cases, which shut up close, and can be
slung on the shoulder for conveyance, or hung
round the neck for the purposes of sale. These
cases are nearly all glazed; within them the
jewellery is disposed in such manner as, in the
street-seller’s judgment, is the most attractive. A
card of the larger brooches, or of cameos, often
forms the centre, and the other space is occupied
with the shawl-pins, with their globular tops of
scarlet or other coloured glass: rings, armlets,
necklaces, a few earrings and ear-drops, and
sometimes a few side-combs, small medals for
keepsakes, clasps, beads, and bead-purses, ornamental
buttons for dresses, gilt buckles for waist-belts,
thimbles, &amp;c., constitute the street jeweller’s
stock-in-trade. The usual prices are from 2<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; the price most frequently obtained for
any article being 3<i>d.</i> It will be seen from the
enumeration of the articles, that the stock is such
as is required “for women’s wear,” and women
are now almost the sole customers of the street-jewellers.
“In my time, sir,” said one elderly
street-trader, “or rather, when I was a boy, and
in my uncle’s time&mdash;for he was in jewellery, and
I helped him at times&mdash;quite different sorts of
jewellery was sold, and quite different prices was
had; what’s a high figure now was a low figure
then. I’ve known children’s coral and bells in
my uncle’s stock&mdash;well, I don’t know whether it
was real coral or not&mdash;and big watch keys with
coloured stones in the centre on ’em, such as I’ve
seen old gents keep spinning round when they
was talking, and big seals and watch-chains;
there weren’t no guards then, as I remember.
And there was plated fruit-knives&mdash;silver, as near
as a toucher&mdash;and silver pencils (pencil-cases), and
gilt lockets, to give your sweetheart your hair in
for keepsakes. Lor’ bless you! times is turned
upside down.”</p>

<p>The disposition of the street-stalls is somewhat
after the same fashion as that in the itinerant’s
box, with the advantage of a greater command of
space. Some of the stalls&mdash;one in Tottenham-court
Road, I may instance, and another in Whitechapel&mdash;make
a great show.</p>

<p>I did not hear of any in this branch of the
jewellery trade who had been connected with it
as working jewellers. I heard of two journeymen
watchmakers and four clockmakers now
selling jewellery (but often with other things, such
as eye-glasses) in the street, but that is all. The
street mass selling jewellery in town and country
are, I believe, composed of the various classes who
constitute the street-traders generally.</p>

<p>Of the nature of his present trade, and of the
class of his customers, I had the following account
from a man of twelve years’ experience in
the vending of street <span class="lock">jewellery:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It’s not very easy to tell, sir,” he said, “what
sells best, for people begins to suspect everything,
and seems to think they’re done if they give 3<i>d.</i>
for an agate brooch, and finds out it ain’t set in
gold. I think agate is about the best part of the
trade now. It seems a stone as is easy imitated.
Cornelians, too, ain’t so bad in brooches&mdash;people
likes the colour; but not what they was, and not
up to agates. But nothing is up to what it once
was; not in the least. Sell twice as much&mdash;when
you can, which often stands over till to-morrow
come-never&mdash;and get half the profit. I don’t expect
very much from the Great Exhibition. They
sends goods so cheap from Germany, they’ll think
anything dear in London, if it’s only at German
prices. I think it’s a mistake to fancy that the
cheaper a jewellery article is the more you’ll sell
of it. You won’t. People’s of opinion&mdash;at
least that’s my notion of it&mdash;that it’s so common
everybody’ll have it, and so they won’t touch it.
It’s Thames water, sir, against beer, is poor low-priced
jewellery, against tidy and fair-priced; but
then the low-priced has now ruined the other sorts,
for they’re all thought to go under the same umbrella,&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of a sort; 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>d.</i> Why, as to
who’s the best customers, that depends on where
you pitches your pitch, or works your round, and
whether you are known, or are merely a upstart.
But I can tell you, sir, who’s been my best customers&mdash;and
is yet, but not so good as they was&mdash;and
that’s women of the town; and mostly (for
I’ve tried most places) about Ratcliff Highway,
Whitechapel, Mile-end-road, Bethnal-green, and
Oxford-street. The sailors’ gals is the best of all;
but a’most all of them is very particular, and
some is uncommon tiresome. ‘I’m afeard,’ they
says, ‘this colour don’t suit my complexion; it’s
too light, or it’s too dark. How does that ring
show on my finger?’ I’ve known some of the fat
and fair ones&mdash;what had been younger, but would
be older&mdash;say, ‘Let me have a necklace of bright
black beads;’ them things shows best with the fat
’uns&mdash;but in gen’ral them poor creatures is bad
judges of what becomes them. The things they’re
the most particular of all in is necklaces. Amber
and pearl sells most. I have them from 6<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I never get more than 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Cornelian
necklaces is most liked by children, and most
bought for them. I’ve trusted the women of the
town, and trust them still. One young woman in
Shadwell took a fancy the t’other week for a
pearl necklace, ‘it became her so,’ which it didn’t;
and offered to pay me 6<i>d.</i> a week for it if I
wouldn’t sell it away from her. The first week
she paid 6<i>d.</i>; the second nothing; and next week
the full tip, ’cause her Jack had come home. I
never lost a halfpenny by the women. Yes, they
pays you a fairish price, but nothing more. Sometimes
they’ve beat me down 1<i>d.</i>, and has said, ‘It’s
all the money I has.’</p>

<p>“It’s not very long ago that one of them offered
me a fine goold watch which I could have bought
at any price, for I saw she knew nothing of what
it was worth. I never do anything that way. I
believe a very few in my line does, for they can’t
give the prices the rich fences can. It’s common
enough for them gals to ask any street-jeweller
they knows how much a watch ought to pop for,
or to sell for, afore they tries it on. But it isn’t
they as tries it on, sir; they gets some respeckbel
old lady, or old gent, to do that for them. I’ve
had cigars and Cavendish of them; such as seamen
had left behind them; you know, sir, I’ve
never given money, only jewellery for it. Plenty
of shopkeepers is glad to buy it of me, and not at
a bad price. They asks no questions, and I tells
them no lies. One reason why these gals buys
free is that when the jewellery gets out of order
or out of fashion, they can fling it away and get
fresh, it’s so cheap. When I’ve had no money
on a day until I has sold to these women, I’ve oft
enough said, ‘God bless ’em!’ Earrings is
hardly any go now, sir; nothing to what they
was; they’re going out. The penny jewellery’s
little good; it’s only children what buys, or gets
it bought for them. I sell most of brooches from
3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>, very seldom higher, and bracelets&mdash;they
calls them armlets now&mdash;at the same price.
I buys all my goods at a swag-shop: there’s no
other market. Watchguards was middling sale,
both silver and goold, or washed white and washed
yellow, and the swags made money in them; but
instead of 1<i>s.</i>, they’re not to be sold at a Joey
now, watchguards ain’t, if a man patters ever so.”</p>

<p>I am informed that there are not less than 1000
individuals who all buy their jewellery at the
London swag-shops, and sell it in the streets, with
or without other articles, but principally without;
and that of this number 500 are generally in London
and its suburbs, including such places as
Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich. Of these
traders about one-tenth are women; and in town
about three-fifths are itinerant, and the others
stationary. One-half, or thereabouts, of the women,
are the wives of street-sellers; the others
trade on their own account. A few “swop”
jewellery for old clothes, with either the mistress
or the maids. Four or five, when they see a favourable
opportunity, offer to tell any servant-maid
her fortune. “‘Buy this beautiful agate
brooch, my dear,’ the woman’ll say, ‘and I’ll
only charge you 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’&mdash;a German thing, sir,
costing her seven farthings one street-jeweller informed
me,&mdash;‘and I’ll tell you your fortune into
the bargain.’”</p>

<p>One “old hand” calculated, that when a street-jeweller
could display 50<i>s.</i> worth of stock, he
could clear, all the year round, 15<i>s.</i> a week.
“People,” said this man, “as far as I’ve known
the streets, like to buy of what they think is a
respectable man, and seemingly well to do; they
feel safe with him.” Those, however, who cannot
boast so large a stock of jewellery as 50<i>s.</i>
worth, may only clear 10<i>s.</i> instead of 15<i>s.</i> weekly.
One trader thought that the average earnings of
his fraternity might be taken at 12<i>s.</i> a week;
another&mdash;and both judged from their own experience&mdash;thought
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was high enough.
Calculating, then, at a weekly profit of 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and a receipt of 18<i>s.</i> per individual, we find
23,400<i>l.</i> expended in the street-trade, including
the sales at Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich;
where&mdash;both places being resorted to by
pleasure-seekers and seamen&mdash;the trade is sometimes
considerable; watches, which now are almost
unknown in a regular street-trade, there
forming an occasional part of it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of The Pedlar-Jewellers.</span></h3>

<p>I have heard a manufacturer of Birmingham
jewellery assert, that one pound of copper was
sufficient to make 10<i>l.</i> worth of jewellery; consequently,
the material to provide the unmanufactured
stock in trade of a wholesale dealer in Birmingham
jewellery, is not over expensive. It
may be imagined then that the pedlars who hawk
jewellery do not invest a very great capital in
the wares they sell; there are some few, however,
who have very valuable stocks of goods,
pedlars though they be. This trade is principally
pursued by Jews, and to a great extent
(especially in a small way) by foreign Jews.
The Jews are, I think, more attentive to the
wants of their poorer brethren than other people;
and instead of supplying them with trifling
sums of money, which must necessarily soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
expended, they give them small quantities of
goods, so that they may immediately commence
foraging for their own support. Many of these
poor Jews, when provided with their stock of
merchandise, can scarcely speak a word of English,
and few of them know but little respecting
the value of the goods they sell; they always
take care to ask a good price, leaving plenty of
room for abatement. I heard one observe that
they could not easily be taken in by being overcharged,
for according what they paid for the
article they fixed the price upon it. Some of
these men, notwithstanding their scanty knowledge
of the trade at starting, have eventually become
excellent judges of jewellery; some of them,
moreover, have acquired riches in it; indeed from
the indomitable perseverance of the Hebrew race,
success is generally the result of their untiring
industry. If once you look at the goods of
a Jew pedlar, it is not an easy matter to get out
of his clutches; it is not for want of perseverance
if he does not bore and tease you, until at
length you are glad to purchase some trifle to get
rid of him. One of my informants tells me he is
acquainted with several Jews, who now hold their
heads high as merchants, and are considered
very excellent judges of the wares they deal
in, who originally began trading with but a small
stock of jewellery, and that a charitable donation.
As well as Jews there are Irishmen
who deal in such commodities. The pedlar generally
has a mahogany box bound with brass, and
which he carries with a strap hung across his
shoulder; when he calls at a house, an inquiry is
made whether there is any old silver or gold to
dispose of. “I will give you a full price for any
such articles.” If the lady or gentleman accosted
seems to be likely to buy, the box is immediately
opened and a tempting display of gold rings,
chains, scent-boxes, lockets, brooches, breast-pins,
bracelets, silver thimbles, &amp;c., &amp;c., are exposed to
view. All the eloquence the pedlar can command
is now brought into play. The jewellery is arranged
about the persons of his expected customers
to the best advantage. The pedlar says all he
can think of to enhance their sale: he will chop
and change for anything they may wish to dispose
of&mdash;any old clothes, books, or useless lumber may
be converted into ornaments for the hair or other
parts of dress. The Irish pedlar mostly confines
his visits to the vicinity of large factories where
there are many girls employed; these he supplies
with earrings, necklaces, shawl-pins, brooches,
lockets, &amp;c., which are bought wholesale at the
following prices:&mdash;Earrings and drops at from
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> per dozen pairs; the 3<i>d.</i> earring is
a neat little article says my informant, and those
sold at 1<i>s.</i> each, wholesale, are gorgeous-looking
affairs; many of the latter have been disposed of
by the pedlars at 1<i>l.</i> the pair, and even a greater
price. Necklaces are from 5<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> per dozen.
Lockets may be purchased wholesale at from 2<i>s.</i> to
10<i>s.</i> per dozen; guard chains (German silver) are
4<i>s.</i> per dozen; gilt heavy-looking waistcoat chains
6<i>s.</i> per dozen: and all other articles are equally
low in price. The pedlar jeweller can begin business
“respectably” for two pounds. His box costs
him 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; half-a-dozen pairs of earrings of six
different sorts, 3<i>s.</i>; half-a-dozen lockets (various),
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; half-a-dozen guard chains, 2<i>s.</i>; half-a-dozen
shawl brooches, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; one dozen breast-pins
(different kinds), 3<i>s.</i>; one dozen finger rings of
various descriptions, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; half-a-dozen brooches
at 4<i>d.</i> each, 2<i>s.</i>; one dozen necklaces (a variety),
at 6<i>s.</i>; three silver pencil-cases at 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> each,
5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; half-a-dozen waistcoat chains, 3<i>s.</i>; one
silver toothpick, at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> These make altogether
two pounds. If the articles are arranged
with taste and seeming care (as if they were very
valuable), with jeweller’s wadding under each,
and stuck on pink cards, &amp;c., while the finger
rings are inserted in the long narrow velvet-lined
groove of the box, and the other “valuables”
well spread about the little portable shop&mdash;they
may be made to assume a very respectable and
almost “rich” appearance. Many who now have
large establishments commenced life with much
less stock than is here mentioned. The Jews, I do
not think, continues my informant, are the best
salesmen; and the fact of their being Israelites is,
in many instances, a bar to their success; country
people, especially, are afraid of being taken in by
them. The importunities and appeals of the Hebrew,
however, are far more urgent than any other
tradesman; and they always wait where they
think there’s the slightest chance of effecting a
sale, until the door is slammed in their face. I
believe there are not, at the present time, many
(especially small traders) who deal exclusively in
jewellery; they mostly add other small and light
articles&mdash;such as fancy cutlery, side combs, &amp;c.
There may, at a rough guess, be 500 of them travelling
the country; half the number are poor
foreign Jews; a quarter are Jews, who have, perhaps,
followed the same calling for years; and the
remaining quarter, a mixture of Irish and English,
with a small preponderance of Irishmen. All
these “swop” their goods for old gold and silver,
and frequently realize a large sum, by changing
the base metal for the sterling article. Their
goods are always sold as being gold or silver&mdash;If
asked whether a particular article be gold, they
reply “It’s jewellers’ gold;” “Is this ring gold?”
inquires the customer, taking one from the box&mdash;“No,
ma’am, I wouldn’t deceive you!” is the
answer, “<i>that</i> is not gold; but here is one,” adds
the pedlar (taking up one exactly of the same
description, and which cost the same price) “which
is of a similar shape and fashion, and the best
jeweller’s gold that is made.” The profits of the
pedlar-jewellers it is almost impossible to calculate,
for they will sell at any price upon which the
smallest amount of profit can be realized. The
foreign Jews, especially, will do this, and it is not
an unusual circumstance for one of these men to
ask 5<i>s.</i> for an article which originally cost them
3<i>d.</i>, and which they will eventually sell for 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>In London there are about 200 hawkers of
jewellery, who visit the public-houses; but few of
these have boxes&mdash;they invite customers by displaying
some chains in their hands, or having one
or two arranged in front of their waistcoats, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the smaller articles are carried in their waistcoat
pockets. The class of persons who patronize the
public-house hawkers are those who visit the tap-rooms
of taverns, and countrymen in the vicinity
of Smithfield upon market days, (one of the hawkers
tells me, that they succeed better upon the
hay-market days than at the cattle sales, for the
butchers, they say, are too “fly” for them). Sailors
are among their best customers, but the coster-girls
are very fond of drop earrings and coral
beads; the sailors, however, give the best prices
of all. I am told that the quantity of old
gold and silver which the country pedlars
obtain in exchange for their goods is “astonishing;”
and there have been occasions on which a
pedlar has been enriched for life by one single
transaction of barter; some old and unfashionable
piece of jewellery, that they received for their
goods, has been composed of costly stones, which
had lain by for years, and of which the pedlar’s
customer was unacquainted with the value. The
more respectable jewellery pedlars put up at the
better class of public-houses, and, even after their
day’s travels are over, they still have an eye to
business; they open the box upon the table of the
tap-room where they are lodging, and, under the
pretence of cleaning or arranging their goods,
temptingly display their glittering stock. The
bar-maid, kitchen-maid, the landlady’s daughter,
or perhaps the landlady herself, admires some
ornaments, which the pedlar declares would become
them vastly. He hangs a necklace upon the neck
of one of them; holds a showy earring and drop
to the ear of another; facetiously inquires of the
girls whether they are not likely to want something
of this sort shortly&mdash;as he holds up first a
wedding-ring, and then a baby’s coral; or else he
exhibits a ring set with Turquoise, or pearls and
small diamonds in a cluster, to the landlady, and
tries it on her finger; and by such arts a sale that
will cover his expenses is generally effected.
There is one peculiarity these men have when
bartering their goods. A worn-out ornament of
jewellery is brought to them, and, although it be
brass, the pedlar never attempts to undeceive the
possessor, if he finds it is considered to be genuine.
Of course he never gives cash for such articles;
but he offers a large price in barter. “I will take
10<i>s.</i> for this ring, and allow you 5<i>s.</i> for the old
one,” says the pedlar. It would never do to say
the ornament was not gold; the customer bought
it years ago for such, and no one ever disputed its
being the precious metal; should our pedlar do
so, he might as well shut up shop immediately.
The lady would be angry and suspicious; neither
would she believe him, but rather suspect that he
wanted only to cheat her; consequently the pedlar
barters, obtains the old ring, or some other article,
and 5<i>s.</i>, for his commodity; and though the article
he has taken in exchange is worth only a few
pence, he very likely profits to the amount of 200
per cent. upon the cash received. The pedlars of
lesser consequence put up at humble private or
public-houses, and some of them at the common
lodging-houses. Those who have only small stocks
confine their visits to farm-houses and villages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Card-Counters,
Medals, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The “card-counters,” or, as I have heard them
sometimes called by street-sellers, the “small
coins,” are now of a very limited sale. The
slang name for these articles is “Jacks” and
“Half Jacks.” They are sold to the street-people
at only two places in London; one in Holborn,
and the other at Black Tom’s (himself formerly a
street-seller, now “a small swag”), in Clerkenwell.
They are all made in Birmingham, and are
of the size and colour of the genuine sovereigns
and half sovereigns; but it is hardly possible that
any one who had ever received a sovereign in
payment, could be deceived by the substitution of
a Jack. Those now sold in the streets are much
thinner, and very much lighter. Each presents a
profile of the Queen; but instead of the superscription
“Victoria Dei Gratiâ” of the true sovereign,
the Jack has “Victoria Regina.” On the
reverse, in the place of the “Britanniarum Regina
Fid. Def.” surrounding the royal arms and crown,
is a device (intended for an imitation of St. George
and the Dragon) representing a soldier on horseback&mdash;the
horse having three legs elevated from
the ground, while a drawn sword fills the right
hand of the equestrian, and a crown adorns his
head. The superscription is, “to Hanover,” and
the rider seems to be sociably accompanied by a
dragon. Round the Queen’s head on the half
Jack is “Victoria, Queen of Great Britain,” and
on the reverse the Prince of Wales’s feather, with
the legend, “The Prince of Wales’s Model Half
Sovereign.”</p>

<p>Until within these five or six years the gilt
card-counters had generally the portraiture of the
monarch, and on the reverse the legend “Keep
your temper,” as a seasonable admonition to whist
players. Occasionally the card-counter was a gilt
coin, closely resembling a sovereign; but the
magistracy, eight or nine years back, “put down”
the sale of these imitations.</p>

<p>Under another head will be found an account
of the use made of these sovereigns, in pretended
wagers. A further use of them was to add to the
heaps of apparent gold at the back of the table-keeper
in a race booth, when gambling was
allowed at Epsom, and the “great meetings.”</p>

<p>There are now only two men regularly selling
Jacks in the streets. There have been as many as
twelve. One of these street-sellers is often found
in Holborn, announcing “30<i>s.</i> for 1<i>d.</i>! 30<i>s.</i> for 1<i>d.</i>!
cheapest bargain ever offered; 30<i>s.</i> for 1<i>d.</i>!”</p>

<p>The Jacks cost, wholesale, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the gross;
the half Jacks 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> The two are sold for 1<i>d.</i>
If the sale be not brisk, the street-seller will give a
ring into the bargain. These rings cost 1<i>s.</i> the
gross, or the third part of a farthing each.</p>

<p>If there be, on the year’s average, only two
street-sellers disposing of the Jacks, and earning
9<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;to earn which the receipts will be
about 20<i>s.</i>&mdash;we find 104<i>l.</i> expended in the streets
on these trifles.</p>

<p>Of medals the street sale is sometimes considerable,
at others a mere nothing. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
popular subject is before the public, many of the
general patterers “go to medals.” I could not
learn that any of the present street-people vended
medals in the time of the war; I believe there are
none at present among the street folk who did so.
I am told that the street sale in war medals was
smaller than might reasonably have been expected.
The manufacture of those articles in the Salamanca,
Vittoria, and even Waterloo days, was greatly
inferior to what it is at present, and the street
price demanded was as often 6<i>d.</i> as a smaller sum.
These medals in a little time presented a dull,
leaden look, and the knowledge that they were
“poor things” seems to have prevented the public
buying them to any extent in the streets, and
perhaps deterred the street-sellers from offering
them. Those who were the most successful of
the medal-sellers had been, or assumed to have
been, soldiers or seamen.</p>

<p>Within the last eighteen years, or more, there
has hardly been any public occurrence without a
comparatively well-executed medal being sold in
the streets in commemoration of it. That sold at
the opening of London-bridge was, I am told,
considered “a superior thing,” and the improvement
in this art of manufacture has progressed to
the present time. Within the last three years the
most saleable medals, an experienced man told me,
were of Hungerford Suspension (bridge), the New
Houses of Parliament, the Chinese Junk, and Sir
Robert Peel. The Thames Tunnel medals were
at one time “very tidy,” as were those of the New
Royal Exchange. The great sale is at present of
the Crystal Palace; and one man had heard that
there were a great many persons coming to London
to sell them at the opening of the Great Exhibition.
“The great eggs and bacon, I call it,” he
said; “for I hope it will bring us that sort of
grub. But I don’t know; I’m afraid there’ll
be too many of us. Besides, they say we shan’t
be let sell in the park.”</p>

<p>The exhibition medal is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>What the street medal-sellers call the “right-side”&mdash;I
speak of the “penny” medal, which
commands by far the greatest sale&mdash;presents the
Crystal Palace, raised from the surface of the
medal, and whitened by the application of aqua
fortis. The superscription is “<span class="smcap lowercase">THE BUILDING FOR
THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, LONDON, 1851</span>.”
On the “wrong side” (so called) is the following
inscription, occupying the whole face of the medal:</p>

<p class="center">
THE CONSTRUCTION IS OF<br />
IRON AND OF GLASS,<br />
1848 FEET LONG.<br />
ABOUT HALF IS 456 WIDE.<br />
THE REMAINDER 408 FEET WIDE,<br />
AND 66 FEET HIGH;<br />
SITE, UPWARDS OF 20 ACRES.<br />
COST £150,000.<br />
JOSH. PAXTON, ARCHT.<br />
</p>

<p>The size of this medal is between that of a
shilling and a half-crown.</p>

<p>A patterer, who used to sell medals on Sunday
mornings in the park, informed me that he told
his customers the Crystal Palace part was dead
silver, by a new discovery making silver cheap;
but for all that he would risk changing it for a
four-penny bit!</p>

<p>The two-penny medal is after the same style,
but the letters are more distinct. On my stating,
to a medal-seller, that it was difficult to read the
inscription on his “pennies,” he said, “Not at all,
sir; but it’s your eyes is dazzled.” This was
said quietly, and with a touch of slyness, and I
have no doubt was the man’s “cut-and-dried”
answer.</p>

<p>The patterer whom I have mentioned, told me,
that encouraged by a tolerable sale and “a gathering
of the aristocrats,” on a very fine Sunday in
January or February&mdash;he could not remember
which&mdash;he ventured upon 6 “sixpenny medals,”
costing him 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> He sold them all but one,
which he showed me. It was exactly the size of
a crown-piece. The Crystal Palace was “raised,”
and of “dead silver,” as in the smaller medals.
The superscription was the same as on the penny
medal; but underneath the representation of the
palace were raised figures of Mercury and of a
naked personage, with a quill as long as himself,
a cornucopia, and a bee-hive: this I presume was
Industry. These twin figures are supporters to a
medallion, crown-surmounted, of the Queen and
Prince Albert: being also in “dead silver.” On
the reverse was an inscription, giving the dimensions,
&amp;c., of the building.</p>

<p>The medals in demand for street-sale in London
seem to be those commemorative of local events
only. None, for instance, were sold relating to
the opening of the Britannia Bridge.</p>

<p>The wholesale price of the medals retailed in
the street at 1<i>d.</i> is 7<i>s.</i> the gross; those retailed at
2<i>d.</i> are 12<i>s.</i> the gross, but more than three-fourths
of those sold are penny medals. They are all
bought at the swag-shops, and are all made in
Birmingham. It is difficult to compute how many
persons are engaged in this street trade, for many
resort to it only on occasions. There are, however,
from 12 to 20 generally selling medals, and at the
present time about 30 are so occupied: they, however,
do not sell medals exclusively, but along with
a few articles of jewellery, or occasionally of such
street stationery as letter stamps and “fancy”
pens, with coloured glass or china handles. A
fourth of the number are women. The weather
greatly influences the street medal trade, as rain
or damp dims their brightness. One seller told me
that the day before I saw him he had sold only
four medals. “I’ve known the trade, off and on,” he
said, “for about six years, and the greatest number
as ever I sold was half-a-gross one Saturday. I
cleared rather better than 3<i>s.</i> I sold them in
Whitehall and by Westminster-bridge. There
was nothing new among them, but I had a good
stock, and it was a fine day, and I was lucky in
meeting parties, and had a run for sets.” By a
“run for sets,” my informant meant that he had
met with customers who bought a medal of each
of the kinds he displayed; this is called “a set.”</p>

<p>An intelligent man, familiar with the trade,
and who was in the habit of clubbing his stock-money
with two others, that they might buy a
gross at a time, calculated that 15 medal sellers
were engaged in the traffic the year through, and
earned, in medals alone, 6<i>d.</i> a day each, to clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
which they would take 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, giving a
yearly outlay of 253<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> It must be remembered,
to account for the smallness of the earnings,
that the trade in medals is irregular, and the
calculation embraces all the seasons of the trade.</p>

<p>On occasions when medals are the sole or chief
articles of traffic, they are displayed on a tray,
which is a box with a lid, and thus look bright
as silver on the faded brown velvet, with
which the box is often lined. Among the favourite
pitches are Oxford-street, the approaches
to London, Blackfriars, Westminster, and Waterloo-bridges,
the railway stations, and the City-road.</p>

<p>Of small coins (proper) there is now no sale in
the streets. When there was an issue of half-farthings,
about seven years ago, the street-sellers
drove a brisk trade, in vending them at four a
penny, urging on the sale before the coins got into
circulation, which they never did. “It’s not
often,” said one patterer to me, “that <i>we</i> has
anything to thank the Government for, but we
may thank them for the half-farthings. I dare say
at least 30 of us made a tidy living on them for a
week or more; and if they wasn’t coined just to
give us a spirt, I should like to know what they
<i>was</i> coined for! I once myself, sir, for a lark,
gave one to a man that swept a capital crossing,
and he was in a thundering passion, and wanted
to fight me, when I told him they was coined to
pay the likes of him!”</p>

<p>There was afterwards a tolerable sale of the
“new silver pennies, just issued from the Mint,
three ha’pence each, or 7 for 6<i>d.</i>;” also of “genuine
models of the new English florin, only 1<i>d.</i>:”
both of these were fictitious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Rings and
Sovereigns for Wagers.</span></h3>

<p>This class is hardly known in the streets of
London at present. Country fairs and races are
a more fitting ground for the ring-seller’s operations.
One man of this class told me that he had
been selling rings, and occasionally medals, for
wagers for this last fifteen years. “It’s only
a so-so game just now,” he said; “the people get
so fly to it. A many hold out their penny for
a ring, and just as I suppose I’m a going to receive
it, they put the penny into their pockets, and their
thumb upon their nose. I wish I had some other
game, for this is a very dickey one. I gives 3<i>d.</i>
a-dozen for the rings at the swag shop; and sometimes
sells a couple of dozen in a day, but seldom
more. Saturday is no better day than any other.
Country people are my best customers. I know
them by their appearance. Sometimes a person in
the crowd whispers to others that he bought one the
other day and went and pawned it for 5<i>s.</i>, and he’d
buy another, but he’s got no money. I don’t ask for
such assistance; I suppose it’s done for a lark, and
to laugh at others if they buy. Women buy more
frequently than any one else. Several times since
I have been on this dodge, women have come back
and abused me because the ring they bought for a
penny was not gold. Some had been to the pawn
shop, and was quite astonished that the pawnbroker
wouldn’t take the ring in. I do best in
the summer at races: people think it more likely
that two sporting gents would lay an out of
the way wager (as you know I always make out)
then than at any other time. I have been interfered
with at races before now for being an
impostor, and yet at the same time the gamblers
was allowed to keep their tables; but of course
theirs was all fair&mdash;no imposition about them&mdash;oh
no! I am considered one of the best
patterers among our lot. I dare say there may be
twenty on us all together, in town and country,
on rings and sovereigns. Sometimes, when travelling
on foot to a race or fair, I do a little in
the <i>Fawney dropping</i> line;” (fawneys are rings;)
“but that is a dangerous game, I never did it but
two or three times. There were some got lagged
for it, and that frightened me. In ring-dropping
we pretend to have found a ring, and ask some
simple-looking fellow if it’s good gold, as it’s only
just picked up. Sometimes it is immediately pronounced
<i>gold</i>: ‘Well it’s no use to me,’ we’ll
say, ‘will you buy it?’ Often they are foolish
enough to buy, and it’s some satisfaction to one’s
conscience to know that they think they are a
taking you in, for they give you only a shilling or
two for an article which if really gold would be
worth eight or ten. Some ring-droppers write out an
account and make a little parcel of jewellery, and
when they pick out their man, they say, ‘If you
please, sir, will you read this for me, and tell me
what I should do with these things, as I’ve just
found them?’ Some people advise they should be
taken to the police office&mdash;but very few say that;
some, that they should be taken to the address;
others, that they should be sold, and the money
shared; others offer a price for them, stating that
they’re not gold, they’re only trumpery they
say, but they’ll give half-a-crown for them. It’s
pleasant to take such people in. Sometimes the
finder says he’s in haste, and will sell them
for anything to attend to other business, and
he then transfers his interest at perhaps 200 per
cent. profit. This game won’t friz now, sir, it’s
very dangerous. I’ve left it off long since. I
don’t like the idea of quod. I’ve been there once.”
Another plan of dropping rings is to write a letter.
This is the <span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“My dear Anne,<br />
</p>

<p>“I have sent you the ring, and hope it will fit.&mdash;Excuse
me not bringing it. John will leave it with you.&mdash;You
know I have so much to attend to.&mdash;I shall think
every minute a year until the happy day arrives.</p>

<p class="sig">
“Yours devotedly,<br />
“<span class="smcap">James Brown</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>This love epistle containing the wedding-ring was
most successful when it first came up, but the public
now are too wide awake. According to another informant,
the ring-dropping “lurk” is now carried
on this way, for the old style is “coopered.”
“A woman” he says, “is made up so as to
appear in the family-way&mdash;pretty far gone&mdash;and
generally with a face as long as a boy’s kite.
Up she goes to any likely ken, where she knows
there are women that are married or expect
to get married, and commences begging. Then
comes the tale of woe, if she can get them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
listen&mdash;‘I’m in the family-way,’ she says, ‘as
you can plainly see <i>young ladies</i> (this she says
to the <i>servants</i>, and that prides them you know).
My husband has left me after serving me in this
way. I don’t know where he is, and am forced to
solicit the ladies’ charity.’ Well, the servants will
bring broken victuals and make a little collection
among themselves for the ‘unprotected female;’
for which in return, with many thanks for their
kindness, she offers her gold wedding-ring for
sale, as she wants to get back to her suffering
kids to give them something to eat, poor things,
and they shall have the gold ring, she says, for
half what it’s worth; or if they won’t buy
it, will they lend 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> on it till she can
redeem it, as she hasn’t been in the habit of
pledging! The girls are taken off their guard
(she not being in the habit of pledging is a
choker for them) by the woman’s seeming simplicity,
and there’s a consultation. One says to
the other&mdash;‘Oh, you’ll want it, Mary, for John;’
and another, ‘No, you’ll want it first, Sally, for
William.’ But the woman has her eye on the one
as says the least, as the likeliest of all to want it,
and so she says to the John and William girls,
‘Oh, you don’t want it; but <i>here</i> (touching the
silent one), here’s a <i>young lady</i> as does,’ (that
sweetens the servant girl up directly.) She
says, ‘I don’t want it, bless you (with a giggle),
but I’ll lend you a trifle, as you are in this state,
and have a family, and are left like this by your
husband&mdash;aint he cruel, Sally (she adds to her fellow-servant)?’
The money the ring-woman gets, sir,
depends upon the servant’s funds; if it is just after
quarter-day, she generally gets a tidy tip&mdash;if not,
4 or 5 bob. I’ve known one woman get 10<i>s.</i> and
even 12<i>s.</i> this way. The ring is made out of brass
gilt buttons, and stunning well: it’s faked up to
rights, and takes a good judge even at this day to
detect it without a test.”</p>

<p>“The best sort of rings for <i>fawney dropping</i> is
the Belchers. They are a good thick looking
ring, and have the crown and V. R. stamped
upon them. They are 7<i>d.</i> a dozen. I takes my
stand now, in my ring-selling, as if I was in a
great hurry, and pulls out my watch. I used to
have a real one, but now it’s a dummy. ‘Now,
ladies and gentlemen,’ says I, ‘I am not permitted
to remain more than ten minutes in one spot. I
have rings to sell to decide a wager recently
made between two sporting noblemen, to the effect
that I do not sell a certain quantity of these rings
in a given time, at a penny a piece. I can recommend
the article as being well worth the money I
ask for it, perhaps something more. I do not say
they are gold; in fact, I must not say too much,
as there is a person in this company watching my
proceedings, and seeing that I do not remain more
than ten minutes in this spot,’&mdash;here I always
looks very hard at the most respectable and gentlemanly-looking
person among my hearers, and
sometimes gives him a wink, and sometimes a
nod,&mdash;‘but if you should hear anything more
about these rings, and you want to purchase,
don’t be vexed if I am gone when you want me.
The ten minutes has nearly expired; three minutes
more; any more buyers? It makes no difference
to me whether I sell or not&mdash;I get my pay all the
same; but, if you take my advice, buy; and perhaps
if you was to call at the sign of the Three
Balls, as you go home, you may be agreeably surprised,
and hear something to your advantage.
Perhaps I have said too much. I have one minute
more, before I close the establishment. After
shutting the box, I dare not sell another in this
spot, if you were to offer me 5<i>l.</i> for it; therefore,
if you wish to purchase, now is your time.’ I
make many a pitch, and do not sell a single ring;
and the insults I receive used to aggravate me very
much, but I do not mind them now, I’m used
to it. The flyest cove among all us ring-sellers is
little Ikey, the Jew. There were two used to
work the game. They had a real gold ring, just
like the ones they were selling, and they always
used to pitch near a pawnbroker’s shop. Ikey’s
pal would buy a ring for a penny, of the street-seller,
and would then say, loud enough to be heard
by the bystanders, ‘There’s a pawn shop&mdash;I’ll go
and ask them to take it in.’ A crowd would
follow him. He would enter the pawnbroker’s&mdash;present
a real gold ring&mdash;obtain a loan of 5<i>s.</i>, and
would present the ticket to the bystanders, who
would then buy very fast. When the pitch was
over, Ikey’s pal would take the ring out of pawn,
and away the two would go to work near some other
pawnbroker’s. I have heard Ikey say they have
pawned the ring thirty-five times in a day. I
tried the same caper; but my pal cut with the
gold ring the first day, and I’ve never had another
go at that <i>fake</i> since.</p>

<p>“Before I commenced the jewellery line,” continued
my candid informant, “a good many years
ago, I used to hold horses about Bond-street.
Afterwards I was taken as an errand boy at
a druggist’s, was out of an errand one day and
got 6<i>d.</i> for holding a gentleman’s horse, which
kept me nearly an hour; when I went back to
my master’s I was told I wasn’t wanted any
more. I had been cautioned about stopping of
errands two or three times before; however I
didn’t like the situation, it was too confining. I
next got a place as pot-boy, in Brick Lane. Here
I was out one day gathering in the pots. I hung
the strap of pots to a railing to have a game at
chances (pitch and toss), somebody prigged my
strap of pots, and I cut. A few weeks after I
was grabbed for this, and got a month at the mill;
but I was quite innocent of prigging&mdash;I was only
careless. When I came out of prison, I went
to Epsom races, thinking to get a job there at
something or other. A man engaged me to
assist him in ‘pitching the hunters.’ Pitching
the hunters is the three sticks a penny, with
the snuffboxes stuck upon sticks; if you throw
your stick, and they fall out of the hole, you
are entitled to what you knock off. I came
to London with my master the pitcher-hunter,
he went to a swag shop in Kent-street, in the
Borough, to purchase a new stock. I saw a man
there purchasing rings, this was little Ikey, the
Jew; some days afterwards I saw him making
a pitch, and selling very fast. I had fourpence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in my pocket; went to Kent-street, to the swag
shops, bought a dozen rings, and commenced selling
them. I sold that day three dozen; that
wasn’t bad considering that my toggery was very
queer, and I looked anything but like one who
would be trusted with ten pounds’ worth of gold
rings. This wager between the two sporting
noblemen has been a long time settling. I’ve
been at it more than fifteen years. The origin of
it was this here: when sovereigns were first
coined, the Jew boys and others used to sell
medals and card-counters upon particular occasions,
the same as they do now, and shove them in a
saucepan lid, with silver paper under them. Captain
Barclay, and another of the same sort,
bet a wager, that one of these Jew-boys could
not dispose of a certain number of real sovereigns
in a given time, supposing the Jew-boy cried
out nothing more than ‘here’s sovereigns, only
a penny a piece.’ The number he was to sell
was 50 within the hour, and to take his station
at London Bridge. The wager was made, the
Jew-boy procured, and the sovereigns put into
the pot lid. ‘Here are real sovereigns a penny
a piece, who’ll buy?’ he cried; but he sold
only a few. The number disposed of, within
the hour, I have heard, was seventeen. Those
who purchased, when they found that they had
really bought sovereigns at a penny a piece, returned
for more, but the salesman was gone. A
good harvest was afterwards reaped among the
Jews, who got up a medal something like a sovereign,
and sold them in every quarter of London,
for the Captain’s wager soon spread about everywhere.
It’s a stale game now; it was so before
my time, but I’ve heard the Jews talk about
it. The second day I tried the ring dodge, I
was a little more successful; indeed every day
for some time exceeded the day before, for, as I
improved in patter, my sales increased. My appearance,
too, was improving. At one time I was
a regular swell, sported white kid gloves, white
choker, white waistcoat, black ribbon, and a
quizzing glass. Some people used to chaff me,
and cry out ‘there’s a swell.’ I never was saving,
always spent my money as fast as I got it. I might
have saved a goodish bit, and I wish I had now.
I never had a wife, but I have had two or three
broomstick matches, though they never turned
out happy. I never got hold of one but what
was fond of lush. I live in Westminster, at a
padding-ken. I’d rather not tell you where, not
that I’ve anything to fear, but people might think
I was a <i>nose</i>, if anybody came after me, and
they would crab me. I’d rather get something
else to do if I could, but I think this is the best
street game I could follow. I don’t believe any
of the ring-sellers dispose of more than myself,
except little Ikey; he now adds other articles, a
silver thimble (he calls it), some conundrums, a
song-book and a seal, and all for a penny. I
tried the same thing, but found I could do just as
well with the rings alone. We all expects to do
great things during the Exhibition. I think all
on us ought to be allowed to sell in the parks.
Foreigners are invited to witness specimens of
British Industry, and it’s my opinion they should
see all, from the highest to the lowest. We <i>did</i>
intend petitioning the Prince on the subject, but I
don’t suppose it would be any go, seeing as how
the slang coves” (the showmen), “have done so,
and been refused.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Children’s Gilt
Watches.</span></h3>

<p>These articles were first introduced into general
street sale about 10 years ago. They were
then German made. The size was not much
larger than that of a shilling, and to this tiny
watch was appended as tiny a chain and seal.
The street-price was only 1<i>d.</i>, and the wholesale
price was 8<i>s.</i> the gross. They were sold at eight
of the swag-shops, all “English and foreign,” or
“English and German” establishments. From
the price it would appear that the profit was 4<i>d.</i>
a dozen, but as the street-sellers had to “take the
watches as they came,” the profit was but 3<i>d.</i>, as
a dozen watches in a gross had broken glasses, or
were otherwise damaged and unsaleable. The
supply of these watches was not equal to the
demand, for when a case of them was received,
“it could have been sold twice over.” One
street-seller told me that he had sold 15 and
even 16 dozen of these watches on a day, and
that once on a Saturday night, and early on
Sunday morning, he had sold 2 gross, or 24
dozen. Such, however, was not the regular sale;
a “good week” was a profit of 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>About six years ago gilt watches of a very
superior kind were sold in the streets in a different
way. They were French made, and were
at first vended at 1<i>s.</i> each. Some were displayed
in case-boxes, fitted up with divisions, in which
were placed the watches with the guard-chains,
about three-quarters of a yard long, coiled round
them. There were also two or three keys, one in
the form of a pistol. The others were hung from
a small pole, sometimes a dozen, and sometimes
two, being so suspended, and they had a good
glittering appearance in a bright light; this street
fashion still continues. The street-sellers, however,
are anxious not to expose these watches too
much, as they are easily injured by the weather,
and any stain or injury is irreparable. The shilling
sale continued prosperously for about six weeks,
and then the wholesale price&mdash;owing, the street-sellers
were told at the swag-shops, to “an opposition
in the trade in Paris,”&mdash;was reduced to
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, and the retail street-price to
6<i>d.</i> each. When the trade was “at its best”
there were thirty men and twenty women selling
these watches, all May, June, and July, and each
clearing from 12<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> (but rarely the latter
sum) a week. Last “season” there were for the
same period about half the number of sellers mentioned,
averaging a profit of about 15<i>d.</i> a day
each, or 9<i>s.</i> a week. The cry is&mdash;“Handsome
present for 6<i>d.</i> Beautiful child’s watch and
chain, made of Peruvian metal, by working
jewellers out of employ. Only 6<i>d.</i> for a handsome
present.”</p>

<p>The vendors of these watches are the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
street-sellers, some of them being tolerably good
patterers. One of these men, in the second year
of the street-sale of watches, appeared one morning
in an apron and sleeves, to which brass and
copper filings were made to adhere, and he announced
himself as an English working jeweller
unemployed, offering his own manufactures for
sale, “better finished and more solider nor the
French.” The man’s sale was greatly increased.
On the following day, however, four other English
working jewellers appeared in Leicester-square
and its approaches, each in besprinkled
apron and sleeves, and each offering the productions
of his own handicraft! The apron and
sleeves were therefore soon abandoned.</p>

<p>Among the best “pitches,”&mdash;for the watch-sellers
are not itinerant, though they walk to and fro&mdash;are
the Regent’s-park, Leicester-square, the foot
of London-bridge, and of Blackfriars-bridge, and
at the several railway stations.</p>

<p>The principal purchasers, I was told by an intelligent
patterer, who sometimes “turned his
hand to the watches,” were “fathers and mothers,”
he thought, “and them as wished to
please such parties.”</p>

<p>Calculating that twenty-five persons now vend
watches for twelve weeks in the year, and&mdash;as
they are 10 per cent. cheaper than they were at
the swag-shops&mdash;that each clears 8<i>s.</i> weekly, we
find 360<i>l.</i> yearly expended in London streets in
these toy watches.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Tinware.</span></h3>

<p>The sellers of tins, who carry them under their
arms, or in any way on a round, apart from the
use of a vehicle, are known as hand-sellers. The
word hand-seller is construed by the street-traders
as meaning literally <i>hand-seller</i>, that is to say, a
<i>seller</i> of things held or carried in the <i>hand</i>; but
the term is clearly derived from the Scotch <i>handsell</i>,
as in “handsell penny.” Handsell, according
to Jamieson, the Scotch etymologist, means, (1)
“The first money that a trader receives for goods;
also a gift conferred at a particular season. (2)
A piece of bread given before breakfast.” Ihre,
the Gothic lexicographer, views the term handsell
as having sprung from the Mæso-Gothic <i>hunsla</i>
(sacrifice or offering). This is the same as the
Anglo-Sax <i>husl</i> (the Eucharist), whence comes the
English <i>housel</i> and <i>unhouseled</i>; and he considers
the word to have originally meant a gift or offering
of any kind. Hence, the hand-sellers of tin and
other wares in the street, would mean simply those
who <i>offered</i> such tin or other wares for sale. The
goods they dispose of are dripping-pans (sometimes
called “square pans”), sold at from 3<i>d.</i> to 18<i>d.</i>,
the 3<i>d.</i> pans being “6 inch,” and the 18<i>d.</i> “15
inch;” cullenders, 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i>; hand-bowls, for
washerwomen, 1<i>s.</i> (now a very small portion of the
trade); roasting-jacks, with tin bodies, 6<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (this used to be the best article for profit
and ready sale in the trade, but “they are going
out of date”); and the smaller articles of graters,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The hand-sellers also trade in other articles
which are less portable; the principal sale, however,
is at “stands,” and there chiefly on a Saturday
night, the greatest business-time of street-commerce!
These less portable articles are tea-kettles,
10<i>d.</i> to 18<i>d.</i>; saucepans of all sizes, the smallest
being the “open pints” at 2<i>d.</i> or 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> each (they
cost them 20<i>d.</i> a dozen; it’s a bargain to get them
at 18<i>d.</i>), and the largest the “nine quart;” but
the kinds most in demand are the “three pints”
and “two quarts,” sold at 6<i>d.</i> and 8<i>d.</i> There are
also fish-kettles in this street-traffic, though to a
very limited extent&mdash;“one fish-kettle,” I was told,
“to four-and-twenty saucepans;” the selling price
for the fish-kettles is 5<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each; candlesticks
are sold at 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>; and shaving-pots, 4<i>d.</i>
A few tin things used to be sold at the mews, but
the trade is now almost entirely abandoned. These
were tins for singeing horses, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each when
first introduced, ten or twelve years ago, but now
1<i>s.</i>, and stable lanterns, of punched tin, which
cannot be sold now for more than 1<i>s.</i> each, though
they cost 10<i>s.</i> per dozen at a tin-shop.</p>

<p>There are other tin articles vended in the
streets, but they will be more properly detailed in
my account of street-artisans, as the maker and
the street-seller are the same individual. Among
these are Dutch ovens, which are rarely offered
now by those who purchase their goods at the
tin-shops, as the charge there is 6<i>d.</i> “Why,” said
a working tinman to me, “I’ve had 10<i>d.</i> many a
week for making ovens, and the stuff found. It
takes two plates of tin to make an oven, that’s
3<i>d.</i> at any tin-shop, before a minute’s labour is
given to it, and yet the men who hawk their own
goods sell their ovens regularly enough at 4<i>d.</i> It’s
the ruin of the trade.” The tin-shops, I may observe,
supply the artisans with the materials they
require, as well as the ready-made articles, to the
street-seller.</p>

<p>One of the largest street-stands “in tin” is in
St. John-street, Clerkenwell, on Saturday evenings,
but the proprietor pertains to the artisan
class, though he buys some of his goods at the
tin-shops.</p>

<p>The hand-sellers of tin are about 100 in number,
and 60 of that number may be said to be
wives and children of the remaining 40; as the
majority of the itinerant vendors of tinware are
married men with families. “Tins” are not a heavy
carriage, and can very well be borne from house to
house by women, while children sell such things
as nutmeg-graters, pepper-boxes, extinguishers,
and save-alls. Those who sell the larger tin
articles in the streets are generally the makers of
them. “A dozen years back or more, perhaps,
there was,” I was informed, “some prime block-tin
tea-pots sold in the streets; there’s none now.
Metal’s druv out tin.”</p>

<p>Among the street tin-sellers I heard many complaints
of the smallness, and the constantly diminishing
rate of their earnings. “Our people
has bad luck, too,” said one man, “or they isn’t
wide awake. You may remember, sir, that a few
weeks back, a new save-all came in, and was called
candle-wedges, and went off well. It was a tin
thing, and ought by rights to have been started by
the tin-shops for us. But it was first put out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
swag-men at 3<i>s.</i> the gross. The first and second days
the men were soon sold out. Them as could patter
tidy did the best&mdash;I tried, but you see, sir, I’m no
scholar. Well, they went at night to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;’s,
in Houndsditch, I think it is, and he says, ‘I’m
out of them, but I’ll have some in the morning.’
They goes in the morning, and the swag
says: ‘O, I can’t afford ’em at three shillings, you
can have ’em at four.’ He put 1<i>s.</i> exter on the
gross, cause they sold, nothing else, sir; and a relation
of mine heard the swag shopkeeper say,
‘Why, they’re cheap at four; Jim (the street-seller)
there made 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> on ’em yesterday. I
ain’t a going to slave, and pay rent, and rates, and
taxes, to make <i>your</i> fortens; it ain’t likely.’ You
see, sir, they was sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, and cost &frac14;<i>d.</i>,
which is 3<i>d.</i> a dozen, and so the swag got a
higher profit, while the poor fellows had to sell for
less profit.”</p>

<p>From the most reliable information which I could
acquire, it appears that these tin-sellers, taken altogether,
do not earn above 6<i>s.</i> a week each, as
regards the adult men, and half that as regards
the children and women. To realize this amount,
the adults must take 13<i>s.</i>, and the women and
children 7<i>s.</i>, for the latter are less “priced down.”
Thus, if we calculate an average receipt, per individual,
of 10<i>s.</i> weekly, reckoning 100 sellers,
we find a yearly expenditure on tins, bought in
the street, of 2500<i>l.</i> The trade is greatest in the
suburbs, and some men, who have become “known
on their rounds,” supply houses, by order, with
all the tins they require.</p>

<p>There is a branch of the tin-trade carried on in
a way which I have shown prevailed occasionally
among the costermongers, viz., the selling of goods
on commission. This system is now carried on
among all the parties who trade “from” swag-barrows.</p>

<p>The word “<i>swag</i>” which has been so often
used in this work of late, is, like many other of
the street-terms, of Scotch origin (as <i>handseller</i>,
and <i>busker</i>). The Scotch word is <i>sweg</i> or <i>swack</i>,
and means, according to Jamieson, a quantity, a
considerable number, a large collection of any kind.
(The root appears to be an ancient German term,
<i>sweig</i>&mdash;a flock, a herd.) Hence a Swag Warehouse
is a warehouse containing a large collection
of miscellaneous goods; and a Swag Barrow, a
barrow laden with a considerable assortment of
articles. The slang term <i>swag</i> means booty, plunder&mdash;that
is to say, the collection of goods&mdash;the
“lot,” the “heap” stolen.</p>

<p>Of these swag-barrowmen, there are not less than
150, and the barrows are mostly the property of
three individuals, who are not street-sellers themselves.
One of these men has 50 barrows of his
own, and employs 50 men to work them. The
barrow proprietor supplies not only the vehicle,
but the stock, and the men’s remuneration is 3<i>d.</i>
in the 1<i>s.</i> on the amount of sales. Each article
they sell is charged to the public 1<i>d.</i> The tin-wares
of the swag-barrows are nutmeg-graters,
bread-graters, beer-warmers, fish-slices, goblets,
mugs, save-alls, extinguishers, candle-shades, money-boxes,
children’s plates, and rattles. In addition
to the tin-wares, the swag-barrows are stocked
with brooches, rings, pot-ornaments, plates, small
crockeryware, toys, &amp;c., each article being also
vended at 1<i>d.</i> The trade is so far stationary, that
the men generally confine themselves to one neighbourhood,
if not to one street. The majority of
the swag-barrowmen have been costermongers,
and nearly the whole have been engaged in street
avocations all their lives. One man familiar with
the trade thought I might state that the whole
were of this description; for though there was
lately a swag-barrowman who had been a tradesman
in an extensive way, there was, he believed,
no such exception at the present time. These
barrowmen are nearly all uneducated, and are
plodding and persevering men, though they make
few exertions to better their condition. As the
barrow and stock are supplied to them, without
any outlay on their part, their faculties are not
even sharpened, as among many of the costermongers,
by the necessity of providing stock-money,
and knowing how to bargain and buy to
advantage. They have merely to sell. Their
commission furnishes little or nothing more than
the means of a bare subsistence. The great sale
is on Saturday nights at the street-markets, and
to the working people, who then crowd those
places, and, as one said to me, “has a few pennies
to lay out.” At such times as much as 3<i>l.</i> has
been taken by a swag-barrowman. During the
other days of the week their earnings are small.
It is considered a first-rate week, and there must
be all the facilities for street-trade afforded by fine
weather, to take 2<i>s.</i> a day (clearing 6<i>d.</i>), and 3<i>l.</i>
on a Saturday night. This gives the swag-barrowman
a commission of 18<i>s.</i>; but I am informed,
by competent persons, that the average of the
weekly profits of these street-traders does not
exceed 10<i>s.</i> a week. This shows a yearly receipt,
by the men working the barrows, of 3900<i>l.</i> as
their profit or payment, and a gross receipt of
11,700<i>l.</i> Of this large amount nearly two-thirds,
I am assured, is expended on tin-wares.</p>

<p>The prime cost, at the tin-shops, of these wares,
to the barrow proprietors, are 7<i>s.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
gross, leaving from 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> profit on every
shilling, over the 3<i>d.</i> commission paid to the salesman.
The tins are all made in London. The
jewellery, and other stock of the swag-barrows,
are bought at the general swag-shops, of which I
have before spoken.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of a Tin-Ware Seller.</span></h3>

<p>The following street-biography was communicated
to me in writing. It is, I believe, a striking instance
of the vicissitudes and privations to which a
street-life is subject. It forms, moreover, a curious
example of those moral contradictions which make
the same individual at one time give way <i>hopelessly</i>
to the force of circumstances, and at another
resolutely control them.</p>

<p>“My object,” says my correspondent, “for
writing this, what some folks no doubt will call
a nonsensical epistle, is merely to show how much
human nature is capable of enduring in the shape
of privations. People in easy circumstances will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
scarcely credit what I am about to relate; and
many of the poor will smile at what I have termed
hardships, and at my folly in endeavouring to
paint the misery I have endured, which will appear
slight when compared to what they themselves
have suffered.</p>

<p>“I am the son of a mechanic who was accidentally
drowned some weeks previous to my
birth. My mother, through industry and perseverance,
endeavoured to support me and my sister
till we arrived at the ages of 15 and 18,
I being the younger. I entered a gentleman’s
service as pantry-boy, where I continued until I
considered myself competent to take a higher
situation. Still a servant’s life was not the bent
of my inclinations; martial music and viewing
soldiers on parade made me think that a rifle was
a more graceful tool than a toasting-fork. I resolved
to serve his Majesty, and for that purpose
enlisted in the 60th Rifles on the route for India,
but Providence ordained it otherwise. On the
afternoon on which I ’listed I fell by accident and
broke my leg, and as I was not sworn in I was
entitled to no pension. I was six months confined
to my bed, and it was three years before I could
go without my crutch. Grief for my misfortunes
had borne my mother to an early grave, and I was
left a cripple and destitute. Whether by design
or accident I do not recollect, but I met with
the lady (Lady M&mdash;&mdash;) in whose service I
first entered as pantry-boy; she took pity on
my forlorn condition, and kindly invited me
to her Mansion, where I remained until completely
restored to health, but still crippled.
After this I was employed painting and glazing,
&amp;c., and, considering myself competent to
get my living in that line, I resolved to go to
London&mdash;the theatre of all my misery to come,
for I was disappointed. On reaching the metropolis
my paint-brush was turned into a shovel, my
paint-pot into a dust sieve, for I could only get
employed by a man to work in a dust-yard at 10<i>s.</i>
a week. From thence I went to a firm belonging
to a friend at Beckenham, near Croydon, as working
time-keeper, or foreman; but during a fair in
that village I neglected to back the time, and being
discharged was cast upon the world again with
only 3<i>s.</i> in my pocket, which I eat and drank up,
having no idea of street trading. Then came my
trials; but having had sufficient food during the
day, I did not feel much the effects of my first
night in the streets. The next day I had no food,
and towards dusk began bitterly to feel my situation;
that night I slept, or rather lay, in an empty
house. Towards noon of the next day I felt weak,
and drank large quantities of water, for I had no
particular desire for food. Passing by a shop
where old clothes were offered for sale, I saw a
man wretched in appearance disposing of an old
vest for a few pence. I caught the malady and
was instantly spoiled of my coat, having received
in exchange for it 2<i>s.</i> and an old frock&mdash;such as
are generally worn by waggoners or countrymen.
I more than once smiled at my novel appearance.
A penny loaf, a drink of water, and a
threepenny lodging was the first assault upon my
2<i>s.</i> I regretted, however, the 3<i>d.</i> paid for my
lodging, and determined not to risk another, for
my bedfellows were so numerous, and of such
teazing propensities, that they would not allow me
to sleep; truly indeed is it said that ‘poverty
makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows.’ At
this time I formed an acquaintance with a man
whose condition was similar to my own; he engaged
to put me ‘fly to a dodge’ or two; an
explanation from him was necessary to make me
acquainted with the sense of his words, which I
soon found simply meant artful manœuvres. One
of these dodges was to snooze (a term for sleeping)
in the Adelphi arches; I felt grateful for such a
mark of disinterested friendship, and next day my
friend and me fared sumptuously on the produce
of my coat, and at night we repaired to the Arches
in question, and there found a comfortable lodging
in a hay-loft. I lay for some time, but did
not sleep. I was several times addressed by my
companion in an under tone, ‘Are you asleep,’
he whispered, ‘ain’t it a stunning dos?’ (which
means a good bed). I was not in a mood for
conversation, and made no reply; to silence him
completely I affected to snore, and this had the
desired effect. For a few minutes he was quite
quiet, and then he commenced with great caution
to unlace my boots, with a view to stealing them.
I perceived his object, and immediately left my
lodging and companion. I felt grieved and disappointed
at the loss of one in whom I placed all
confidence; but this time wisdom was purchased
cheaply, inasmuch as I suffered no loss except that
my money might have lasted me a little longer.
The remainder of that night I strayed about the
Strand and Charing-cross, after a drink of water;
I took a seat on a curb surrounding the pump;
many wretched beings came and seated themselves
beside me, and a conversation ensued respecting
their several destinations during the day. One
proposed going to Hungerford-market to do a
feed on decayed shrimps or other offal laying
about the market; another proposed going to
Covent-garden to do a ‘tightener’ of rotten
oranges, to which I was humorously invited; I
accepted the invitation, and proceeded with my
new companion. I fared well; I filled my hat,
took a seat, and made a most delicious breakfast.
I remained strolling about the Garden all day, and
towards evening was invited by my companions to
a ‘dos’ in an open shed in Islington; this I
declined, alleging that I had a lodging, but that
night I slept amongst a heap of stones near the
pillar at Charing-cross. I continued to attend
the Garden for several weeks, subsisting entirely
on the offal of that market. One day I took
notice of a man there selling chestnut leaves; I
enquired how he obtained them: he told me he
plucked them from the trees without hindrance,
and directed me to where I could obtain some. I
went to a grove in the vicinity of Kilburn, and lay
there all night. Next morning I found no leaves,
so I returned disappointed to town, and on going
through the market a woman employed me to
carry a bushel of pears some little distance for her
for a penny. I felt quite elevated in anticipation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
such a treat as a penny loaf, but alas! I fell down
under the weight of the fruit and poverty; my
employer, however, kindly gave me the penny,
though some of her pears were injured, and I had
not taken them half the required distance. With
the money I purchased a loaf, and sat on a stone
near the pump in Covent Garden and began my
meal. Here I soon had a companion, who after
rincing a lettuce at the pump, began to devour it.
I shared my loaf with him. ‘O God!’ said he,
‘what are we destined to suffer. I have escaped
the bullets of the Carlists in Spain to die in the
streets of London with hunger.’ I felt an interest
in the poor fellow, who I discovered in the course
of conversation had been a gentleman’s servant in
his time; he assured me he had been living in the
same way for several weeks as I myself had been.
Towards night my companion asked me where I
slept. I told him my different haunts, he told me
I’d better go to the straw-yard with him; this was
a place I had not yet heard of; it was the nightly
refuge for the houseless poor. I accompanied him
without hesitation; my confidence was not misplaced;
I slept there several nights. Bread was
distributed to us night and morning, and this was
fortunate, for the Garden began to fail. In the
course of conversation with some of the inmates of
the Refuge, we found that we could obtain employment
at stone-breaking; this we tried the next
morning, and succeeded. We worked all day, and
received 6<i>d.</i> each on leaving work. We then
made up our minds to go to lodgings that we might
have an opportunity of washing what were once
shirts.</p>

<p>“Misery had not had that wasting influence on
my companion as it had on me. I was at this
time a complete skeleton; a puff of wind would
cause me to stagger. I continued stone-breaking,
but about noon of the third day I sunk exhausted
on the heap of stones before me. Poverty had done
its work, and I anticipated with pleasure approaching
dissolution. I was assisted to my lodging by my
companion, and went to bed. When the woman at
the lodging-house discovered that I was ill, she ordered
some of her domestics to dress me and put
me in the street, alleging that she was under a
penalty of 20<i>l.</i> were it discovered that she lodged
a sick stranger. I was, therefore, cast into the
street at 12 o’clock at night. My companion then
gave me the 3<i>d.</i> he had earned that day to procure
me a lodging if possible, and he slept in the
streets the remainder of the night. I went to
another lodging, concealing as much as possible
my illness; my money was taken, and I was conducted
to bed. I spent a wretched night, and
next morning I was very bad. The landlady
led me to the workhouse; I was admitted
directly; had they detained me asking questions
I should have sunk on the floor. My disorder
was pronounced English cholera. I lay three
weeks in a precarious state, but at the end of
seven weeks was recovered sufficiently to walk
about. I was then discharged; but on going
towards the Abbey in Westminster I fainted, and
on recovery found myself surrounded by a number
of persons. I was advised to return to the
house; I did so, and was admitted for a short time,
after which I was again discharged, but I received
out-door relief twice a week; and for some time a
small portion of bread and cheese as well. <i>I had
now lost not only all hope, but even desire of
bettering my condition</i>; during these trials I
made none acquainted with my privations, save
those situated as I was. I now altered my condition
as regards sleeping; I walked about during
the night, and slept a portion of the day on a heap
of sand near Westminster-bridge. I then remembered
to have a poor relative in Kensington; I did
not plead distress, but merely asked whether she
knew where I might procure employment. I had
a cup of tea, the first I had tasted since I was in
the workhouse, a period of five weeks. Being
asked some question by my relative, I could not
help making reference to some of my sufferings.
At this place I found a young man of whom I
had had a previous acquaintance; I told him of my
inability to procure a lodging, and he allowed
me without the knowledge of his parents to sleep
in the stable-loft; the bed was hard, but the coal
sacks kept me warm. Here I had many opportunities
of earning a few pence, and I began to
regain my spirits. On one occasion, seeing a lad
illtreated by a young man who was much his
superior in size and strength, I interposed, and it
may be conjectured in what manner. This circumstance
procured me a friend, for, with the assistance
of the lad I had protected, I was enabled to
live tolerably well, and after a short while I got a
situation at a coal-shed at 10<i>s.</i> a week. I continued
in this place eighteen months, but, my
master giving up the business, I was again cast
on the world. I then began to think seriously of
some way of living, and for the first time asked
for the loan of 15<i>s.</i> With this I purchased a
few articles of furniture, laid out 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for two
hundred of oranges, with which I walked and
hawked about two days, taking but 4<i>d.</i> during the
time. I disposed of the remainder of my stock,
wholesale, for 6<i>s.</i>; with this I purchased a small
tin saucepan, a piece of marble slab, and commenced
sugar-boiling. I retailed my manufacture
in the streets. By dint of perseverance and
economy I managed to live this way through the
winter and a portion of the spring; but summer
being now come, people needed none of my compounds
to warm their mouths, so it was necessary
for me to change my hand. What should I do?
Thoughts came and vanished at their births. I
recollected having seen a person selling rings at
a penny each; I made up my mind to try the
same. I laid out 5<i>s.</i> in a tray and stock; after
arranging the goods to the best advantage I sallied
into the streets. The glittering baubles took
for a while, but when discoloured were useless.
Having once a considerable stock of these soiled
rings, I was prompted to begin “lot selling.”
After calculating the profits, I commenced selling
in that line. As this continued for seven weeks
I managed to get a living. The system then
became general; every street in the metropolis
contained a lot seller, so I was determined to
change my hand. One day in the street I saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
girl with a bundle of old umbrellas going towards
a marine store shop; I asked if the umbrellas
were for sale; she replied in the affirmative; the
price she asked was 4<i>d.</i>; I became a purchaser.
With these old umbrellas I commenced a new life.
I bought some trifling tools necessary for repairing
umbrellas, and, after viewing well the construction
of the articles, I commenced operations. I succeeded,
and in a little time could not only mend an old
umbrella, but make a new one. This way of living
I followed three years. In one of my walks
through the streets crying old umbrellas to sell,
I saw a street tinker repairing a saucepan; he
seemed so very comfortable with his fire-pan before
him, that I resolved from that moment to become
a tinker, and for that purpose I bought a few
tools, prepared a budget, and sallied into the
streets with as much indifference as if I had been
at the business since my birth. After a little
practice I fancied I was fit for better things than
mending old saucepans, and flattered myself that I
was able to make a new one. This I resolved to
attempt, and succeeded so well, that I at once
abandoned the rainy-day system, and commenced
manufacturing articles in tin-ware, such as are now
sold in the streets, namely funnels, nutmeg-graters,
penny mugs, extinguishers, slices, savealls, &amp;c. I
soon became known to the street-sellers and swag-shop
proprietors. The prices I get are low, and
I am deficient in some of the tools necessary to
forward the work, with the required speed to
procure returns adequate to my expenses; but
thanks to the Lord I am better off than ever I
expected to be, with the difference only of a
somewhat shattered constitution. There are many
at the present day suffering as I have done, and
they may be found in and about the different
markets of the metropolis.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Dog-Collars.</span></h3>

<p>Of these street-traders there are now regularly
twelve; one man counted to me fourteen, but two
of these only sold dog-collars occasionally, when
they could not get employment in their trade as
journeymen brass-founders. Of the regular hands,
one, two, and sometimes three sell only dog-collars
(with the usual adjuncts of locks, and sometimes
chains, and key-rings), but even these, when their
stock-money avails, prefer uniting to the collars
some other trifling article.</p>

<p>Two of the most profitable pitches for the sale
of these articles are in the neighbourhood of the
Old Swan Pier, off Thames-street, and at a corner
of the Bank. Neither of these two traders confines
his stock to dog-collars, though they constitute
the most valuable portion of it. The one
sells, in addition to his collars, key-rings, keys
and chains, dog-whistles, stamps with letters engraved
upon them, printer’s type, in which any
name or initials may be set up, shaving-brushes,
trowser-straps, razors, and a few other light articles.
The other sells little more than “dog”
articles, with the addition of brass padlocks and
small whips. But the minor commodities are
frequently varied, according to the season and
to the street-seller’s opinion of what may “sell.”</p>

<p>Some of these traders hang their wares against
the rails of any public or other building in a good
situation, where they can obtain leave. Others
have stalls, with “a back,” from the corners of
which hang the strings of dog-collars, one linked
within another. The manner in which one street-seller
displays his wares is shown in the illustration
before given. Of the whole number, half are
either itinerant on a round, or walk up and down
a thoroughfare and an adjacent street or two.
“Dog-collars,” said one man, “is no good at
Saturday-night markets. People has said to me&mdash;for
I was flat enough to try once&mdash;‘Dogs! pooh,
I’ve hardly grub enough for the kids.’ For all
that, sir, some poor people has dogs, and is very
fond of them too; ay, and I’ve sold them collars,
but seldom. I think it’s them as has no children
has dogs.”</p>

<p>The collars most in demand are brass. One man
pointed out to me the merits of his stock, which
he retailed from 6<i>d.</i> each (for the very small
ones) to 3<i>s.</i>&mdash;for collars seemingly big enough for
Pyrenean sheep dogs. Some of the street-sold
collars have black and red rims and linings;
others are of leather, often scarlet, stitched ornamentally
over a sort of jointed iron or wire-work.
A few are of strong compact steel chain-work;
“but them’s more the fashion,” said one seller,
“for sporting dogs, like pointers and greyhounds,
and is very seldom bought in the streets. It’s
the pet dogs as is our best friends.”</p>

<p>The dog-collar sellers have, as regards perhaps
one-half, been connected in their youth with some
mechanical occupation in metal manufacture. Four,
I am told, are or were pensioners to a small amount,
as soldiers or sailors.</p>

<p>Some further particulars of the business will be
found in the following statement given me by a
man in the trade. He was sickly-looking, seemed
dispirited at first, but to recover his spirits as he
conversed, and spoke with a provincial (I presume
a Warwickshire or Staffordshire) accent.</p>

<p>“I served my time, sir; my relations put me&mdash;for
my parents died when I was a boy&mdash;to a
harness furniture maker, in Wa’sall (Walsal), who
supplied Mr. Dixon, a saddler’s ironmonger, in a
good way. I had fair makings, and was well
treated, and when I was out of my time I worked
for another master, and I then found I could make
my pad territs” (the round loops of the harness
pad, through which the reins are passed), “my
hooks, my buckles, my ornaments (some of ’em
crests), as well as any man. I worked only in
brass, never plated, but sometimes the body for
plating, and mostly territs and hooks. Thinking
I’d better myself, I came to London. I was
between five and six weeks before I got a stroke
of work, and my money had gone. I found that
London harness makers and coachmakers’ names
was put on Walsal-made goods, and ‘London made’
and ‘town made’ was put too. They might be as
good, but they wasn’t town made no more nor I am.
I can’t tell what I suffered, and felt, and thought,
as at last I walked the streets. I was afraid to
call at any brass-worker’s&mdash;for I can do many sorts
of brass work&mdash;I was so shabby. I called once at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;’s, near Smithfield, and he, or his foreman
perhaps it was, says to me, ‘Give that tug-buckle
a file.’ I’d had nothing to eat but an
apple I found in the street that day, and my hand
trembled, and so he told me that drunkards,
with trembling hands, wouldn’t do there. I was
never a drinking man; and at that time hadn’t
tasted so much as beer for ten days. My
landlady&mdash;I paid her 1<i>s.</i> a week for half a
bed with a porter&mdash;trusted me my rent, ’cause
I paid her when I had it; but I walked about,
narvussed and trembling, and frightened at every
sudden sound. No, sir, I’ve stood looking over
a bridge, but, though I may have thought of
suicide, I never once had really a notion of it. I
don’t know how to tell it, but I felt stupified
like, as much as miserable. <i>I felt I could do nothing.</i>
Perhaps I shouldn’t have had power of
mind to drown myself if I’d made up my resolution;
besides, it’s a dreadful wickedness. I
always liked reading, and, before I was fairly
beaten out, used to read at home, at shop-windows,
and at book-stalls, as long as I dared, but
latterly, when I was starving, I couldn’t fix my
mind to read anyhow. One night I met a Wa’s’ll
friend, and he took me to his inn, and gave me a
good beef-steak supper and some beer, and he got
me a nice clean bed in the house. In the morning
he gave me what did me most good of all, a
good new shirt, and 5<i>s.</i> I got work two days
after, and kept it near five years, with four masters,
and married and saved 12<i>l.</i> We had no
family to live, and my poor wife died in the
cholera in 1849, and I buried her decently, thank
God, for she was a good soul. When I thought
the cholera was gone, I had it myself, and was ill
long, and lost my work, and had the same sufferings
as before, and was without soles to my shoes
or a shirt to my back, ’till a gentleman I’d worked
for lent me 1<i>l.</i>, and then I went into this trade,
and pulled up a little. In six weeks I paid 15<i>s.</i>
of my debt, and had my own time for the remaining
5<i>s.</i> Now I get an odd job with my master
sometimes, and at others sell my collars, and
chains, and key-rings, and locks, and such like.
I’m ashamed of the dog-collar locks; I can buy
them at 2<i>d.</i> a dozen, or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a gross; they’re
sad rubbish. In two or three weeks sometimes,
the wire hasp is worn through, just by the rattling
of the collar, and the lock falls off. I make now,
one way and another, about 10<i>s.</i> a week. My
lodging’s 2<i>s.</i> a week for a bed-room&mdash;it’s a closet
tho’, for my furniture all went. God’s good, and
I’ll see better days yet. I have sure promise of
regular work, and then I can earn 30<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i>
I do best with my collars about the docks. I’m
sure I don’t know why.”</p>

<p>I am told that each of the street-sellers of dog-collars
sell on the average a dozen a week, at a
medium receipt of 12<i>s.</i> (“sometimes 20<i>s.</i>, and
sometimes 6<i>s.</i>”), though some will sell three and
even four dozen collars in the week. Any regular
dog-collar seller will undertake to get a name engraved
upon it at 1<i>d.</i> a letter. The goods are bought
at a swag-shop, or an establishment carried on in
the same way. The retailer’s profit is 35 per cent.</p>

<p>Reckoning 12<i>s.</i> weekly taken by twelve men,
we find 374<i>l.</i> expended yearly in the streets in
dog-collars.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of a Street-Seller of Dog-Collars.</span></h3>

<p>From the well-known vendor of these articles
whose portrait was given in No. 10 of this work,
I had the following sketch of his <span class="lock">history:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was born in Brewer-street, St. James,” he
said, in answer to my questions; “I am 73 years
of age. My father and mother were poor people;
I never went to school; my father died while I
was young; my mother used to go out charing;
she couldn’t afford to pay for schooling, and told
me, I must look out and <i>yearn</i> my own living
while I was a mere chick. At ten years of age
I went to sea in the merchant sarvice. While
I was in the merchant sarvice, I could get
good wages, for I soon knowed my duty. I was
always of an industrious turn, and never liked to
be idle; don’t you see what I mean. In ’97
I was pressed on board the <span class="smcap">Inconstant</span> frigate;
I was paid off six months arterwards, but hadn’t
much to take, and that, like all other young men
who hadn’t larned the dodges of life, I spent very
soon; but I never got drunk&mdash;thank God!” said
the old man, “I never got drunk, or I shouldn’t
ha been what I am now at 73 years of age. I was
drafted into the Woolwich 44-gun ship; from her to
the <span class="smcap">Overisal</span>.” I inquired how the name of the
ship was spelt; “Oh I am not scholard enough for
that there,” he replied, “tho’ I did larn to read
and write when abord a man of war. I larned myself.
But you must look into a <i>Dutch dictionary</i>,
for it’s a Dutch name. I then entered on board
the <span class="smcap">Amphine</span> frigate, and arter I had sarved some
months in her, I entered the merchant sarvice
again, and arter that I went to Greenland to the
whale-fishery&mdash;they calls me here in the college”
(he is now an inmate of Greenwich Hospital)
“‘<i>Whaler Ben</i>,’ but I arnt affronted&mdash;most on ’em
here have nicknames. I went three voyages
besides to the West Ingees. I never got drunk
even there, though I was obliged to drink rum;
it wouldn’t ha done to ha drunk the water <span class="smcap lowercase">NEAT</span>,
there was so many insects in it. When my sailor’s
life was over I comes to Liverpool and marries a
wife&mdash;aye and as good a wife as any poor man
ever had in England. I had saved a goodish bit
o’ money, nearly 300<i>l.</i>, for I was not so foolish as
some of the poor sailors, who yearns their money
like horses and spends it like asses, I say. Well
we sets up a shop&mdash;a chandler shop&mdash;in Liverpool:
me and my old ’ooman does; and I also entered
into the pig-dealing line. I used to get some of
my pigs from Ireland, and some I used to breed
myself, but I was very misfortunate. You recollect
the year when the disease was among the
cattle, in course you recollects that; well, sir, I lost
24 pigs and a horse in one year, and that
was a good loss for a poor man, wer’n’t it? I
thought it werry hard, for I’d worked hard for
my money at sea, and I was always werry careful,
arter I knowed what life was. My poor wife too
used to trust a good deal in the shop and by-and-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>by,
behold you, me and my old ’ooman was on our
beam ends. My wife was took ill too&mdash;and, for
the purpose of getting the best adwice, I brings
her to London, but her cable had run out, and she
died, and I’ve been a poor forlorned creatur’ ever
since. You wouldn’t think it, but arter that I never
slept on a bed for seven years. I had blankets
and my clothes&mdash;but what I means is that I never
had a bed to lie on. I sold most of my bits o’
things to bury my wife. I didn’t relish applying
to the parish. I kept a few sticks tho’, for I don’t
like them ere lodging-houses. I can’t be a werry
bad kerackter, for I was seven years under one
landlord, and I warrant me if I wanted a room
agin he would let me have one. Arter my wife
died, knowing some’at about ropes I gets work at
Maberley’s, the great contractors&mdash;in course you
knows <i>him</i>. I made rope traces for the artillery;
there’s a good deal of leather-work about the traces,
and stitching them, you see, puts me up to the
making of dogs’-collars. I was always handy with
my fingers, and can make shoes or anythink. I
can work now as well as ever I could in my life,
only my eyes isn’t so good. Ain’t it curious now,
sir, that wot a man larns in his fingers he never
forgets? Well being out o’ work, I was knocking
about for some time, and then I was adwised to
apply for a board to carry at one of them cheap
tailors, but I didn’t get none; so I takes to hawking
link buttons and key rings, and buys some
brass dog-collars; it was them brass collars as
made me bethought myself as I could make some
leather ones. Altho’ I had been better off I
didn’t think it any disgrace to get a honest living.
The leather collars is harder to make than the brass
ones, only the brass ones wants more implements.
There are about a dozen selling in the streets
as makes brass-collars&mdash;there’s not much profit on
the brass ones. People says there’s nothing
like leather, and I thinks they are right. Well,
sir, as I was a telling you, I commences the
leather-collar making,&mdash;in course I didn’t make
’em as well at first as I do now. It was werry
hard lines at the best of times. I used to get
up at 4 o’clock in the morning in the summer
time, and make my collars; then I’d turn out
about 9, and keep out until 7 or 8 at night. I
seldom took more than 2<i>s.</i> per day. What profit
did I get out of 2<i>s.</i>? Why, lor’ bless you, sir!
if I hadn’t made them myself, I shouldn’t have
got no profit at all. But as it was, if I took 2<i>s.</i>,
the profits was from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; howsomever,
sometimes I didn’t take 6<i>d.</i> Wet days too used
to run me aground altogether; my rheumatics
used to bore me always when the rain come down,
and then I couldn’t get out to sell. If I’d any
leather at them times I used to make it up; but
if I hadn’t none, why I was obligated to make
the best on it. Oh, sir! you little knows what
I’ve suffered; many a banyan day I’ve had in
my little room&mdash;upon a wet day&mdash;aye, and other
days too. Why, I think I’d a starved if it
hadn’t a been for the ’bus-men about Hungerford-market.
They are good lads them there ’bus
lads to such as me; they used to buy my collars
when they didn’t want them. Ask any on ’em
if they know anything about old Tom, the collar-maker,
and see if they don’t flare up and respect
me. They used sometimes to raffle my collars
and give ’em back to me. Mr. Longstaff too,
the landlord of the Hungerford Arms&mdash;I believe
it’s called the Hungerford Hotel&mdash;has given me
something to eat very often when I was hungry,
and had nothing myself. There’s what you call
a hor’nary there every day. You knows what I
mean&mdash;gentlemen has their grub there at so much a
head, or so much a belly it should be, I says. I
used to come in for the scraps, and werry thankful
I was for them I can assure you. Yes, Mr.
Longstaff is what you may call a good man. He’s
what you calls a odd man, and a odd man’s
always a good man. All I got to say is, ‘God
bless him!’ he’s fed me many time when I’ve
been hungry. I used to light upon other friends
too,&mdash;landlords of public-houses, where I used to
hawk my collars; they seemed to take to me somehow;
it wer’n’t for what I spent in their houses
I’m sure, seeing as how I’d nothing to spend. I
had no pension for my sarvice, and so I was
adwised to apply for admission to ‘the house here’
(Greenwich Hospital). I goes to Somerset-House;
another poor fellow was making a application at
the same time; but I didn’t nothing till one
very cold day, when I was standing quite miserable
like with my collars. I’d been out several
hours and hadn’t taken a penny, when up comes
the man as wanted to get into the house, running
with all his might to me. I thought he was going
to tell me he had got into the house, and I was
glad on it, for, poor fellow, he was werry bad off;
howsomever he says to me, ‘Tom,’ says he, ‘they
wants you at the Admirality.’ ‘Does they?’
says I, and ’cordingly away I goes; and arter
telling the admiral my sarvice, and answering a
good many questions as he put to me, the admiral
says, says he, ‘The order will be made out; you
shall go into the house.’ I think the admiral
knowed me or somethink about me, you see. I
don’t know his name, and it would’nt ha’ done to
have axed. God bless him, whoever he is, I says,
and shall say to my dying day; it seemed like
Providence. I hadn’t taken a ha’penny all that
day; I was cold and hungry, and suffering great
pain from my rheumatics. Thank God,” exclaimed
the old man in conclusion, “I am quite
comfortable now. I’ve everythink I want except
a little more tea and shuggar, but I’m quite content,
and thank God for all his mercies.”</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>The old man informed me moreover that he did
not think there were more than half-a-dozen street-sellers
besides himself who made leather collars;
it was a poor trade, he said, and though the other
makers were younger than he was, he “could lick
them all at stitching.” He did not believe, he
told me, that any of the collar-sellers sold more
than he did&mdash;if as many&mdash;for he had friends that
perhaps other men had not. He makes collars
now sometimes, and wishes he could get some
shopkeeper to sell them for him, and then maybe,
he says, he could obtain a little more tea and
shuggar, and assist a sister-in-law of his whom he
tells me is in great distress, and whom he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
in the habit of assisting for many years, notwithstanding
his poverty. The old man, during the
recital of his troubles, was affected to tears
several times&mdash;especially when he spoke of his
wife, and the distress he had undergone&mdash;and
with much sincerity blessed God for the comforts
that he now enjoys.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Tools.</span></h3>

<p>These people are of the same class as the sellers
of hardware articles, though so far a distinct body
that they generally sell tools only.</p>

<p>The tools are of the commonest kind, and supplied
by the cheapest swag-shops, from which establishments
the majority of the street-traders
derive their supplies. They are sometimes displayed
on a small barrow, sometimes on a stall,
and are mostly German-made.</p>

<p>The articles sold and the price asked&mdash;and
generally obtained, as no extravagant profit is demanded&mdash;is
shown by the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Claw hammers, 6<i>d.</i> Large claw, black and
glaze-faced, 1<i>s.</i> Pincers, 4<i>d.</i>; larger ones, 6<i>d.</i>
Screw-drivers, from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>! Flat-nose pliers,
6<i>d.</i> a pair; squares, 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> Carpenters’ oil-cans,
from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> Nests of brad-awls (for
joiners, and in wooden cases), 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> Back
saws, 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>While many of the street-sellers of tools travel
the several thoroughfares and suburbs of
the metropolis, others vend tools of a particular
kind in particular localities. These localities and
sellers may be divided into four distinct classes:&mdash;(1)
The street-sellers of tools in the markets; (2)
The street-sellers of tools at the docks and warehouses;
(3) The street-sellers of tools at mews,
stable-yards, and job-masters’; and (4) The street-sellers
of tools to working men at their workshops.</p>

<p>The markets which are usually frequented by
the vendors of tools are Newgate and Leadenhall.
There are, I am informed, only five or six street-sellers
who at present frequent these markets on
the busy days. The articles in which they deal
are butchers’ saws, cleavers, steels, meat-hooks,
and knives; these saws they sell from 2<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>
each; knives and steels, from 9<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each;
cleavers, from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> each; and meat-hooks
at 1<i>d.</i>, 2<i>d.</i>, and 3<i>d.</i> each, according to the size.
It is very seldom, however, that cleavers are sold
by the street-sellers, as they are too heavy to
carry about. I am told that the trade of the
tool-sellers in Newgate and Leadenhall markets is
now very indifferent, owing chiefly to the butchers
having been so frequently imposed upon by the
street-sellers, that they are either indisposed or
afraid to deal with them. When the itinerant
tool-sellers are not occupied at the markets they
vend their wares to tradesmen at private shops,
but often without success. “It is a poor living,”
said one of the hawkers to me; “sometimes little
better than starving. I have gone out a whole
day and haven’t taken a farthing.” I am informed
that the greater portion of these street-sellers are
broken-down butchers. The tools they vend are
purchased at the Brummagem warehouses. To
start in this branch of the street-business 5<i>s.</i> or
10<i>s.</i> usually constitutes the amount of capital invested
in stock, and the average takings of each
are about 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p>“A dozen years back twenty such men offered
saws at my shop,” said a butcher in a northern
suburb to me; “now there’s only one, and he
seems half-starving, poor fellow, and looks very
hungrily at the meat. Perhaps it’s a way he’s
got to have a bit given him, as it is sometimes.”</p>

<p>The only street-seller of tools at present frequenting
Billingsgate-market is an elderly man,
who is by trade a working cutler. The articles
he displays upon his tray are oyster-knives, fish-knives,
steels, scissors, packing-needles, and hammers.
This tradesman makes his own oyster-knives
and fish-knives; the scissors and hammers
are second-hand; and the packing-needles are
bought at the ironmongers. Sometimes brad-awls,
gimlets, nails, and screws form a part of his
stock. He informed me that he had frequented
Billingsgate-market upwards of ten years. “Wet
or dry,” he said, “I am here, and I often suffer
from rheumatics in the head and limbs. Sometimes
I have taken only a few pence; on other
occasions I have taken 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i>, but this is not
very often. However, what with the little I take
at Billingsgate, and at other places, I can just get
a crust, and go on from day to day.”</p>

<p>The itinerant saw-sellers offer their goods to any
one in the street as well as at the shops, and are
at the street markets on Saturday evenings with
small saws for use in cookery. With the butchers
they generally barter rather than sell, taking any
old saw in exchange with so much money, for a
new one. “I was brought up a butcher,” said
one of these saw-sellers, “and worked as a journeyman,
off and on, between twenty and thirty year.
But I grew werry delicate from rheumaticks, and
my old ’ooman was bad too, so that we once had
to go into Marylebone work’us. I had no family
living, perhaps they’re better as it is. We discharged
ourselves after a time, and they gave
us 5<i>s.</i> I then thought I’d try and sell a few saws
and things. A master-butcher that’s been a
friend to me, lent me another 5<i>s.</i>, and I asked a
man as sold saws to butchers to put me in the
way of it, and he took me to a swag-shop.
I do werry badly, sir, but I’ll not deny, and I
can’t deny&mdash;not anyhow&mdash;when you tell me
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; told you about me&mdash;that there’s ’elps
to me. If I make a bargain, for so much; or for
old saws or cleavers, or any old butcher thing, and
so much; a man wot knows me says, ‘Well, old
boy, you don’t look satisfied; here’s a bit of steak
for you.’ Sometimes it’s a cut off a scrag of
mutton, or weal; that gives the old ’ooman
and me a good nourishing bit of grub. I can
work at times, and every Saturday a’most I’m
now a porter to a butcher. I carries his meat
from Newgate, when he’s killed hisself, and
wants no more than a man’s weight from the
market; and when he ’asn’t killed hisself in
course he hires a cart. I makes 1<i>s.</i> a day the
year round, I think, on saws, and my old ’ooman
makes more than ’arf as much at charing, and
there’s the ’elps, and then I gets 18<i>d.</i> and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
grub every Saturday. It’s no use grumbling;
lots isn’t grubbed ’arf so well as me and my old
’ooman. My rent’s 20<i>d.</i> a week.”</p>

<p>The articles vended by the second class of the
street-sellers of tools, or those whose purchasers
are mostly connected with the docks and warehouses,
consist of iron-handled claw-hammers,
spanners, bed-keys, and corkscrews. Of these
street-traders there are ten or twelve, and the
greater portion of them are blacksmiths out of
employ. Some make their own hammers, whereas
others purchase the articles they vend at the
swag-shops. “We sell more hammers and bed-keys
than other things,” said one, “and sometimes
we sells a corkscrew to the landlord of a
public-house, and then we have perhaps half-a-pint
of beer. Our principal customers for spanners
are wheelwrights. Those for hammers are
egg-merchants, oilmen, wax and tallow-chandlers,
and other tradesmen who receive or send out
goods in wooden cases; as well as chance customers
in the streets.” The amount of capital
required to start in the line is from 5<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>: “it
is not much use,” said one, “to go to shop with
less than 10<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>A third class of the street-sellers of tools are
the vendors of curry-combs and brushes, mane-combs,
scrapers, and clipping instruments; and
these articles are usually sold at the several mews,
stable-yards, and jobbing-masters’ in and about the
metropolis. The sellers are mostly broken-down
grooms, who, not being able to obtain a situation,
resort to street-selling as a last shift. “It is the
last coach, when a man takes to this kind of
living,” said one of my informants, a groom in a
“good place;” “and it’s getting worse and worse.
The poor fellows look half-starved. Why, what
do you think I gave for these scissors? I got ’em
for 6<i>d.</i> and a pint of beer, and I should have to
give perhaps half-a-crown for ’em at a shop.” The
trade is fast declining, and to gentlemen’s carriage
mews the street-sellers of such tools rarely resort,
as the instruments required for stable-use are now
bought, by the coachmen, of the tradesmen who
supply their masters. At the “mixed mews,” as
I heard them called, there are two men who, along
with razors, knives, and other things, occasionally
offer “clipping” and “trimming” scissors. Four
or five years ago there were four of these street-sellers.
The trimming-scissors are, in the shops,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pair. There is one trade still
carried on in these places, although it is diminutive
compared to what it was: I allude to the sale of
curry-combs. Those vended by street-sellers at the
mews are sold at 7<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> The best sale for these
curry-combs is about Coventry-street and the Haymarket,
and at the livery-stables generally. Along
with curry-combs, the street-vendors sell wash-leathers,
mane-combs (horn), sponges (which were
like dried moss for awhile, I was told, got up by
the Jews, but which are now good), dandy-brushes
(whalebone-brushes, to scrape dirt from a horse’s
legs, before he is groomed), spoke-brushes (to clean
carriage-wheels), and coach-mops. One dweller in
a large West-end mews computed that 100 different
street-traders resorted thither daily, and that
twenty sold the articles I have specified. In this
trade, I am assured, there are no broken-down
coachmen or grooms, only the regular street-sellers.
A commoner curry-comb is sold at 2<i>d.</i> (prime cost
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a dozen), at Smithfield, on market-days,
and to the carmen, and the owners of the rougher
sort of horses; but this trade is not extensive.</p>

<p>There may be ten men, I am told, selling common
“currys;” and they also sell other articles
(often horse oil-cloths and nose-bags) along with
them.</p>

<p>The last class of street-sellers is the beaten-out
mechanic or workman, who, through blindness, age,
or infirmities, is driven to obtain a livelihood by
supplying his particular craft with their various
implements. Of this class, as I have before stated,
there are six men in London who were brought up
as tailors, but are now, through some affliction or
privation, incapacitated from following their calling.
These men sell needles at four and five for 1<i>d.</i>;
thimbles 1<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i> each; scissors from 1<i>s.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and wax 1<i>d.</i> the lump. There are also
old and blind shoemakers, who sell a few articles
of grindery to their shopmates, as they term them,
as well as a few decayed members of other trades,
hawking the implements of the handicraft to
which they formerly belonged. But as I have
already given a long account of one of this class,
under the head of the blind needle-seller, there is
no occasion for me to speak further on the subject.</p>

<p>From one of the street-traders in saws I had the
following account of his struggles, as well as the
benefit he received from teetotalism, of which he
spoke very warmly. His room was on the fourth
floor of a house in a court near Holborn, and was
clean and comfortable-looking. There were good-sized
pictures, in frames, of the Queen, the Last Supper,
and a Rural Scene, besides minor pictures:
some of these had been received in exchange for
saws with street-picture-sellers. A shelf was
covered with china ornaments, such as are sold in
the streets; the table had its oil-skin cover, and
altogether I have seldom seen a more decent room.
The rent, unfurnished, was 2<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>“I’ve been eight years in this trade, sir,” the
saw-seller said, “but I was brought up to a very
different one. When a lad I worked in a coal-pit
along with my father, but his behaviour to me was
so cruel, he beat me so, that I ran away, and
walked every step from the north of England to
London. I can’t say I ever repented running
away&mdash;much as I’ve gone through. My money
was soon gone when I got to London, and my
way of speaking was laughed at. [He had now
very little of a provincial accent.] That’s fourteen
year back. Why, indeed, sir, it puzzles me to
tell you how I lived then when I did live. I
jobbed about the markets, and slept, when I could
pay for a lodging, at the cheap lodging-houses; so
I got into the way of selling a few things in the
streets, as I saw others do. I sold laces and
children’s handkerchiefs. Sometimes I was miserable
enough when I hadn’t a farthing, and if I
managed to make a sixpence I got tipsy on it. For
six weeks I slept every night in the Peckham
Union. For another five or six weeks I slept every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
night in the dark arches by the Strand. I’ve
sometimes had twenty or thirty companions there.
I used to lie down on the bare stones, and was
asleep in a minute, and slept like a top all night,
but waking was very bad. I felt stiff, and sore,
and cold, and miserable. How I lived at all is a
wonder to me. About eleven years ago I was persuaded
to go to a Temperance Meeting in Harp
Alley (Farringdon-street), and there I signed the
pledge; that is, I made my mark, for I can’t read
or write, which has been a great hinder to me. If
I’d been a scholard a teetotal gent would have
got me into the police three years ago, about the
time I got married. I did better, of course,
when I was a teetotaller&mdash;no more dark arches.
I sold a few little shawls in the streets
then, but it was hardly bread and butter and
coffee at times. Eight year ago I thought I
would try saw-selling: a shopkeeper advised me,
and I began on six salt saws, which I sold to oilmen.
They’re for cutting salt only, and are made
of zinc, as steel would rust and dirty the salt.
The trade was far better at first than it is now.
In good weeks I earned 16<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> In bad
weeks 10<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i> Now I may earn 10<i>s.</i>, not
more, a week, pretty regular: yesterday I made
only 6<i>d.</i> Oilmen are better customers than chance
street-buyers, for I’m known to them. There’s
only one man besides myself selling nothing
but saws. I walk, I believe, 100 miles every
week, and that I couldn’t do, I know, if I wasn’t
teetotal. I never long for a taste of liquor if
I’m ever so cold or tired. It’s all poisonous.”</p>

<p>The saws sold are 8 inch, which cost at the
swag-shops 8<i>s.</i> and 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a dozen; 10 inch, 9<i>s.</i>
and 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and so on, the price advancing according
to the increased size, to 18 inch, 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the dozen. Larger sizes are seldom sold in the
streets. The second man’s earnings, my informant
believed, were the same as his own.</p>

<p>The wife of my informant, when she got work
as an embroideress, could earn 11<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> At
present she was at work braiding dresses for a
dressmaker, at 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> each. By hard work, and if
she had not her baby to attend to, she could earn no
more than 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day. As it was she did not earn 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Beggar Street-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>Under this head I include only such of the beggar
street-sellers as are neither infirm nor suffering
from any severe bodily affliction or privation. I
am well aware that the aged&mdash;the blind&mdash;the lame
and the halt often <i>pretend</i> to sell small articles in
the street&mdash;such as boot-laces, tracts, cabbage-nets,
lucifer-matches, kettle-holders, and the like; and
that such matters are carried by them partly to keep
clear of the law, and partly to evince a disposition
to the public that they are willing to do something
for their livelihood. But these being really objects
of charity, they belong more properly to the
second main division of this book, in which the
poor, or those that can’t work, and their several
means of living, will be treated of.</p>

<p>Such, though beggars, are not “lurkers”&mdash;a
lurker being strictly one who loiters about for
some dishonest purpose. Many modes of thieving
as well as begging are termed “lurking”&mdash;the
“dead lurk,” for instance, is the expressive slang
phrase for the art of entering dwelling-houses
during divine service. The term “lurk,” however,
is mostly applied to the several modes of plundering
by representations of sham distress.</p>

<p>It is of these alone that I purpose here treating&mdash;or
rather of that portion of them which pretends
to deal in manufactured articles.</p>

<p>In a few instances the street-sellers of small
articles of utility are also the manufacturers.
Many, however, <i>say</i> they are the producers of the
things they offer for sale, thinking thus to evade
the necessity of having a hawker’s licence. The
majority of these petty dealers know little of the
manufacture of the goods they vend, being mere
tradesmen. Some few profess to be the makers of
their commodities, solely with the view of enlisting
sympathy, and thus either selling the trifles
they carry at an enormous profit, or else of obtaining
alms.</p>

<p>An inmate of one of the low lodging-houses has
supplied me with the following statement:&mdash;“Within
my recollection,” says my informant,
“the great branch of trade among these worthies,
was the sale of sewing cotton, either in skeins or
on reels. In the former case, the article cost the
‘lurkers’ about 8<i>d.</i> per pound; one pound would
produce thirty skeins, which, sold at one penny
each, or two for three halfpence, produced a heavy
profit. The lurkers could mostly dispose of three
pounds per day; the article was, of course, damaged,
rotten, and worthless.</p>

<p>“The mode of sale consisted in the ‘lurkers’ calling
at the several houses in a particular district,
and representing themselves as Manchester cotton
spinners out of employ. Long tales, of course,
were told of the distresses of the operatives, and of
the oppression of their employers; these tales had
for the most part been taught them at the padding-ken,
by some old and experienced dodger of
‘the school;’ and if the spokesman could patter
well, a much larger sum was frequently obtained
in direct alms than was reaped by the sale.”</p>

<p>Cotton on reels was&mdash;except to the purchaser&mdash;a
still better speculation; the reels were large,
handsomely mounted, and displayed in bold relief
such inscriptions as the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">
PIKE’S<br />
PATENT COTTON.<br />
120 <span class="smcap">Yards</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>The reader, however, must divide the “120
yards,” here mentioned, by 12, and then he will
arrive at something like the true secret as to
the quantity; for the surface only was covered by
the thread.</p>

<p>“The ‘cotton Lurk’ is now ‘cooper’d’ (worn
out); a more common dodge&mdash;and, of course, only
an excuse for begging&mdash;is to envelope a packet of
‘warranted’ needles, or a few inches of ‘real
Honiton lace’ in an envelope, with a few lines to
the ‘Lady of the House,’ or a printed bill, setting
forth the misery of the manufacturers, and the
intention of the parties leaving the ‘fakement’ to
presume to call for an answer in a few hours. I
subjoin a copy of one of these documents.</p>

<p class="center">‘ALLEN, Printer, Long-row, Nottingham.’</p></div>

<p>“These are left by one of ‘the school’ at
the houses of the gentry, a mark being placed
on the door post of such as are ‘bone’ or
‘gammy,’ in order to inform the rest of ‘the
school’ where to call, and what houses to avoid.
As the needles cost but a few pence per thousand,
and the lace less than one halfpenny per yard&mdash;a
few purchasers of the former at 1<i>s.</i> per packet
(25 needles), or of the latter at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per yard,
is what these ‘lurkers’ term a ‘fair day’s work for
a fair day’s wages.’</p>

<p>“Another and very extensive branch of the
pseudo-‘manufacturing’ fraternity is to be found
among the sham street-sellers of cutlery.</p>

<p>“At some of the least respectable of the swag-shops
may be bought all the paraphernalia requisite
in order to set up as the real manufacturer of
Sheffield and ‘Brummagem’ goods&mdash;including,
beside the cutlery, chamois-leather aprons, paper
caps (ready crushed, to give them the appearance
of age and usage), and last, but not least, a compound
of black lead and tallow, to ‘take the
granny’ off them as has white ’ands, so as the flat’s
shan’t ‘tumble’ to the ‘unworkmanlike’ appearance
of the palms of the ‘lurker.’</p>

<p>“Thus ‘got up’ for the part,” continues my
informant, “and provided with a case of razors,
which perhaps has cost him two groats, and (if he
can raise as much) a noggin o’ rum to ‘give him
cheek’ and make him ‘speak up’ to his victims&mdash;‘Jack
Beaver,’ the ‘king of the street-cutlers,’ will
sally forth, and meet, intercept, and follow any
gentleman who seems a ‘likely spec,’ till worried
perhaps by importunity, the ‘swell’ buys what he
does not want, and, I need scarcely add, what he
cannot use. Next, in importance, to ‘Jack Beaver,’
is the notorious ‘Pat Connor.’ Pat ‘does nothing
on the blob,’ that is to say (he does not follow
people and speak to them on the streets). His
‘dodge’&mdash;and it has been for years a successful
one&mdash;is to go round to the public offices, dressed
as before described, with the exception of being in
his shirt sleeves (he has every day a <i>clean</i> shirt),
and teaze the clerks till they purchase a pen-knife.
He has been known to sell from fifteen to twenty
knives in one day, at two shillings each, the first
cost being about threepence-halfpenny. Of course
he is often interrupted by porters and other
officials, but he always carries in one hand a roll
of wire, and a small hammer in the other, and
having got the name of some gentleman up stairs,
he pretends that he is going to mend Mr. So-and-so’s
bell. This worthy, a short time ago, made
free&mdash;in the Custom House&mdash;with a timepiece,
belonging to one of the clerks, for which the
‘Sheffield manufacturer’ got twelve months in
Newgate. I have not seen him since,” adds my
informant, “and therefore imagine that he is now
taking a provincial tour.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “House of Lords,” a Street-Seller’s
Defunct Club.</span></h3>

<p>I have given an account of a defunct club, of
which the “paper workers” were the chief members;
and I have now to do the same of a society
not very dissimilar in its objects, of which the
street-sellers of manufactured articles constituted
the great majority. It was called the “house of
lords,” and was established about eight years ago,
at the Roebuck-tavern, Holborn, and existed three
years. Its object was to relieve its members in
sickness. The subscription was 2<i>d.</i> a week, and
the relief to a sick member was as many pennies
a week as the club contained members, with, in
any pressing case, an additional halfpenny, which
the members paid into the fund, over and above
their weekly subscription. For the greater part
of its existence the club contained ninety members
(a few of them honorary), and there were
very few cases of “declaring on the fund” by
sick members. At one period for many weeks
there were no such declarations, and the “house
of lords” had 30<i>l.</i> in hand. One of the leading
members, a very intelligent man, who had “a
good connection in hardware,” had taken great
pains to prepare a code of rules, which, having
been approved by the other members, it was considered
time that the “house of lords” should be
enrolled. Delays, however, intervened. “To tell
you the truth, sir,” one of them said, “we were
afraid to employ an attorney, and thought of waiting
upon Mr. Tidd Pratt ourselves, but it wasn’t
to be.”</p>

<p>The club was, moreover, looked upon as somewhat
select. “No costers were admitted, sir,” I
was told by a hardware seller in the streets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
“not but what there’s many very industrious and
honest men among them, but they’re in a different
line, and are a different sort of people to us.” The
members met once a week, and, though they were
merry and talkative enough, drunkenness was
strongly discouraged. It was common for the
subscribers who were regarded as the “geniuses”
of the trade, to take counsel together, and “invent
any new move.” They were reputed to be knowing
among the most knowing, in all street arts
and dodges, and the way in which the club came
to an end, considering the strong claims to knowingness
of its members, was curious enough.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening a member who was considered
a respectable man, and was sufficiently
regular in his payments, appeared at the weekly
meeting, introducing his landlord, who, as a non-member,
had to pay 1<i>d.</i> for admission. The man
told how his family had suffered from illness, and
how he had been ill, and got into arrears of rent,
for he did not like to distress the fund; and how
his landlord was then in possession of his “sticks,”
which must be sold in the morning if he could
not pay 15<i>s.</i>; and, moreover, how his landlord&mdash;a
very kind-hearted, indulgent man&mdash;was forced
to do this, for he himself was in difficulties. The
members voted that the 15<i>s.</i> should be advanced;
but before the next meeting night it was discovered
that the statement of the poor member in
arrears was an imposition. The landlord was
merely a confederate; the worthy couple had
been drinking together, and, to prolong their
tippling, had hit upon the roguish scheme I have
mentioned.</p>

<p>This, among other things, lowered the confidence
of the members. The numbers fell off until it
was thought best to “wind up the concern.” The
small funds in hand were fairly apportioned among
the remaining members, and the club ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>Another Street-sellers’ Club has recently been
formed by the men themselves, of which the following
is the prospectus, and it is to be hoped that this
attempt on the part of the street-folk to better
their condition will meet with a better fate than
its <span class="lock">predecessor:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We now come to a new class of the street-sellers
of manufactured articles&mdash;viz., the “crocks,”
as they are termed. I have before alluded to
one characteristic of these traders&mdash;that they
all strive to be barterers in preference to salesmen.
They also present other varying qualities
when compared with other classes of street-sellers.
Of these “crocks,” there are, from the best data I
could obtain from men in the trade, and from the
swag-shop people who supply them, 250 men and
150 women; of these, 120 couples (man and
woman) “work” together; of the remainder, sometimes
two men work in unison, and some women
work singly. On my inquiring of one of these
street folk if ever three worked together, I was
told that such was never the case, as the “crocks”
would quote a saying: “Two’s good company,
three’s none at all.” Of the men and women
carrying on this traffic conjointly more than half
are married; showing a difference of habits to the
costermongers. The reason assigned to me by
one of the class (himself once a costermonger) was
that the interest of the man and woman in the
business was closer than in costermongering, while
the serviceableness of a woman helpmate in “swopping,”
or bartering, was much greater. This prompts
the women, I am told, even if they are unmarried
at the outset, to insist upon wedlock; and the man&mdash;sometimes,
perhaps, to secure a valuable “help,”
at others, it may be, from better motives&mdash;consents
to what in this rank of life, and under the circumstances
of such street-traders, is more frequently
the woman’s offer than the man’s. The trade, in
its present form, has not been known more than
twelve years.</p>

<p>The goods, which are all bought at the crock
swag-shops, of which an account is given below, are
carried in baskets on the head, the men having
pads on the cloth caps which they wear&mdash;or sometimes
a padding of hay or wool inside the cap&mdash;while
the women’s pads are worn outside their
bonnets or caps, the bonnet being occasionally
placed on the basket. The goods, though carried
in baskets on the head to the locality of the traffic,
are, whilst the traffic is going on, usually borne
from house to house, or street to street, on the
arm, or when in large baskets carried before them
by the two hands. These baskets are strongly made;
the principal mart is close to Spitalfields-market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>The men engaged in this trade are usually
strong, robust, and red-faced. Most of them are
above the middle stature; very few are beyond
middle age, and the majority of them are under or
little more than 30. The women, more than the
men, have contracted a stoop or bend to one side,
not so much by carrying weights on the head, as
by carrying them on the arm. The weights they
carry are from three to five stone. The dress of
the men is the same as the costermongers, with the
exception of shooting-cut jackets being more
frequent among the “crocks” than the costers, and
red plush waistcoats are very popular with them.
When not at work, or on Sundays&mdash;for they never
work on the Sabbath, though they do not go to
church or chapel&mdash;these men are hardly ever seen
to wear a hat. Both men and women wear strong
boots and, unless when “hard-up,” silk handkerchiefs.
Their places of residence are, as regards the
majority, in Spitalfields, Bethnal-green, and Shoreditch.
Of the others the greater portion reside in
the neighbourhood of Kent-street, in the Borough.
Their abode usually consists of one room, which
is in most cases more comfortable, and better furnished
than those of the costers. “We pick up
a tidy ornament now and then,” one crock said,
“such as a picture, in the way of swop, and our
good women likes to keep them at home for a bit
of show.” They live well, in general, dining out
almost every day; and I am told that, as a body,
they have fewer children than any other class of
street-folk.</p>

<p>The trade is almost entirely itinerant. Crock-sellers
are to be seen at street-markets on Saturday
nights, but they are not the regular crocks, who,
as I have said, do not care to <i>sell</i>. The crocks go
on “rounds,” the great trade being in the
suburbs. Sometimes a round lasts a week, the
couple resting at a fresh place every night. Others
have a round for each day of the week.</p>

<p>The long rounds are to Greenwich, Woolwich,
Northfleet, Gravesend, Stroud, Rochester, Chatham,
and then to Maidstone. Some will then
make Maidstone the head-quarters, and work the
neighbouring villages&mdash;such as East Farleigh,
Town Malling, Yalding, Aylesford, and others.
The return to town may be direct by railway, or
by some other route, if any stock remains unsold.
On these long rounds the higher priced goods are
generally carried, and stock is forwarded from
London to the “crock” whilst on the round, if
the demand require it. Another long round is
Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Kingston-on-Thames, and
Guildford, with divergings to the villages. The
return from Guildford is often by Richmond, Kew,
&amp;c. A third long round is Hampstead, Kilburn,
Barnet, Watford, and so on to St. Alban’s. The
other long rounds are less frequented; but some
go to Uxbridge; others to Windsor and Eton, and
as far as Reading; others to Cambridge, by Tottenham,
Edmonton, Ware, &amp;c. When no trade is
to be done close to London, the “crocks” often
have themselves and their wares conveyed to any
town by rail. The short, or town rounds, are the
Dover-road, New Kent-road, Walworth, Camberwell,
and back by Newington; Kennington, Brixton,
Clapham, and back by Vauxhall; Bayswater,
Notting-hill, and back by Paddington; Camden
Town, St. John’s Wood, and Hampstead; Stoke
Newington, Dalston, Clapton, Shacklewell, and
Stamford-hill; Mile-end, Stratford, and Bow;
Limehouse, Poplar, and back by the Commercial-road.
It would be easy to cite other routes, but
these show the character of the trade. Some
occupy two days. A few crocks “work” the
poor neighbourhoods, such as Hoxton, Kingsland-road,
parts of Hackney, &amp;c., and cry, “Here we
are&mdash;now, ladies, bring out your old hats, old
clothes, old umbrellers, old anythink; old shoes,
metal, old anythink; <i>here</i> we are!”</p>

<p>The trade, from the best information I could
acquire, is almost equally divided into what may
be called “fancy” and “useful” articles. A
lodging-letter, for instance, will “swop” her old
gowns and boots, and drive keen bargains for
plates, dishes, or wash-hand basins and jugs. A
housekeeper, who may be in easier circumstances,
will exchange for vases and glass wares. Servant-maids
swop clothes and money for a set of china,
“’gainst they get married.” Perhaps there are no
more frequent collisions between buyer and seller
than in the crock swag-shops. A man who had
once been an assistant in one of these places, told
me that some of the “crocks” were tiresome beyond
measure, and every now and then a minute or two
was wasted by the “crock” and the swag-shopman
in swearing one at another. Some of these
street traffickers insist upon testing the soundness
of <i>every</i> article, by striking the middle finger nail
against it. This they do to satisfy their customers
also, in the course of trade, especially in poor
neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>From the best data at my command, one quarter
of the goods sold at the swag-shops are sold to
the crock dealers I have described, and in about
equal proportions as to amount in fancy or useful
articles. There are, in addition to the crock barterers,
perhaps 100 traders who work the poor
streets, chiefly carrying their goods in barrows,
but they <i>sell</i>, and though they will barter, do not
clamour for it. They cry: “Free trade for ever!
Here’s cup and saucer for a halfpenny! Pick ’em
out at your own price! Tea-pot for three half-pence!
Pick ’em out! Oho! oho! Giving
away here!” They rattle dishes and basins
as they make this noise. These men are all supplied
at the swag-shops, buying what is called
“common lots,” and selling at 30 per cent. profit.
Such traders have only been known in the
streets for five years, and for three or four months
of the year half of these “go to costering.” The
barrows are about seventy in number, and there
are thirty stalls. Seven-eighths of the “barrow-crocks”
are men. The swag-barrowmen also
sell small articles of crockery wares, and altogether
one half of the trade of the crock swag-shops
(which I have described) is a trade for
the streets.</p>

<p>BARTERING FOR OLD CLOTHES.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of the way in which the “crock barterers” dispose
of their wares, &amp;c., I have given an account
below. They are rapidly supplanting the “old
clo’” trade of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>The hucksters of crockery-ware are a considerable
class. One who has great experience in the
business thinks there must be some hundreds
employed in it throughout London. He says he
meets many at the swag warehouses on the evenings
that he goes there. He is often half an hour
before he can be served. There are seven or
eight swag warehouses frequented by the hucksters,
and at the busy time my informant has
often seen as many as twenty-five at each house,
and he is satisfied that there must be three or four
hundred hucksters of china and glass throughout
the metropolis. The china and glass in which
they deal are usually purchased at the east end of
the town, upon the understanding that if the
huckster is unable to dispose of them in the course
of the day the articles will be taken back in the
morning, if uninjured, and the money returned.
The hucksters usually take out their goods early
in the day. Their baskets are commonly deposited
at the warehouse, and each warehouse has from
thirty to forty baskets left there over-night, when
the unsold articles are returned. The baskets are
usually filled with china and glass and ornaments,
to the amount of from 5<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>, according to the
stock-money of the huckster. A basket filled
with 15<i>s.</i> worth of china is considered, I am told,
“a very tidy stock.” In the same neighbourhood
as they get the crockery, are made the baskets in
which it is carried. For these baskets they pay
from 2<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i>, and they are made expressly for
the hucksters; indeed, on one side of a well-known
street at the east end, the baskets made in
the cellars may be seen piled outside the houses
up to the second-floor windows. The class of
persons engaged in hawking china through the
metropolis are either broken-down tradesmen or
clerks out of place, or Jews, or they may be Staffordshire
men, who have been regularly bred to the
business. They carry different kinds of articles.
The Staffordshire man may generally be known by
the heavy load of china that he carries with him.
He has few light or fancy articles in his basket;
it is filled chiefly with plates and dishes and
earthenware pans. The broken-down tradesmen
carries a lighter load. He prefers tea services and
vases, and rummers and cruet-stands, as they are
generally of a more delicate make than the articles
carried by the Staffordshire men. The Jew, however,
will carry nothing of any considerable weight.
He takes with him mostly light, showy, Bohemian
goods&mdash;which are difficult “to be priced” by his
customers, and do not require much labour to
hawk about. The hucksters usually start on their
rounds about nine. There are very few who take
money; indeed they profess to take none at all.
“But that is all flam,” said my informant. “If
any one was to ask me the price of an article in
an artful way like, I shouldn’t give him a straight-forward
answer. To such parties we always say,
‘Have you got any old clothes?’” The hucksters
<i>do</i> take money when they can get it, and they
adopt the principle of exchanging their goods for
old clothes merely as a means of evading the
licence. Still they are compelled to do a great deal
in the old clothes’ line. When they take money
they usually reckon to get 4<i>d.</i> in the shilling, but
at least three-fourths of their transactions consist
of exchanges for old clothes. “A good tea-service
we generally give,” said my informant, “for
a left-off suit of clothes, hat, and boots&mdash;they must
all be in a decent condition to be worth that. We
give a sugar-basin for an old coat, and a rummer
for a pair of old Wellington boots. For a glass
milk-jug I should expect a waistcoat and trowsers,
and they must be tidy ones too. But there’s
nothing so saleable as a pair of old boots to us.
There is always a market for old boots, when
there is not for old clothes. You can any day get
a dinner out of old Wellingtons; but as for coats
and waistcoats&mdash;there’s a fashion about them, and
what pleases one don’t another. I can sell
a pair of old boots going along the streets
if I carry them in my hand. The snobs
will run after us to get them&mdash;the backs are so
valuable. Old beaver hats and waistcoats are
worth little or nothing. Old silk hats, however,
there’s a tidy market for. They are bought for
the shops, and are made up into new hats for the
country. The shape is what is principally wanted.
We won’t give a farden for the polka hats with
the low crowns. If we can double an old hat up
and put it in our pockets, it’s more valuable to us
than a stiff one. We know that the shape must be
good to stand that. As soon as a hatter touches
a hat he knows by the touch or the stiffness of it
whether it’s been ‘through’ the fire or not; and
if so, they’ll give it you back in a minute. There is
one man who stands in Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street,
waiting to buy the hats of us as we
go into the market, and who purchases at least
thirty dozen of us a week. There will be three
or four there besides him looking out for us as
we return from our rounds, and they’ll either
outbid one another, according as the demand is,
or they’ll all hold together to give one price.
The same will be done by other parties wanting
the old umbrellas that we bring back with us.
These are valuable principally for the whalebone.
Cane ribbed ones are worth only from 1<i>d.</i> to 2<i>d.</i>,
and that’s merely the value of the stick and the
supporters. Iron skewers are made principally out of
the old supporters of umbrellas.” The china and
crockery bought by the hucksters at the warehouses
are always second-rate articles. They are most of
them a little damaged, and the glass won’t stand
hot water. Every huckster, when he starts, has
a bag, and most of them two&mdash;the one for the
inferior, and the other for the better kind of old
clothes he buys. “We purchase gentlemen’s left-off
wearing apparel. This is mostly sold to us by
women. They are either the wives of tradesmen
or mechanics who sell them to us, or else it is the
servant of a lodging-house, who has had the things
given to her, and with her we can deal much
easier than the others. She’s come to ’em light,
and of course she parts with ’em light,” said the
man, “and she’ll take a pair of sugar basins worth
about 6<i>d.</i>, you know, for a thing that’ll fetch two
or three shillings sometimes. But the mistresses
of the houses are she-dragons. They wants a
whole dinner <i>chany</i> service for their husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
rags. As for plates and dishes, they think they
can be had for picking up. Many a time they
sells their husband’s things unbeknown to ’em,
and often the gentleman of the house coming up
to the door, and seeing us make a deal&mdash;for his
trowsers maybe&mdash;puts a stop to the whole transaction.
Often and often I’ve known a woman
sell the best part of her husband’s stock of clothes
for <i>chany</i> ornaments for her mantelpiece. And
I’m sure the other day a lady stripped the whole
of her passage, and gave me almost a new great
coat, that was hanging up in the hall, for a few
trumpery tea-things. But the greatest ‘screws’
we has to deal with are some of the ladies in the
squares. They stops you on the sly in the streets,
and tells you to call at their house at sitch a hour
of the day, and when you goes there they smuggles
you quietly into some room by yourselves, and
then sets to work Jewing away as hard as they
can, pricing up their own things, and downcrying
yourn. Why, the other day I was told to call at
a fashionable part of Pimlico, so I gave a person
3<i>d.</i> to mind the child, and me and my good
woman started off at eight in the morning with a
double load. But, bless you, when we got there,
the lady took us both into a private room unbeknown
to the servants, and wanted me to go and
buy expressly for her a green and white chamber
service all complete, with soap trays and brush
trays, together with four breakfast cups&mdash;and all
this here grand set-out she wanted for a couple of
old washed-out light waistcoats, and a pair of light
trowsers. She tried hard to make me believe that
the buttons alone on the waistcoats was worth
6<i>d.</i> a piece, but I knowed the value of buttons
afore she was borned; at first start off I’m sure
they wouldn’t have cost 1<i>d.</i> each, so I couldn’t
make a deal of it no how, and I had to take
all my things back for my trouble. I asked her
even for a pint of beer, but she wouldn’t listen to
no such thing. We generally cry as we go, ‘any
old clothes to sell or exchange,’ and I look down
the area, and sometimes knock at the door. If
I go out with a 15<i>s.</i> basket of crockery, may be
after a tidy day’s work I shall come home with
1<i>s.</i> in my pocket (perhaps I shall have <i>sold</i> a
couple of tumblers, or half a dozen plates), and
a bundle of old clothes, consisting of two or
three old shirts, a coat or two, a suit of left-off
livery, a woman’s gown may be, or a pair
of old stays, a couple of pair of Wellingtons, and
a waistcoat or so. These I should have at my
back, and the remainder of my <i>chany</i> and glass on
my head, and werry probably a humberella or
two under my arm, and five or six old hats in my
hand. This load altogether will weigh about
three quarters of a cwt., and I shall have travelled
fifteen miles with that, at least; for as fast as I
gets rid on the weight of the crockery, I takes up
the weight of the old clothes. The clothes I
hardly know the value on till I gets to the Clothes
Exchange, in Houndsditch. The usual time for
the hucksters arriving there is between three and
four in the winter, or between five and six in the
summer. In fact, we must be at the Exchange at
them hours, because there all our buyers is, and
we can’t go out the next day until we’ve sold our
lot. We can’t have our baskets stocked again
until we’ve got the money for our old clothes.”
The Exchange is a large square plot of damp
ground, about an acre in extent, enclosed by a
hoarding about eight feet high, on the top of
which is a narrow sloping roof, projecting sufficiently
forward to shelter one person from the
rain. Across this ground are placed four rows of
double seats, ranged back to back. Here meet all
the Jew clothesmen, hucksters, dealers in second-hand
shoes, left-off wardrobe keepers, hareskin
dealers, umbrella dealers and menders, and indeed
buyers and sellers of left-off clothes and worn-out
commodities of every description. The purchasers
are of all nations, and in all costumes. Some are
Greeks, others Swiss, and others Germans; some
have come there to buy up old rough charity
clothing and army coats for the Irish market,
others have come to purchase the hareskins and
old furs, or else to pick up cheap old teapots and
tea-urns. The man with the long flowing beard
and greasy tattered gaberdine is worth thousands,
and he has come to make another sixpence out of
the rags and tatters that are strewn about the
ground in heaps for sale. At a little before three
o’clock the stream of rag-sellers sets in in a flood
towards this spot. At the gate stands “Barney
Aaron,” to take the half-penny admission of every
one entering the ground. By his side stands his
son with a leather pouch of half-pence, to give
change for any silver that may be tendered. The
stench of the old clothes is positively overpowering.
Every one there is dressed in his <i>worst</i>. If
he has any good clothes he would not put them on.
Almost each one that enters has a bag at his back,
and scarcely has he passed the gate before he is
surrounded by some half dozen eager Jews&mdash;one
feels the contents of the bundle on the huckster’s
back&mdash;another clamours for the first sight. A
third cries, “I’m sure you have something that’ll
suit me.” “You know me,” says a fourth, “I’m
a buyer, and give a good price.” “Have you got
any breaking?” asks this Jew, who wants an old
coat or two to cut up into cloth caps&mdash;“Have you
got any fustian, any old cords, or old boats?”
And such is the anxiety and greediness of the
buyers, that it is as much as the seller can do to
keep his bundle on his back. At length he forces
his way to a seat, and as he empties the contents
of his sack on the ground, each different article is
snapped up and eagerly overhauled by the different
Jews that have followed him to his seat. Then
they all ask what sum is wanted for the several
things, and they, one and all, bid one quarter of
the price demanded. I am assured that it requires
the greatest vigilance to prevent the things being
carried off unpaid in the confusion. While this
scene is going on, a Jew, perched upon a high
stage in the centre of the ground, shouts aloud to
the multitude, “Hot wine, a half-penny a glass,
here.” Beside him stands another, with smoking
cans of hot eels; and next to this one is a sweet-meat
stall, with a crowd of Jew boys gathered
round the keeper of it, gambling with marbles
for Albert rock and hardbake. Up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
between the seats push women with baskets
of sheep’s trotters on their arms, and screaming,
“Legs of mutton, two for a penny; who’ll
give me a handsel&mdash;who’ll give me a handsel?”
After them comes a man with a large tin
can under his arm, and roaring, “Hot pea, oh!
hot pea, oh!” In one corner is a coffee and beer
shop. Inside this are Jews playing at draughts,
or settling and wrangling about the goods they
have bought of one another. In fact, in no other
place is such a scene of riot, rags, and filth to be
witnessed. The cause of this excitement is the
great demand on the part of the poor, and the cheap
clothiers as well, for those articles which are considered
as worthless by the rich. The old shoes
are to be cobbled up, and the cracks heel-balled
over, and sold out to the working-classes as strong
durable articles. The Wellingtons are to be new
fronted, and disposed of to clerks who are expected
to appear respectable upon the smallest salaries.
The old coats and trowsers are wanted for the
slop-shops; they are to be “turned,” and made up
into new garments. The best black suits are to
be “clobbered” up&mdash;and those which are more
worn in parts are to be cut up and made into new
cloth caps for young gentlemen, or gaiters for poor
curates; whilst others are to be transformed into
the “best boys’ tunics.” Such as are <i>too</i> far gone
are bought to be torn to pieces by the “devil,”
and made up into new cloth&mdash;or “shoddy” as it
is termed&mdash;while such as have already done this
duty are sold for manure for the ground. The old
shirts, if they are past mending, are bought as
“rubbish” by the marine store dealers, and sold
as rags to the paper-mills, to be changed either
into the bank-note, the newspaper, or the best
satin note-paper.</p>

<p>The average earnings of the hucksters who exchange
crockery, china and glass for the above
articles, are from 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> per week. Some
days, I am told, they will make 3<i>s.</i>, and on others
they will get only 6<i>d.</i> However, taking the good
with the bad, it is thought that 10<i>s.</i> a week is
about a fair average of the earnings of the whole
class. The best times for this trade are at the
turn of the winter, and at the summer season, because
then people usually purchase new clothes,
and are throwing off the old ones. The average
price of an old hat is from 1<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i>; for an old
pair of shoes, from 1<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i>; an old pair of Wellingtons
fetch from 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (those of French
leather are of scarcely any value). An old coat
is worth from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>; waistcoats are valued
from 1<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i>; trowsers are worth from 4<i>d.</i> to
8<i>d.</i>; cotton gowns are of the same value; bonnets
are of no value whatever; shirts fetch from 2<i>d.</i> to
6<i>d.</i>; stockings are 1<i>d.</i> per pair; a silk handkerchief
varies in value from 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> The party
supplying me with the above information was
originally in the coal and greengrocery business,
but, owing to a succession of calamities, he has
been unable to carry it on. Since then he has
taken to the vending of crockery in the streets.
He is a man far above the average of the class to
which he at present belongs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Swag,” Crockery, and Glass Shops.</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the 150 general and particular
“swag-shops,” or shops having a large <i>collection</i>
of goods, of which I have spoken, there are
twenty establishments for the sale of crockery and
china, which I heard styled by persons in the
trade “swag-crocks,” or “crock-shops.” The principle
on which the trade is conducted in these
places is the same as that of the swag-shops,
inasmuch as the sales are wholesale, to street-sellers,
shop-keepers, and shippers, but rarely to
private individuals.</p>

<p>The crock swag-shops are to be found in the
streets neighbouring Spitalfields market, and in
and near to Liquorpond-street. As at the more
general or miscellaneous swag-shops, the crock-swags
make no display. In one of the most
extensive, indeed, two large windows are filled
with goods. Here are spirit-stands, with the
invariable three bottles (invariable in the cheap
trade), blue, green, or uncoloured; some lettered
“gin,” “rum,” “brandy,” but most of them unlabelled.
Here, too, are cruet-stands, and “pot” or
spar figures under glass shades; and a number of
many-coloured flower-glasses, some of them profusely
gilded; and small china vases; but the
glass wares greatly predominate. Although there
are glass and colour and gilding enough to make
“an imposing display,” the display is nevertheless
anything but showy; the goods look dingy, and,
if I may so speak of such things, faded. Some of
the coloured glass seems to be losing its colour,
and few of the wares have the bright look of
newness.</p>

<p>The windows of these shops are, for the most
part, literally <i>packed</i> to a certain height, so as
almost to exclude the light, with pitchers, and
basins, and cups, and jugs, and the sundry smaller
articles of this multifarious trade, all undusted,
and seemingly uncared for. In one “large concern”
I saw a number of glass salt-cellars wrapped
severally in paper, which had changed from white
to a dusty brown, and which from age, and perhaps
damp, seemed about to fall to tatters.</p>

<p>The “interiors” of some of these warehouses
are very spacious. I saw one large and lofty
shop, into which two apartments and a yard had
been flung, the partitions having been taken down,
and the ceilings supported by pillars, in order to
“extend the premises.” It was really a hall of
pots. On the floor were large crates, the tops
removed so that the goods might be examined,
packed, one with cups, another with saucers, a
third with basins, and packed as only a potter
could pack them. Intermixed with them were
piles of blue-and-white dishes and plates, and,
beside them, washing-pans, fitted one into another
like the old hats on a Jew’s head. The pillars
had their festoons of crockery, being hung with
children’s white and gold mugs “for a good boy,”
and with white metal-lidded and brown-bodied
mustard pots, as well as other minor articles.
The shelves were loaded with tea-services of many
shapes and hues, while the unoccupied space was
what sufficed to allow the warehousemen and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
customers to thread the mazes of this labyrinth of
crockerywares. Of the glass goods there was little
display, as they are generally kept in cases and
other packages, to preserve their freshness of
appearance.</p>

<p>The crockery of the swag-shops is made in
Staffordshire; the glass principally in Lancashire.
At none of these establishments do they issue circulars
of prices, such as I have cited of the general
swag-shops. The articles are so very many, I was
told, that to specify all the sizes and prices “would
take a volume and a half.” I give a statement,
however, of the prices of the goods most in demand,
on the occasions when the street vendors
sell them without barter, and the prices at which
they are purchased wholesale: Blue-edged plates
sold at 1<i>d.</i> each cost 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> the dozen; this would
appear to entail a loss of 8<i>d.</i> on every dozen sold,
but in this article “30 is a dozen.” Dishes are
bought at the “swag-crocks” in “nests,” which
comprise 10 dishes, or 5 pairs, of different sizes.
These the street crockman sells, if possible, in
pairs, but he will sell them singly, for he can always
make up the complement of his “nest” at
the warehouse. The prices run, chiefly according
to size, from 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (sometimes 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) the
pair. “The 8<i>d.</i> a pair,” said one street crock-seller,
“costs me 6<i>d.</i>, not a farthing under, and
the 18<i>d.</i> a pair&mdash;it’s very seldom we can ‘draw’
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&mdash;costs 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> That’s all, sir; and the
profit’s so small, it makes us keen to swop. I’ll
swop for old clothes, or dripping, or grease, or anything.
You see the profit, when you sells downright
down, <i>must</i> be small, ’cause there’s so many
pot-shops with prices marked on the plates and
other things. They can buy better than us sometimes,
and they’re hard to stand up against. If a
woman says to me&mdash;for I very seldom deal with
men&mdash;‘Why, they’re cheaper at D&mdash;&mdash;’s, in Oxford-street,’&mdash;I
answers, ‘And worser. I’ll tell
you what it is, ma’am. The cheapest place was in
two houses, painted all red, in the London-road.
But one fine morning them two houses fell, and
the pots was smashed as a matter of course. It
was a judgment on their bad pots.’ But it’s a fact,
sir, that these houses fell, about 7 or 8 years ago,
I think, and I’ve seen goods, with one or two of
’em broken, offered for sale when the place was
re-built, having been ‘rescued from the ruins; and
at less than half price.’ Of course that was
gammon. I’ve cracked and broke a few plates,
myself, and sold them in the New Kent-road, and
in Walworth and Newington, at half price, from
the ruins, and at a very tidy profit.” A stone
china tea-service, of 32 pieces&mdash;12 cups, 12 saucers,
4 bread-and-butter plates, a tea-pot, a sugar-basin,
a slop-basin, and a cream-jug&mdash;is bought for 6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
while 9<i>s.</i> is asked for it, and sometimes obtained.
A “china set” costs, as the general price, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and for it 14<i>s.</i> is asked.</p>

<p>The glass wares are so very rarely sold&mdash;being
the most attractive articles of barter&mdash;that I could
hardly get any street-seller to state his prices.
“Swop, sir,” I was told repeatedly, “they all goes
in swop.” The glass goods, however, which are
the most sold in the streets, I ascertained to be
cream-jugs, those vended at 6<i>d.</i> each, costing 4<i>s.</i>
the dozen; and flower-glasses, the most frequent
price being 1<i>s.</i> a pair, the prime cost 7<i>d.</i></p>

<p>I have estimated the sum turned over by the
general swag-shops at 3000<i>l.</i> each. From what
I can learn, the crock swag-shops, averaging the
whole, turn over a larger sum, for their profits are
smaller, ranging from 10 to 30 per cent., but
rarely 30. Calculating, then, that each of these
swag-shops turns over 4000<i>l.</i> yearly, we find
80,000<i>l.</i> expended, but this includes the sales to
shopkeepers and to shippers, as well as to street-folk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Spar and China
Ornaments, and of Stone Fruit.</span></h3>

<p>“Spars,” as spar ornaments are called by the
street-sellers, are sold to the retailers at only four
places in London, and two in Gravesend (where
the hawkers are for the most part supplied). The
London spar-houses are&mdash;two in Westminster, one
in Shoreditch, and one on Battle-bridge. None of
them present any display of their goods which are
kept in large drawers, closets, and packages. At
Gravesend the spar-shops are handsome.</p>

<p>These wares are principally of Derbyshire spar,
and made in Matlock; a few are German. The
“spars” are hawked on a round, and are on fine
Saturday nights offered for sale in the street and
markets. The trade was unknown as a street, or
a hawking trade in London, I am informed, until
about twenty-five years ago, and then was not extensive,
the goods, owing to the cost of carriage,
&amp;c., being high-priced. As public conveyance
became more rapid, certain and cheap, the trade in
spars increased, and cheaper articles were prepared
for the London market. From ten to
fifteen years ago the vendors of spars “did well
in swop” (as street-sellers always call barters).
The articles with which they tempted housewives
were just the sort of article to which it was
difficult for inexperienced persons to attach a
value. They were massive and handsome ornaments,
and the spar-sellers did not fail to expatiate
on their many beauties. “God rest Jack Moody’s
soul,” said an Irishman, now a crock-seller, to me;
“Jack Moody was only his nick-name, but that
don’t matter; God rist his sowl and the hivens
be his bid. He was the boy to sell the spar-r’s.
They was from the cavrents at the bottom of the
say, he towld them, or from a new island in the
frozen ocean. He did well; God rist him; but
he died young.” The articles “swopped” were
such as I have described in my account of the
tradings of the crock-sellers; and if the “swop”
were in favour of the spar-seller, still the customer
became possessed of something solid, enduring,
and generally handsome.</p>

<p>At the outset of the street or hawking trade,
the spar-sellers carried their goods done up in
paper, in strong baskets on their heads; the man’s
wife sometimes carrying a smaller basket, with
less burdensome articles, on her arm. Men have
been known to start on a round, with a basket of
spars, which would weigh from 1 cwt. to 1&frac12; cwt.
(or 12 stone). This, it must be remembered, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
have to be borne for three or four miles into the
suburbs, before its weight was diminished by a
sale. One of these traders told me that twelve
years ago he had sold spar watch-stands, weighing
above 15 lbs. These stands were generally of a
square form; the inner portion being open, except
a sort of recess for the watch. “The tick sounds
well on spar, I’ve often heard,” said one spar-seller.</p>

<p>Some of the spar ornaments are plain, white,
and smooth. Of these many have flowers, or
rims, or insects, painted upon them, and in brilliant
colours. Those which are now in demand for the
street sales, or for itinerant barterings, are&mdash;Small
microscopes, candlesticks, inkstands, pin-cushions,
mugs, paper-holders, match perfumery,
and shaving-boxes, etc. The general price of these
articles is 6<i>d.</i> to the street-seller or hawker, some
of the dealers being licensed hawkers. The wholesale
price varies from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> per dozen; or
an average of 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> Of the larger articles
the most saleable are candlesticks, at from 1<i>s.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each; from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> being the most
frequent price. Watch-stands and vases are now,
I am told, in small demand. “People’s got
stocked, I think,” one man said, “and there’s so
much cheap glass and chaney work, that they looks
on spars as heavy and old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>Some street-sellers have their spars in covered
barrows, the goods being displayed when the top
of the barrow is removed, so that the conveyance
is serviceable whether the owner be stationary or
itinerant. The spar-sellers, however, are reluctant
to expose their goods to the weather, as the colours
are easily affected.</p>

<p>In this trade I am informed that there are
now twelve men, nine of whom are assisted by
their wives, and that in the summer months there
are eighteen. Their profits are about 15<i>s.</i> per
week on an average of the whole year, including the
metropolis and a wide range of the suburbs. What
amount of money may be expended by the public
in the street purchase of “spars” I am unable to
state, so much being done in the way of barter;
but assuming that there are fourteen sellers
throughout the year, and that their profits are
cent. per cent., there would appear to be about
1000<i>l.</i> per annum thus laid out.</p>

<p>Of stone fruit there are now usually six street
sellers, and in fine weather eight. Eight or ten
years ago there were twenty. The fruit is principally
made at Chesterfield in Derbyshire, and is
disposed of to the London street-sellers in the
swag-shops in Houndsditch. Some of the articles,
both as regards form and colour, are well executed;
others are far too red or too green; but that, I
was told, pleased children best. The most saleable
fruits are apples, pears, peaches, apricots, oranges,
lemons and cucumbers. The cucumbers, which
are sometimes of pot as well as of stone, are often
hollow, and are sometimes made to serve for gin-bottles,
holding about a quartern.</p>

<p>The price at the swag-shops is 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for a gross
of fruit of all kinds in equal quantities; for a better
quality the price is 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The street-seller endeavours
to get 1<i>d.</i> each for the lower priced, and
2<i>d.</i> for the higher, but has most frequently to be
content with &frac12;<i>d.</i> and 1<i>d.</i> The stone fruitmen are
itinerant during the week and stationary in the
street markets on Saturday, and sometimes other
evenings. They carry their stock both in baskets
and barrows. One man told me that he always
cried, “Pick ’em out! pick ’em out! Half-penny
each! Cheapest fruit ever seen! As good to-morrow
as last week! Never lose flavour! Ever-lasting
fruit.”</p>

<p>Supposing that there are six persons selling
stone fruit in the streets through the year, and
that each earns&mdash;and I am assured that is the full
amount&mdash;9<i>s.</i> weekly (one man said 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was
the limit of his weekly profits in fruit), we find
140<i>l.</i> received as profit on these articles, and calculating
the gains at 33 per cent., an outlay of
420<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The trade in China ornaments somewhat differs
from the others I have described under the present
head. It is both a street and a public-house
trade, and is carried on both in the regular way
and by means of raffles. At some public-houses,
indeed, the China ornament dealers are called
“rafflers.”</p>

<p>The “ornaments” now most generally sold or
raffled are Joy and Grief (two figures, one laughing
and the other crying); dancing Highlanders;
mustard pots in the form of cottages, &amp;c.; grotesque
heads, one especially of an old man, which
serves as a pepper-box, the grains being thrown
through the eyes, nose, and mouth; Queen and
Alberts (but not half so well as the others); and,
until of late, Smith O’Briens. There are others,
also, such as I have mentioned in my account of
the general swag-shops, to the windows of many
of which they form the principal furniture. Some
of these “ornaments” sold “on the sly” can
hardly be called obscene, but they are dirty, and
cannot be further described.</p>

<p>The most lucrative part of the trade is in the
raffling. A street-seller after doing what business
he can, on a round or at a stand, during the day,
will in the evening resort to public-houses, where
he is known, and is allowed to offer his wares to
the guests. The ornaments, in public-house sale,
are hardly ever offered for less than 6<i>d.</i> each, or
6<i>d.</i> a pair. The raffling is carried on rapidly and
simply. Dice are very rarely used new, and when
used, provoke many murmurs from the landlords.
The raffler of the China ornaments produces a
portable roulette box or table&mdash;these tables becoming
an established part of the street traffic&mdash;eight
or ten inches in diameter. What may be called
“the board” of some of these “roulettes” is
numbered to thirty-two. It is set rapidly spinning
on a pivot, a pea is then slipped through a
hole in the lid of the box, and, when the motion
has ceased, the pea is found in one of the numbered
partitions. “Now, gentlemen,” a raffler told
me he would say, “try your luck for this beautiful
pair of ornaments; six of you at 1<i>d.</i> a piece. If
you go home rather how came you so, show what
you’ve bought for the old lady, and it’ll be all
right and peaceful.” If six persons contribute 1<i>d.</i>
each, the one “spinning” the highest number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
gains the prize, and is congratulated by the ornament
seller on having gained for 1<i>d.</i> what was
only too cheap at 6<i>d.</i> “Why, sir,” said a man
who had recently left the trade for another calling,
and who was anxious that I should not give any
particular description of him, “in case he went
back to the raffling,”&mdash;“Why, sir, I remember
one Monday evening four or five months back,
going into a parlour, not a tap-room, mind, where
was respectable mechanics. They got to play
with me, and got keen, and played until my stock
was all gone. If one man stopped raffling,
another took his place. I can’t recollect how
many ornaments I raffled, but I cleared rather
better than 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> When there was no ornaments
left they gave me 1<i>d.</i> a piece&mdash;there was eleven of
them then&mdash;and a pint of beer to let them have the
roulette till 12 o’clock; and away they went
at it for beer and screws, and bets of 1<i>d.</i> and
2<i>d.</i> One young man that had been lucky in winning
the ornaments got cleaned out, and staked
his ornaments for 2<i>d.</i>, or for a 1<i>d.</i> rather than not
play. That sort of thing only happened to me
once, to the same extent. If the landlord came
into the room, of course they was only playing for
drink, or he might have begun about his licence.”</p>

<p>The ornaments are bought at the swag shops I
have described, and are nearly all of German
make. They are retailed from 1<i>d.</i> and sometimes
&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> each, and the profit is from 25 to 75 per
cent. There are, I am informed, about thirty
persons in this trade, two-thirds of them being
rafflers, and their receipts being from 25<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>
weekly. Most of them mix “fancy glass” goods
and spars, and other articles, with their “ornament”
trade, so that it is not easy to ascertain
what is expended upon the china ornaments independently
of other wares. If we calculate it at
10<i>s.</i> weekly (a low average considering the success
of some of the raffles), we find 780<i>l.</i> expended
in the streets in these ornamental productions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Textile Fabrics.</span></h3>

<p>These street-folk present perhaps as great a diversity
of character as any of which I have been
called upon to treat.</p>

<p>Among them are the strong persevering men,
who carry rolls of linen or cotton manufacture in
packs on their backs, and trudge along holding a
yard-wand by the middle, which&mdash;it is a not uncommon
joke against them&mdash;is always worn down
an inch or two, by being used as a walking-stick
in their long pedestrian journeys. Such, however,
is not the case, for the packman&mdash;when measuring
is resorted to&mdash;generally shows the justice of his
measure, or invites the purchaser to use her own
yard-wand (for women are now their most frequent
customers). Some of these men love to tell
of the many hundreds of miles they have walked in
their time, and in the three kingdoms. The most
of those who make London, or any large town their
head-quarters, and take regular journeys into the
country, are licensed hawkers; those who confine
their sales exclusively to London and its immediate
vicinity, frequently conduct their business without
incurring the annual cost of a licence. The penalty
for hawking without a licence is 10<i>l.</i>, or an
imprisonment (in default of payment) not exceeding
three months, with a discretionary power of
mitigation to the magistrates. Some of these men
may be styled hereditary hawkers, having first
accompanied and then succeeded their parents on
a round; some were in their youth assistants to
hawkers; some had been unsuccessful as tallymen
when shopkeepers, or travellers for tally-shops,
and have resorted to hawking or street-trading,
occasionally, in their transactions with different
parties, blending the tally system with the simple
rules of sale for ready money.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to these sturdy and often
astute traders are the street-sellers of lace and
millinery, the majority of whom are women. A
walk through a street-market, especially on a
Saturday evening, will show any one the frequent
difference of the established street-milliner to the
other female traders surrounding her stall. The
milliner, as she is commonly called by the street-folk,
wears a clean, and often tasty cap, beneath
her closely-fitting bonnet, a cap in which artificial
flowers are not wanting, should she sell those
adornments. Her shawl is pinned beneath her
collar; her gown, if it be old or of poor material,
is clean; and she is rarely to be seen in boots
or shoes made for men’s wear. Near her stall are
stout, coarse-looking Irish girls, with unstringed
bonnets, half-ragged shawls, thrown loose round
their shoulders, necks red from exposure to the
weather, coarse and never brushed, but sometimes
scraped, shoes, when shoes are worn, and a general
dirtiness of apparel. The street-milliners have
been ladies’-maids, working milliners and dress-makers,
the wives of mechanics who have been
driven to the streets, and who add to the means
of the family by conducting a street-trade themselves,
with a sprinkling from other classes.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of lace are of the same class
as the milliners, but with perhaps less smartness,
and carrying on an inferior trade both as regards
profit and display.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of boot and stay-laces and of
such things as sewing cotton, threads and tapes,
when sold separately from more valuable articles, are
children and old people, some of whom are infirm,
and some blind. The children have, in some instances,
been bred to the streets; the old people
probably are worn out in street-trades requiring
health and strength, and so adopt a less laborious
calling, or else they have been driven to it, either
from comparatively better circumstances, or by
some privation or affliction, in order to avoid the
workhouse.</p>

<p>The sale of belts, stockings, braces, straps and
garters, is mostly in the hands of men, who, from
all that I can learn, are regular street-sellers, who
“turn their hands first to this and then to that,”
but this portion of street-traffic is often combined
with the sale of dog-collars, chains, &amp;c. The trade
is more a public-house than a distinct traffic in
the street. The landlord of a well-frequented inn
in Lambeth told me that every day at least 100 of
such street-sellers&mdash;not including match-girls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
women&mdash;entered his house to offer their wares;
the greatest number of such sellers was in the
evening.</p>

<p>I have so far described what may be called the
fair traders, but to them the street-sellers of textile
fabrics are not confined. There are besides these,
two other classes known as “Duffers” and as “Lumpers,”
and sometimes the same man is both “Duffer”
and “Lumper.” The two names are often confounded,
but an intelligent street-seller, versed in
all the arts and mysteries of this trade, told me that
he understood by a “Duffer,” a man who sold goods
under false pretences, making out that they were
smuggled, or even stolen, so as to enhance the idea
of their cheapness; whereas a “Lumper” would
sell linens, cottons, or silks, which might be really
the commodities represented; but which, by some
management or other, were made to appear new
when they were old, or solid when they were
flimsy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Haberdashery Swag-Shops.</span></h3>

<p>By this name the street-sellers have long distinguished
the warehouses, or rather shops, where
they purchase their goods. The term <i>Swag</i>, or
<i>Swack</i>, or <i>Sweg</i>, is, as was before stated, a Scotch
word, meaning a large collection, a “lot.” The
haberdashery, however, supplied by these establishments
is of a very miscellaneous character;
which, perhaps, can best be shown by describing
a “haberdashery swag,” to which a street-seller,
who made his purchases there, conducted me, and
which, he informed me, was one of the most frequented
by his fraternity, if not <i>the</i> most frequented,
in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The window was neither dingy, nor, as my
companion expressed it, “gay.” It was in size,
as well as in “dressing,” or “show”&mdash;for I heard
the arrangement of the window goods called by
both those names by street people&mdash;half-way
between the quiet plainness of a really wholesale
warehouse, and the gorgeousness of a retail drapery
concern, when a “tremendous sacrifice” befools the
public. Not a quarter of an inch of space was
lost, and the announcements and prices were
written many of them in a bungling school-boy-like
hand, while others were the work of a professional
“ticket writer,” and show the eagerness
of so many of this class of trade to obtain custom.
In one corner was this announcement: “To boot-makers.
Boot fronts cut to any size or quality.”
There was neither boot nor shoe visible, but how
a boot front <i>can be</i> cut “to any quality,” is beyond
my trade knowledge. Half hidden, and read
through laces, was another announcement, sufficiently
odd, in a window decorated with a variety
of combustible commodities: “Hawkers supplied
with fuzees cheaper than any house in London.” On
the “ledge,” or the part shelving from the bottom
of the window, within the shop, were paper boxes
of steel purses with the price marked so loosely
as to leave it an open question whether 1<i>s.</i> 0&frac34;<i>d.</i>
or 10&frac34;<i>d.</i> was the cost. There was also a good store
of silk purses, marked 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>; bright-coloured
ribbons, in a paper box, and done up in small rolls,
1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; cotton reels, four a penny; worsted balls,
three a penny; girls’ night-caps, 1&frac34;<i>d.</i>; women’s
caps, from 2&frac34;<i>d.</i> to 7&frac34;<i>d.</i>; (the &frac34;<i>d.</i> was always in
small indistinct characters, but it was a very favourite
adjunct); diamond patent mixed pins&mdash;London
and Birmingham&mdash;1<i>d.</i> an oz. My companion
directed my attention to the little packets of pins:
“They’re well done up, sir, as you can see, and
in very good and thick and strong pink papers,
with ornamental printers’ borders, and plenty of
paper for three ounces. The paper’s weighed with
the pins, and the price is 1<i>d.</i> an oz.; so the paper
fetches 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a pound.” There were also many
papers of combs, and one tied outside the packet
as a specimen, without a price marked upon them.
“The price varies, sir;” said my guide and informant,
and I heard the same account from others;
“it varies from 1<i>d.</i> a pair to such as me; up to
6<i>d.</i> or perhaps 1<i>s.</i> to a servant-maid what looks
innocent.”</p>

<p>From what appeared to be slender rods fitted
higher up to the breadth of the window depended
“black lace handkerchiefs, 4&frac34;<i>d.</i>;” and cap fronts,
some being a round wreath of gauze ornamented
with light rose-coloured artificial flowers, and
marked “only 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>;” together with lace (or
edgings) which hung in festoons, and filled every
vacancy. Higher up were braces marked 5<i>d.</i>;
and more lace; and to the back of all was a sort
of screen&mdash;for it shuts out all view of the inside of
the shop&mdash;of big-figured shawls (the figures in
purple, orange, and crimson) and of silk handkerchiefs:
“They’re regular duffers,” I was told,
“and very tidy duffers too&mdash;very, for it’s a respectable
house.”</p>

<p>In the centre of the window ledge was a handsome
wreath of artificial flowers, marked 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>
“If a young woman was to go in to buy it at
2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, I’ve seen it myself, sir,” said the street-seller
“she’s told that the ticket has got out of
its place, for it belonged to the lace beneath, but
as she’d made a mistake without thinking of the
value, the flowers was 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to her, though they
was cheap at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>From this account it will be seen that the swag
or wholesale haberdashers are now very general
traders; and that they trade “retail” as well as
“wholesale.” Twenty or twenty-five years ago,
I am informed, the greater part of these establishments
were really haberdashery swags; but so
fierce became the competition in the trade, so keen
the desire “to do business,” that gradually, and
more especially within these four or five years,
they became “all kinds of swags.”</p>

<p>A highly respectable draper told me that he
never could thoroughly understand where hosiery,
haberdashery, or drapery, began or ended; for
hosiers now were always glovers, and often shirt-makers;
haberdashers were always hosiers (at
the least), and drapers were everything; so that
the change in the character of the shops from
which the street-sellers of textile fabrics procure
their supplies, is but in accordance with the change
in the general drapery trade. The literal meaning
of the word haberdashery is unknown to
etymologists.</p>

<p>There are now about fifty haberdashery swags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
resorted to by street-sellers, but only a fifth part
of them make the trade to street-sellers a principal,
while none make it a sole feature of their
business. In the enumeration of the fifty haberdashery
“swags,” five are large and handsome
shops carried on by “cutting” drapers. Some of
these&mdash;one in the borough, especially&mdash;do not
“serve” the street-sellers, except at certain hours,
generally from four to six.</p>

<p>There is another description of shops from
which a class of street traders derive their supplies
of stock. These are the “print-brokers,”
who sell “gown-pieces” to the hawkers or street-traders.
Only about a dozen of such shops, and
those principally in the borough and in Wormwood-street,
Bishopsgate, are frequented by the
London street-sellers. One man showed me a
draper’s shop, at which hawkers were “supplied,”
but without an announcement of such a thing, as
it might affect the character of the concern for
gentility. The gown-pieces were rolled loosely
together, and to each was attached a ticket,
2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, with intermediate prices, but
those here mentioned were the most frequent. The
11<i>d.</i> was in pencil, so that it could be altered at
any time, without the expense of a new ticket
being incurred. “That one marked 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>,”
said the street-seller, “would be charged to me
2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, and the 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> in the same way 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>,
or I might get it at 3<i>s.</i> If those gown-pieces don’t
take&mdash;and they are almost as thin as silver-paper,&mdash;they’ll
be marked down to 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>,
just by degrees, as you see them shown in the
window.” The regular “print-brokers” make no
display in their windows or premises.</p>

<p>The “duffers” and “lumpers” are supplied almost
entirely at one shop in the east end. The proprietor
has the sham, or inferior, silk handkerchiefs
manufactured for the purpose; and for the supply
of his other silk-goods, he purchases any silk
“miscoloured” in the dyeing, or faded from time.
“A faded lavender,” one of his customers told
me, “he’ll get dyed black, and made to look
quite new and fresh. Sometimes it’s good silk,
but it’s mostly very dicky.” This tradesman is
also a retailer.</p>

<p>Such things as braces and garters are sold to
the street people at the general as well as the
haberdashery swag-shops; and are more frequently
sold wholesale than other goods; indeed the
general swag-shop keepers sell them by no other
way; but the “wholesale haberdashers” will sell a
single pair, though not, of course, at wholesale
price. Some houses again supply the more petty
street-sellers, solely with such articles as are
known in Manchester by the name of small-ware,
including thread, cotton, tapes, laces, &amp;c.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Hawkers, Pedlars, and Petty Chapmen.</span></h3>

<p>The machinery for the distribution of commodities
has, in this and in all other “progressive” countries,
necessarily undergone many changes; but
whether these changes have been beneficial to the
community, or not, this is not the place for me to
inquire; all I have to do here is to set forth the order
of such changes, and to show the position that the
hawker and pedlar formerly occupied in the state.</p>

<p>The “distributor” of the produce of the country
is necessarily a kind of go-between, or middleman,
introduced for the convenience of bringing together
the producer and consumer&mdash;the seller and the
buyer of commodities. The producer of a particular
commodity being generally distinct from
the consumer, it follows, that either the commodity
must be carried to the consumer, or the consumer
go to the commodity. To save time and trouble
to both parties, it seems to have been originally
arranged that producer and consumer should meet,
periodically, at appointed places. Such periodical
meetings of buyers and sellers still exist in this
and many other countries, and are termed either
fairs or markets, according as they are held at long
or short intervals&mdash;the fair being generally an
annual meeting, and the market a weekly one.
In the olden time the peculiar characteristic of
these commercial congregations was, that the producer
and consumer came into immediate contact,
without the intervention of any middleman. The
fair or market seemed to be a compromise between
the two, as to the inconvenience of either finding
the other when wanted. The producer brought
his goods, so to speak, half way to the consumer,
while the consumer travelled half way to the
goods. “There would be a great waste of time
and trouble,” says Stewart Mill, “and an inconvenience
often amounting to impracticability, if
consumers could only obtain the article they want
by treating directly with the producers. Both
producers and consumers are too much scattered,
and the latter often at too great a distance from
the former.”</p>

<p>“To diminish this loss of time and labour,”
continues Mr. Mill, “the contrivance of fairs and
markets was early had recourse to, where consumers
and producers might periodically meet,
without any intermediate agency; and this plan
still answers tolerably well for many articles, especially
agricultural produce&mdash;agriculturists having
at some seasons a certain quantity of spare time on
their hands. But even in this case, attendance is
often very troublesome and inconvenient to buyers
who have other occupations, and do not live in the
immediate vicinity; while, for all articles the production
of which requires continuous attention
from the producers, these periodical markets must
be held at such considerable intervals, and the
wants of the consumers must either be provided
for so long beforehand, or must remain so long
unsupplied, that even before the resources of
society permitted the establishment of shops, the
supply of those wants fell universally into the
hands of <i>itinerant dealers</i>, the pedlars who
might appear once a month, being preferred to the
fair, which only returned once a year. In country
districts, remote from towns or large villages, the
vocation of the pedlar is not yet wholly superseded.
But a dealer who has a fixed abode, and fixed
customers,” continues Mr. Mill, “is so much more
to be depended on, that customers prefer resorting
to him, if he is conveniently accessible; and
dealers, therefore, find their advantage in esta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>blishing
themselves in every locality where there
are sufficient consumers near at hand to afford
them remuneration.”</p>

<p>Thus we see that the pedlar was the original
distributor of the produce of the country&mdash;the
primitive middleman, as well as the prime mover
in extending the markets of particular localities, or
for particular commodities. He was, as it were,
the first “free-trader;” increasing the facilities for
the interchange of commodities, without regard to
market dues or tolls, and carrying the natural
advantages of particular districts to remote and
less favoured places; thus enabling each locality
to produce that special commodity for which it
had the greatest natural convenience, and exchanging
it for the peculiar produce of other parts.</p>

<p>Now, this extension of the markets necessarily
involved some machinery for the conveyance of the
goods from one district to another. Hence, the pedlar
was not only the original merchant, but the primitive
carrier&mdash;to whom, perhaps, we owe both our
turnpike-roads and railways. For, since the peculiar
characteristic of the pedlar was the carrying the
produce to the consumer, rather than troubling the
consumer to go after the produce, of course it soon
became necessary, as the practice increased, and increased
quantities of goods had to be conveyed
from one part of the country to another, that
increased facilities of transit should be effected.
The first change was from the pack-<i>man</i> to the
pack-<i>horse</i>: for the former a foot-way alone was required;
while the latter necessitated the formation
of some kind of a road. Some of these ancient
pack-horse roads existed till within these few
years. Hagbush-lane, which was described by
William Hone only twenty years ago, but which
has now vanished, was the ancient bridle or pack-horse
road from London to the North, and extended
by the Holloway back road as far as the
City-road, near Old-street. “Some parts of Hagbush-lane,”
says Hone, “are much lower than the
meadows on either side.” At one time a terraced
ridge, at another a deep rut, the pack-horse road
must have been to the unaccustomed traveller a
somewhat perilous pass. The historian of Craven,
speaking of 1609, says, “At this time the communication
between the north of England and the
Universities was kept up by the carriers, who pursued
their long but uniform route with trains of
pack-horses. To their care were consigned packages,
and not unfrequently the persons of young
scholars. It was through their medium, also, that
epistolary correspondence was managed; and as
they always visited London, a letter could scarcely
be exchanged between Yorkshire and Oxford in
less time than a month.” The General Post Office
was established by Act of Parliament in the year
1660, and all letters were to be sent through this
office, “except such letters as shall be sent by
coaches, common-known carriers of goods by carts,
waggons, and pack-horses, and shall be carried
along with their carts, waggons, and pack-horses
respectively.”</p>

<p>“There is no such conveyance as a waggon in
this country” (Scotland), says Roderick Random,
referring to the beginning of the last century,
“and my finances were too weak to support the
expense of hiring a horse. I determined therefore
to set out with the carriers, who transport goods
from one place to another on horseback; and this
scheme I accordingly put in execution on the 1st
day of November, 1739, sitting on a pack-saddle
between two baskets, one of which contained my
goods in a knapsack. But by the time we arrived
at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I was so fatigued with
the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed
with the coldness of the weather, that I resolved
to travel the rest of my journey on foot, rather
than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.”</p>

<p>The present mode of travelling, compared with
that of the pack-horse means of conveyance as
pursued of old, forms one of the most striking
contrasts, perhaps, in all history.</p>

<p>Hence we see that the pedlar was originally
both carrier and seller; first conveying his pack
on his back, and then, as it increased in bulk,
transferring it to the back of “the pack-horse.”
But as soon as the practice of conveying the commodities
to the buyers, instead of compelling the
buyers to go to the commodities, was found to be
advantageous to both consumer and producer, it
was deemed expedient that the two distinct processes
of carriage and sale, which are included in
the distribution of commodities, should be conducted
by distinct persons, and hence the carrying and
selling of goods became separate vocations in the
State; and such is now the machinery by which the
commodities of different parts of this country, as
well as of others, are at present diffused over the
greater portion of this kingdom. In remote districts
however, and the poorer neighbourhoods of large
towns, where there are either too few consumers, or
too few commodities required now to support a fixed
distributor with a distinct apparatus of transit, the
pedlar still continues to be the sole means of diffusing
the produce of one locality among the inhabitants
of another; and it is in this light&mdash;as
the poor man’s merchant&mdash;that we must here consider
him.</p>

<p>Among the more ancient of the trades, then,
carried on in England is that of the hawker or
pedlar. It is generally considered, as I said before,
that hawking “is as ancient a mode of trade
as that carried on in fairs and markets, towns and
villages, as well as at the castles of the nobles or
the cottages of their retainers.” To fix the origin
of fairs is impossible, for, in ancient and mediæval
times, every great gathering was necessarily a fair.
Men&mdash;whom it is no violence to language to call
“hawkers”&mdash;resorted alike to the Olympic games
and to the festivals of the early Christian saints,
to sell or barter their wares. Of our English fairs
Mr. Jacob says, in his “Law Dictionary”&mdash;“Various
privileges have been annexed to them,
and numerous facilities afforded to the disposal of
property in them. To give them a greater degree
of solemnity, they were originally, both in the
ancient and modern world, associated with religious
festivals. In most places, indeed, they are
still held on the same day with the wake or feast
of the saint to whom the church is dedicated; and
till the practice was prohibited, it was customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
in England to hold them in churchyards. This
practice, I may add, was not fully prohibited until
the reign of Charles II., although it had long
before fallen into disuse. Thus the connection
between church and market is shown to be of venerable
antiquity.”</p>

<p>The hawker dealt, in the old times, more in
textile fabrics than in anything else. Indeed,
Shakspere has dashed off a catalogue of his
wares, in the song of <i>Autolycus</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Lawn as white as driven snow,</div>
       <div class="verse">Cyprus black as e’er was crow.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the reigns succeeding the termination of the
Wars of the Roses, and down to the Commonwealth,
the hawker’s pack was often stocked with
costly goods; for great magnificence in dress was
then the custom of the wealthy, and even the
burgesses on public occasions wore velvet, fine
cambric ruffs, and furs. The hawker was thus
often a man of substance and frequently travelled
on horseback, with his wares slung in bags on his
horse’s side, or fitted to the crupper or pommell of
his saddle. He was often, moreover, attended by
a man, both for help in his sales, and protection
in travelling. In process of time an established
hawker became the medium of news and of gossip,
and frequently the bearer of communications from
town to town. His profits were often great, but
no little trust seems to have been reposed in him
as to the quality and price of his goods; and, until
the present century or so, slop goods were little
manufactured, so that he could not so well practise
deceptions. Neither, during the prosperity of
the trade, does it appear that any great degree of
dishonesty characterized the hawker, though to
this there were of course plenty of minor exceptions
as well as one glaring contradiction.
The wreckers of our southern coasts, who sometimes
became possessed of rich silks, velvets,
laces, &amp;c.&mdash;(not unfrequently murdering all the
mariners cast on shore, and there was a convenient
superstition among the wreckers, that it
was unlucky to offer help to a drowning man)&mdash;disposed
of much of their plunder to the
hawkers; and as communication was slow, even
down to Mr. Palmer’s improvements in the Post
Office in 1784, the goods thus rescued from the
deep, or obtained by the murder of the mariners,
were disposed of even before the loss of the vessel
was known at her destination; for we are told
that there was generally a hawker awaiting a
wreck on the most dangerous shores of Cornwall,
Devon, Dorset, and Sussex.</p>

<p>During the last century, and for the first ten
years of the present, the hawker’s was a profitable
calling. He usually in later times travelled with
horse and covered cart, visiting fairs, markets, and
private houses, more especially in the country. In
some parts the calling was somewhat hereditary,
son succeeding to father after having officiated as his
assistant, and so becoming known to the customers.
The most successful of the class, alike on both
sides of the border, were Scotchmen.</p>

<p>In 1810 the prosperity of this trade experienced
a check. In that year “every hawker, pedlar, or
petty chapman going from town to town, or to
other men’s houses, and travelling on foot, carrying
to sell or exposing for sale any goods” was required
to pay a yearly licence of 4<i>l.</i>, with an
additional 4<i>l.</i> for every horse, ass, or mule, used
in the business. Nothing, however, in the Act in
question, 50 Geo. III. c. 41, as I have before intimated,
“extended to prohibit” the hawking
for sale of “any fish, fruit, or victuals” without
licence. Neither is there any extension of the
prohibition to the unlicensed workers or makers
of any goods or wares, or their children or servants
resident with them, hawking such goods,
and selling them “in every city, borough, town
corporate, or market town,” but not in villages
or country places. “Tinkers, coopers, glaziers,
plumbers, and harness-menders,” are likewise permitted
to carry about with them the proper materials
necessary for their business, no licence being
necessary.</p>

<p>The passing of this Act did not materially
check the fraudulent practices of which the hawkers
were accused, and of which a portion of them
were doubtlessly guilty; indeed some of the
manufacturers, whose names were pirated by the
hawkers, were of opinion that the licensing for ten
or twenty years facilitated fraud, as many people,
both in London and the country, thought they
were safe in dealing with a “licensed” hawker, since
he could not procure a licence without a certificate
of his good character from the clergyman of
his place of residence, and from two “reputable
inhabitants.” Linen of good quality used to be
extensively hawked, but from 1820 to 1825, or
later in some parts, the hawkers got to deal in an
inferior quality, “unions” (a mixture of linen
and cotton), glazed and stiffened, and set off
with gaudy labels bearing sometimes the name of
a well-known firm, but altered in spelling or otherwise,
and expressed so as to lead to the belief that
such a firm were the manufacturers of the article.
Jews, moreover, as we have seen, travelled in all
parts with inferior watches and jewellery, and
sometimes “did well” by persuading the possessors
of old solid watches, or old seals or jewellery, that
they were ridiculously out of fashion, and so inducing
them to give money along with the old
watch for a watch or other article of the newest
fashion, which yet was intrinsically valueless compared
with the other. These and other practices,
such as selling inferior lace under pretence of its
having been smuggled from France, and of the
choicest quality, tended to bring the hawker’s
trade into disrepute, and the disrepute affected the
honest men in the business. Some sank from
the possession of a good horse and cart to travelling
on foot, as of yore, forwarding goods from place to
place by the common carriers, and some relinquished
the itinerant trade altogether. The
“cutting” and puffing shopkeepers appeared next,
and at once undersold the “slop” hawker, and
foiled him on his own ground of pushing off inferior
wares for the best. The numbers of the hawkers
fell off considerably, but notwithstanding I find,
in the last census tables (1841), the following
returns as to the numbers of “hawkers, hucksters,
and pedlars,” distributed throughout Great Bri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>tain.
The Government returns, however, admit
of no comparison being formed between these
numbers and those of any previous time.</p>

<p>The counties in which the hawkers, hucksters,
and pedlars most abound appear to be&mdash;1st, Lancaster;
2nd, Middlesex; 3rd, Yorkshire (West
Riding); 4th, Lanark; and 5th, Surrey.</p>

<p>What rule, if any rule, was observed in classing
these “hawkers, hucksters, and pedlars,” or what
distinction was drawn between a hawker and a
huckster, I am unable to say, but it is certain
that the number of “licensed hawkers” was within
one-half of the 17,270; for, in 1841, the hawkers’
duty realized only 32,762<i>l.</i> gross revenue, and
waiving the amount paid for the employment of
horses, &amp;c., the official return, reckoning so many
persons paying 4<i>l.</i> each, shows only 8190 licensed
hawkers in 1841.</p>

<p>The hawker’s business has been prosecuted far
more extensively in country than in town, but he
still continues to deal in London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Packmen, or Hawkers of Soft
Wares.</span></h3>

<p>The packman, as he is termed, derives his name
from carrying his merchandise or pack upon his
back. These itinerant distributors are far less
numerous than they were twenty or twenty-five
years since. A few years since, they were mostly
Irishmen, and their principal merchandise, Irish
linens&mdash;a fabric not so generally worn now as it
was formerly.</p>

<p>The packmen are sometimes called Manchester-men.
These are the men whom I have described
as the sellers of shirtings, sheetings, &amp;c. One
man, who was lately an assistant in the trade,
could reckon twenty men who were possessed of
good stocks, good connections, and who had saved
money. They traded in an honourable manner,
were well known, and much respected. The majority
of them were natives of the north of Ireland,
and two had been linen manufacturers. It
is common, indeed, for all the Irishmen in this
trade to represent themselves as having been connected
with the linen manufacture in Belfast.</p>

<p>This trade is now becoming almost entirely a
country trade. There are at present, I am told,
only five pursuing it in London, none of them
having a very extensive connection, so that only a
brief notice is necessary. Their sale is of both
cottons and linens for shirts. They carry them in
rolls of 36 yards, or in smaller rolls, each of a
dozen yards, and purchase them at the haberdashery
swag-shops, at from 9<i>d.</i> to 18<i>d.</i> a yard.
I now speak of good articles. Their profits are
not very large&mdash;as for the dozen yards, which
cost them 9<i>s.</i>, they often have a difficulty in getting
12<i>s.</i>&mdash;while in street-sale, or in hawking
from house to house, there is great delay. A well-furnished
pack weighs about one cwt., and so
necessitates frequent stoppages. Cotton, for sheetings,
is sold in the same manner, costing the vendors
from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a yard.</p>

<p>Of the tricks of the trade, and of the tally
system of one of these chapmen, I had the following
account from a man who had been, both as
principal and assistant, a travelling packman, but
was best acquainted with the trade in and about
London.</p>

<p>“My master,” he said, “was an Irishman, and
told everybody he had been a manager of a linen
factory in Belfast. I believe he was brought up
to be a shoemaker, and was never in the north of
Ireland. Anyhow, he was very shy of talking
about Irish factories to Irish gentlemen. I heard
one say to him, ‘Don’t tell me, you have the Cork
brogue.’ I know he’d got some knowledge of
linen weaving at Dundee, and could talk about it
very clever; indeed he was a clever fellow.
Sometimes, to hear him talk, you’d think he was
quite a religious man, and at others that he was a
big blackguard. It wasn’t drink that made the
difference, for he was no drinker. It’s a great
thing on a round to get a man or woman into a
cheerful talk, and put in a joke or two; and that
he could do, to rights. I had 12<i>s.</i> a week, standing
wages, from him, and bits of commissions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
sales that brought me from 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> more. He
was a buyer of damaged goods, and we used to
‘doctor’ them. In some there was perhaps damages
by two or three threads being out all the
way, so the manufacturers wouldn’t send them
to their regular customers. My master pretended
it was a secret where he got them, but, lord, I
knew; it was at a swag-shop. We used to cut up
these in twelves (twelve yards), sometimes less if
they was very bad, and take a Congreve, and just
scorch them here and there, where the flaws was
worst, and plaster over other flaws with a little
flour and dust, to look like a stain from street
water from the fire-engine. Then they were from
the stock of Mr. Anybody, the great draper, that
had his premises burnt down&mdash;in Manchester or
Glasgow, or London&mdash;if there’d been a good fire at
a draper’s&mdash;or anywhere; we wasn’t particular.
They was fine or strong shirtings, he’d say&mdash;and
so they was, the sound parts of them&mdash;and he’d sell
as cheap as common calico. I’ve heard him say,
‘Why, marm, sure marm, with your eyes and
scissors and needle, them burns&mdash;ah! fire’s a dreadful
judgment on a man&mdash;isn’t the least morsel of
matter in life. The stains is cured in a wash-tub
in no time. It’s only <i>touched</i> by the fire, and
you can humour it, I know, in cutting out as a
shirt ought to be cut; it should be as carefully
done as a coat.’ Then we had an Irish linen, an
imitation, you know, a kind of ‘Union,’ which we
call double twist. It is made, I believe, in
Manchester, and is a mixture of linen and cotton.
Some of it’s so good that it takes a judge to tell
the difference between it and real Irish. He got
some beautiful stuff at one time, and once sold to
a fine-dressed young woman in Brompton, a dozen
yards, at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a yard, and the dozen only cost
him 14<i>s.</i> Then we did something on tally, but
he was dropping that trade. The shopkeepers
undersold him. ‘If you get 60<i>l.</i> out of 100<i>l.</i>, in
tally scores,’ he often said, ‘it’s good money, and
a fair living profit;’ but he got far more than that.
What was worth 8<i>s.</i> was 18<i>s.</i> on tally, pay 1<i>s.</i> a
week. He did most that way with the masters of
coffee-shops and the landlords of little public-houses.
Sometimes, if they couldn’t pay, we’d
have dinner, and that went to account, and he’d
quarrel with me after it for what was my share.
There’s not much of this sort of trade now, sir.
I believe my old master got his money together
and emigrated.”</p>

<p>“Do you want any ginuine Irish linin, ma’am?”
uttered in unmistakable brogue, seemed to authenticate
the fact, that the inquirer (being an
Irishman) in all likelihood possessed the legitimate
article; but as to their obtaining their goods from
Coleraine and other places in the Emerald Isle,
famed for the manufacture of linen, it was and
is as pure fiction as the Travels of Baron Munchausen.</p>

<p>The majority of these packmen have discontinued
dealing in linens exclusively, and have
added silks, ladies’ dresses, shawls and various
articles connected with the drapery business. The
country, and small towns and villages, remote
from the neighbourhood of large and showy shops,
are the likeliest markets for the sale of their
goods. In London the Irish packmen have been
completely driven out by the Scotch tallymen,
who indeed are the only class of packmen likely to
succeed in London. If the persevering Scotch
tallyman can but set foot in a decent-looking
residence, and be permitted to display his tempting
finery to the “lady of the house,” he
generally manages to talk her into purchasing
articles that perhaps she has no great occasion
for, and which serve often to involve her in difficulties
for a considerable period&mdash;causing her no
little perplexity, and requiring much artifice to
keep the tallyman’s weekly visits a secret from
her husband&mdash;to say nothing of paying an enormous
price for the goods; for the many risks
which the tallyman incurs, necessitates of course
an exorbitant rate of profit.</p>

<p>“The number of packmen or hawkers of shawls,
silks, &amp;c., I think” (says one of their own body)
“must have decreased full one-half within the last
few years. The itinerant haberdashery trade is
far from the profitable business that it used to be,
and not unfrequently do I travel a whole day
without taking a shilling: still, perhaps, one day’s
good work will make up for half a dozen bad ones.
All the packmen have hawkers’ licences, as they
have mostly too valuable a stock to incur the risk
of losing it for want of such a privilege. Some of
the fraternity” (says my informant) “do not always
deal ‘upon the square;’ they profess to have just
come from India or China, and to have invested
all their capital in silks of a superior description
manufactured in those countries, and to have got
them on shore ‘unbeknown to the Custom-house
authorities.’ This is told in confidence to
the servant-man or woman who opens the door&mdash;‘be
so good as tell the lady as much,’ says the
hawker, ‘for really I’m afraid to carry the goods
much longer, and I have already sold enough to
pay me well enough for my spec&mdash;go, there’s a
good girl, tell your missus I have splendid goods,
and am willing almost to give them away, and if we
makes a deal of it, why I don’t mind giving you a
handsome present for yourself.’” This is a bait not
to be resisted. Should the salesman succeed with
the mistress, he carries out his promise to the
maid by presenting her with a cap ribbon, or a
cheap neckerchief.</p>

<p>The most primitive kind of packmen, or hawkers
of soft-wares, who still form part of the distributing
machinery of the country, traverse the highlands
of Scotland. They have their regular rounds, and
regular days of visiting their customers; their
arrival is looked for with interest by the country
people; and the inmates of the farm-house where
they locate for the night consider themselves fortunate
in having to entertain the packman; for he
is their newsmonger, their story-teller, their friend,
and their acquaintance, and is always made welcome.
His wares consist of hose&mdash;linsey wolsey,
for making petticoats&mdash;muslins for caps&mdash;ribbons&mdash;an
assortment of needles, pins, and netting-pins&mdash;and
all sorts of small wares. He always travels
on foot. It is suspected that he likewise does
a little in the “jigger line,” for many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Highlanders have, or are supposed to have, their
illicit distilleries; and the packmen are suspected
of trafficking without excise interference. Glasgow,
Dundee, Galashiels, and Harwick are the principal
manufacturing towns where the packman replenishes
his stock. “My own opinion,” says an
informant of considerable experience, “is that
these men seldom grow rich; but the prevailing
idea in the country part of Scotland is, that the
pedlar has an unco lang stockin wi’ an awfu’
amount o goden guineas in it, and that his pocket
buik is plumped out wi’ a thick roll of bank
notes. Indeed there are many instances upon
record of poor packmen having been murdered&mdash;the
assassins, doubtlessly, expecting a rich booty.”
It scarcely ever costs the packman of Scotland
anything for his bed and board. The Highlanders
are a most hospitable people with acquaintances&mdash;although
with strangers at first they are invariably
shy and distant. In Ireland there is also the
travelling pedlar, whose habits and style of doing
business are nearly similar to that of the Scotchman.
Some of the packmen of Scotland have
risen to eminence and distinction. A quondam
lord provost of Glasgow, a gentleman still living,
and upon whom the honour of knighthood has
been conferred, was, according to common report,
in his earlier days a packman; and rumour also
does the gentleman the credit to acknowledge that
he is not ashamed to own it.</p>

<p>I am told by a London hawker of soft goods, or
packman, that the number of his craft, hawking
London and its vicinity, as far as he can judge, is
about 120 (the census of 1841 makes the London
hawkers, hucksters and pedlars amount to 2041).
In the 120 are included the Irish linen hawkers. I
am also informed that the fair trader’s profits amount
to about 20 per cent., while those of the not over-particular
trader range from 80 to 200 per cent.
In a fair way of business it is said the hawker’s
taking will amount, upon an average, to 7<i>l.</i> or 8<i>l.</i>
per week; whereas the receipts of the “duffer,” or
unfair hawker, will sometimes reach to 50<i>l.</i> per
week. Many, however, travel days, and do not
turn a penny.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a Packman.</span></h3>

<p>Of the way of trading of a travelling-pedlar I had
the following account from one of the body. He
was well dressed, and a good but keen-looking
man of about thirty-five, slim, and of rather short
stature, with quick dark eyes and bushy whiskers,
on which it was evident no small culture was
bestowed. His manners were far from obtrusive
or importunate&mdash;to those whom he sought to
make customers&mdash;for I happened to witness a
portion of his proceedings in that respect; but he
had a quiet perseverance with him, which, along
with perfect civility, and something like deference,
might be the most efficient means of recommending
himself to the maid-servants, among whom lay
his chief customers. He showed a little of the
pride of art in describing the management of his
business, but he would not hear that he “pattered:”
he talked to his customers, he declared, as any
draper, who knew his business well, might talk
to <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>When I saw him, his pack, which he carried
slung over one shoulder, contained a few gown-pieces
of printed cotton, nearly all with pink
grounds; a few shawls of different sizes; and
three rolls firmly packed, each with a card-label
on which was neatly written, “French Merino.
Full duty paid. A.B.&mdash;L.F.&mdash;18&mdash;33&mdash;1851.
French Chocolate.” There were also six neat
paper packages, two marked “worked collars,”
three, “gauze handkerchiefs,” and the other
“beautiful child’s gros de naples.” The latter
consisted of 4&frac12; yards of black silk, sufficient for
a child’s dress. He carried with him, moreover,
5 umbrellas, one inclosed in a bright glazed cover,
while from its mother-of-pearl handle hung a card
addressed&mdash;“The Lady’s Maid, Victoria Lodge,
13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>“This is a very small stock,” he said, “to what
I generally carry, but I’m going on a country
round to-morrow, and I want to get through it
before I lay in a new one. I tell people that I
want to sell off my goods cheap, as they’re too
good for country sale; and that’s true, the better
half of it.”</p>

<p>On my expressing some surprise that he should
be leaving London at this particular time, he
<span class="lock">answered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I go into the country because I think all the
hawkers will be making for town, and there’ll be
plenty of customers left in the country, and fewer
to sell to them at their own places. That’s my
opinion.”</p>

<p>“I sell to women of all sorts. Smart-dressing
servant-maids, perhaps, are my best customers,
especially if they live a good way from any grand
ticketing shop. I sold one of my umbrellas to one
of them just before you spoke to me. She was
standing at the door, and I saw her give half a
glance at the umbrellas, and so I offered them.
She first agreed to buy a very nice one at 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
(which should have been 4<i>s.</i>), but I persuaded her
to take one at 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> (which should have been
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>). ‘Look here, ma’am,’ said I, ‘this
umbrella is much bigger you see, and will carry
double, so when you’re coming from church of a
wet Sunday evening, a friend can have share of
it, and very grateful he’ll be, as he’s sure to have
his best hat on. There’s been many a question
put under an umbrella that way that’s made a
young lady blush, and take good care of her umbrella
when she was married, and had a house
of her own. I look sharp after the young and
pretty ladies, Miss, and shall as long as I’m a
bachelor.’ ‘O,’ says she, ‘such ridiculous nonsense because
it’s often so windy about here, and then
one must have a good cover if it rains as well.’</p>

<p>“That’s my way, sir. I don’t mind telling
that, because they do the same in the shops. I’ve
heard them, but they can’t put love and sweet-hearting
so cleverly in a crowded shop as we can
in a quiet house. It’s that I go for, love and
sweet-hearting; and I always speak to any smart
servant as if I thought she was the mistress, or as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
if I wasn’t sure whether she was the mistress or
the lady’s-maid; three times out of four she’s
house-maid or maid of all work. I call her ‘ma’am,’
and ‘young lady,’ and sometimes ‘miss.’ It’s no
use offering to sell until a maid has tidied herself
in the afternoon&mdash;not a bit. I should make a capital
draper’s shopman, I know, only I could never
bear the confinement. I never will hear such
words as ‘I don’t want it,’ or, ‘nothing more
to-day,’ no more than if I was behind a counter.</p>

<p>“The great difficulty I have is to get a chance
of offering my goods. If I ring at a gate&mdash;for I
always go a little way out of town&mdash;they can see
who it is, and I may ring half an hour for nothing.
If the door’s opened it’s often shut again directly,
and I just hear ‘bother.’ I used to leave a few
bills, and I do so still in some parts of the country,
with a list of goods, and ‘this bill to be called for’
printed at the bottom. But I haven’t done that
in town for a long time; it’s no good. People
seem to think it’s giving double trouble. One
of the prettiest girls I ever saw where I called one
evening, pointed&mdash;just as I began to say, ‘I left a
bill and’&mdash;to some paper round a candle in a
stick, and shut the door laughing.</p>

<p>“In selling my gown-pieces I say they are such
as will suit the complexion, and such like; and I
always use my judgment in saying so. Why
shouldn’t I? It’s the same to me what colour I
sell. ‘It’s a genteel thing, ma’am,’ I’ll say to a
servant-maid, ‘and such as common people won’t
admire. It’s not staring enough for them. I’m
sure it would become you, ma’am, and is very
cheap; cheaper than you could buy at a shop; for
all these things are made by the same manufacturers,
and sold to the wholesale dealers at the same price,
and a shopkeeper, you know, has his young men,
and taxes, and rates, and gas, and fine windows to
pay for, and I haven’t, so it don’t want much judgment
to see that I must be able to sell cheaper
than shopkeepers, and I think your own taste,
ma’am, will satisfy you that these here are elegant
patterns.’</p>

<p>“That’s the way I go on. No doubt there’s
others do the same, but I know and care little
about them. I have my own way of doing business,
and never trouble myself about other people’s
patter or nonsense.</p>

<p>“Now, that piece of silk I shall, most likely,
sell to the landlady of a public-house, where I see
there’s children. I shall offer it after I’ve got a
bit of dinner there, or when I’ve said I want a
bit. It’s no use offering it there, though, if it isn’t
cheap; they’re too good judges. Innkeepers
aren’t bad customers, I think, taking it altogether,
to such as me, if you can get to talk to
them, as you sometimes can at their bars. They’re
generally wanting something, that’s one step. I
always tell them that they ought to buy of men,
in my way, who live among them, and not of fine
shop-keepers, who never came a-near their houses.
I’ve sold them both cottons and linens, after such
talk as that. I live at public-houses in the
country. I sleep nowhere else.</p>

<p>“My trade in town is nothing to what it was
ten or a dozen years back. I don’t know the
reason exactly. I think so many threepenny
busses is one; for they’ll take any servant, when
she’s got an afternoon, to a thoroughfare full of
ticket-shops, and bring her back, and her bundle
of purchases too, for another 3<i>d.</i> I shall cut it altogether,
I think, and stick to the country. Why,
I’ve known the time when I should have met from
half-a-dozen to a dozen people trading in my way
in town, and for these three days, and dry days too,
I haven’t met one. My way of trading in the
country is just the same as in town. I go from
farm-house to farm-house, or call at gentlemen’s
grand seats&mdash;if a man’s known to the servants
there, it may be the best card he can play&mdash;and I
call at every likely house in the towns or villages.
I only go to a house and sell a mistress or
maid the same sort of goods (a little cheaper,
perhaps), and recommend them in the same way,
as is done every day at many a fine city, and
borough, and West-End shop. I never say they’re
part of a bankrupt’s stock; a packfull would seem
nothing for that. I never pretend that they’re
smuggled. Mine’s a respectable trade, sir. There’s
been so much dodging that way, it’s been a great
stop to fair trading; and I like to go on the same
round more than once. A person once taken-in by
smuggled handkerchiefs, or anything, won’t deal
with a hawker again, even though there’s no
deception. But ‘duffing,’ and all that is going
down fast, and I wish it was gone altogether. I
do nothing in tally. I buy my goods; and I’ve
bought all sorts, in wholesale houses, of course,
and I’d rather lay out 10<i>l.</i> in Manchester than
in London. O, as to what I make, I can’t say it’s
enough to keep me (I’ve only myself), and escape
the income-tax. Sometimes I make 10<i>s.</i> a week;
sometimes 20<i>s.</i>; sometimes 30<i>s.</i>; and I have made
50<i>s.</i>; and one week, the best I ever did, I made
as much as 74<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> That’s all I can say.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be sufficiently accurate to compute
the average weekly earnings of a smart
trader like my informant, at from 21<i>s.</i> to 25<i>s.</i>
in London, and from 25<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> in the country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Tally Packman.</span></h3>

<p>The pedlar tallyman is a hawker who supplies
his customers with goods, receiving payment by
weekly instalments, and derives his name from
the tally or score he keeps with his customers.
Linen drapery&mdash;or at least the general routine
of linen-draper’s stock, as silk-mercery, hosiery,
woollen cloths, &amp;c.&mdash;is the most prevalent trade
of the tallyman. There are a few shoemakers and
some household furniture dealers who do business
in the tally or “score” system; but the great
majority are linen-drapers, though some of them
sell household furniture as well. The system is
generally condemned as a bad one; as leading
to improvidence in the buyer and rapacity in the
seller. There are many who have incurred a tally
debt, and have never been able to “get a-head of
it,” but have been kept poor by it all their lives.
Some few, however, may have been benefited by
the system, and as an outfit for a young man or
woman entering service is necessary&mdash;when the
parties are too poor to pay ready money&mdash;it is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
accommodation. I have never heard any of the
tallyman’s customers express an opinion upon the
subject, other than that they wish they had done
with the tallyman, or could do without him.</p>

<p>The system does not prevail to so great an
extent as it did some years back. The pedlar or
hawking tallyman travels for orders, and consequently
is said not to require a hawker’s licence.
The great majority of the tally-packmen are
Scotchmen. The children who are set to watch
the arrival of the tallyman, and apprise the mother
of his approach, when not convenient to pay,
whisper instead of “Mother, here’s the Tallyman,”
“Mother, here’s the Scotchman.” These men live
in private houses, which they term their warehouse;
they are many of them proprietors themselves
in a small way, and conduct the whole of
their business unassisted. Their mode of doing
business is as follows:&mdash;they seldom knock at a
door except they have a customer upon whom
they call for the weekly instalment, but if a respectable-looking
female happens to be standing at
her door, she, in all probability, is accosted by the
Scotchman, “Do you require anything in my
way to-day, ma’am?” This is often spoken in
broad Scotch, the speaker trying to make it sound
as much like English as possible. Without waiting
for a reply, he then runs over a programme of the
treasures he has to dispose of, emphasising all those
articles which he considers likely to suit the taste of
the person he addresses. She doesn’t want perhaps
any&mdash;she has no money to spare then. “She may
want something in his way another day, may-be,”
says the tallyman. “Will she grant him permission
to exhibit some beautiful shawls&mdash;the last new
fashion? or some new style of dress, just out, and
an extraordinary bargain?” The man’s importunities,
and the curiosity of the lady, introduces
him into the apartment,&mdash;an acquaintance is called
in to pass her opinion upon the tallyman’s stock.
Should she still demur, he says, “O, I’m sure
your husband cannot object&mdash;he will not be so
unreasonable; besides, consider the easy mode of
payment, you’ll only have to pay 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week
for every pound’s worth of goods you take; why
it’s like nothing; you possess yourself of respectable
clothing and pay for them in such an easy
manner that you never miss it; well, I’ll call next
week. I shall leave you this paper.” The paper
left is a blank form to be filled up by the husband,
and runs thus:&mdash;“I agree on behalf of my wife
to pay, by weekly instalments of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> upon
every pound’s worth of good she may purchase.”
This proceeding is considered necessary by the
tallymen, as the judges in the Court of Requests
now so frequently decide against him, where the
husband is not cognisant of the transaction.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, and the
question having been asked what business the
husband is&mdash;where he works&mdash;and (if it can be
done without offence) what are his wages? The
Scotchman takes stock of the furniture, &amp;c.; the
value of what the room contains gives him a sufficiently
correct estimate of the circumstances of his
customers. His next visit is to the nearest chandler’s
shop, and there as blandly as possible he inquires
into the credit, &amp;c., of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. If he deal, however,
with the chandler, the tallyman accounts it
a bad omen, as people in easy circumstances seldom
resort to such places. “It is unpleasant to
me,” he says to the chandler, “making these inquiries;
but Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; wishes to open an account
with me, and I should like to oblige them
if I thought my money was safe.” “Do <i>you</i>
trust them, and what sort of payers are they?”
According to the reply&mdash;the tallyman determines
upon his course. But he rarely stops here; he
makes inquiries also at the greengrocer’s, the beer
shop, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The persons who connect themselves with the
tallyman, little know the inquisition they subject
themselves to.</p>

<p>When the tallyman obtains a customer who
pays regularly, he is as importunate for her
to recommend him another customer, as he
originally was to obtain her custom. Some tallymen
who keep shops have “travellers” in
their employ, some of whom have salaries, while
others receive a percentage upon all payments,
and do not suffer any loss upon bad debts. Notwithstanding
the caution of the tallyman, he is
frequently “victimised.” Many pawn the goods
directly they have obtained them, and in some
instances spend the money in drink. Their many
losses, as a matter of course, <i>somebody</i> must
make good. It therefore becomes necessary for
them to charge a higher price for their commodities
than the regular trader.</p>

<p>However charitably inclined the tallyman may
be at first, he soon becomes, I am told, inured to
scenes of misery, while the sole feeling in his mind
at length is, “I will have my money;” for he is
often tricked, and in some cases most impudently
victimised. I am told by a tallyman that he once
supplied goods to the amount of 2<i>l.</i>, and when
he called for the first instalment, the woman said
she didn’t intend to pay, the goods didn’t suit her,
and she would return them. The tallyman expressed
his willingness to receive them back,
whereupon she presented him a pawnbroker’s
duplicate. She had pledged them an hour after
obtaining them. This was done in a court in the
presence of a dozen women, who all chuckled
with delight at the joke.</p>

<p>The principal portion of the tallyman’s customers
are poor mechanics. When the appearance
of the house, and the inquiries out of doors are
approved of, no security is required; but the tallyman
would at all times rather add a security,
when attainable. Servant-girls who deal with
tallymen must find the security of a housekeeper;
and when such housekeeper agrees to be responsible
for the payments, the same inquisitorial proceedings
are adopted, in order to ascertain the
circumstances of the surety. There are about
fifty drapery shops in London where the tally-trade
is carried on; and about 200 Scotchmen,
besides fifty others (part English, part Irish), are
engaged in the trade. A clerk of a tally-shop, at
the West-end, informs me that there are ten collectors
and canvassers for customers, out each day,
from that one establishment; and that, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
lately, they were accustomed to collect moneys on
Sundays. Some collect as much as 12<i>l.</i> or 14<i>l.</i> a
day; and some not more than 2<i>l.</i> or 3<i>l.</i> The
average sum collected may be about 5<i>l.</i> each, or
50<i>l.</i> per day by the whole. The profits are 30
per cent., the bad debts 10 per cent., thus leaving
20 per cent. net.</p>

<p>The Scotchman who does not choose to extend
his business beyond his own cautious superintendence,
is content with smaller profits, perhaps
20 per cent., and his bad debts may be estimated
at 2&frac12; per cent. One of the body informed me
that he had been in the tally-trade about five
years; that he commenced with a capital of only
10<i>l.</i>, and that now his collections average 30<i>l.</i> per
week. He never bought, he said, on credit; and
his stock on hand is worth nearly 200<i>l.</i> cost price,
while his outstanding debts are nearly 200<i>l.</i> also.
“This is a flourishing state of affairs,” he remarked;
“I do not owe a penny in the world,
and I have accomplished all this in little less than
five years.” This man had served his apprenticeship
to a draper in Glasgow, and had originally
arrived in London with 20<i>l.</i> in his pocket. After
some weeks’ fruitless endeavour to obtain a situation,
his money dwindling away the while, he
was advised, by a fellow-countryman, who was a
tallyman, to try the tally-trade. For a few days
previous to adopting the business, he went the
“rounds” with his friend, for the purpose of getting
initiated, and the week after started on
his own account. Notwithstanding his having no
hawker’s licence, he tried to effect sales for ready
money, and, to a trifling extent, succeeded. The
first week he obtained three tally customers. He
could have got, he said, a dozen; but he selected
three whom he considered good, and he was not
deceived, for they continued to be customers of his
to this day. The amount of goods that each of
these took of him was 20<i>s.</i>; and the three instalments
of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each (4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week) the tallyman
determined to subsist upon, though his lodging
and washing cost him 2<i>s.</i> per week. He
lived principally upon “parritch” and skim milk,
indulging now and then in the luxury of a herring
and a few potatoes. In twelve weeks he had
added only one more credit customer to his books.
He had hawked for ready money, and had succeeded
so far as to increase his stock to 15<i>l.</i> in
value. His first three customers had, by this
time, paid their accounts, and again patronized him.
In the course of a little time his fourth customer
had also paid up, and had another supply of
goods; he then added two more tally customers,
and commenced indulging (though very seldom) in a
mutton chop. He progressed slowly, and is now
in flourishing circumstances. He states that he
has met with only one loss during his connection
with the tally-trade, and that but a trifling one.
It is those who wish to drive a very extensive
business, he says, who are principally victimised.
The most industrious of the packmen tallymen
seldom travel less than twenty miles a day, carrying
a burthen upon their backs of from 100
to 120 lbs. They used to carry merely patterns
to their customers, but they find that the full-length
article is more likely to secure purchasers
and customers. Those who keep shops do not
carry goods with them; the would-be customer is
invited to the shop.</p>

<p>The best day for business in the tally-trade is
Monday, and most of these shops upon that day
are crowded. Sometimes an unsolicited customer
(mostly a female) presents herself, and wishes to
be supplied with goods on tally. “Who recommended
you?” inquires the tallyman. “Oh,
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, sir, a customer of yours.” “Ah!
indeed, very much obliged to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,” is the
answer. The articles required are shown, selected,
and cut. The new customer is treated most civilly
by the tallyman, who further inquires her name
and abode. The purchaser, of course, expects the
next process will be to deliver up the parcel to
her, when she is informed that they “will send it
home for her.” “Oh,” she replies, “I won’t
trouble you, I can carry it myself.” “Our rule,
ma’am,” returns the tallyman, “is always to send
parcels home. We certainly cannot doubt your
respectability, but we never deviate from our practice.”
The disappointed female departs, and if
the inquiries do not prove satisfactory, she never
hears further from the tallyman. The goods which
she selected, and which were cut expressly for her,
find their way to the shelves of the establishment.
If, however, a good customer accompanies a friend
whom she wishes to recommend, the parcels are
delivered when purchased, if required. The tallyman
(to good customers) often extends his civilities
to a glass of wine; or, if the “Ladies” prefer
it (which it must be confessed they mostly do), a
glass of gin.</p>

<p>There is another class of tallymen who sell
clocks, receiving payment by weekly instalments.
These are content with an instalment of 1<i>s.</i> in
the pound per week. They are principally
Germans who can speak English. Their proceedings
altogether are similar to the tally linen-draper.</p>

<p>I have given the rise and progress of a Scotch
tallyman, and will now relate the downfall of
another&mdash;an Englishman. He commenced a tally-shop
in the neighbourhood of &mdash;&mdash;, and was
carrying on a prosperous and daily increasing
trade. At one time, a bill in the shop window
announced that an errand boy was wanted&mdash;an
applicant soon presented himself&mdash;was engaged,
and proved a steady lad. In the course of a few
weeks, this youth was promoted to the office of
serving in the shop, and afterwards became collecting
clerk. “George,” said his master one day,
“we have three days in the week unemployed;
suppose you try and form a connection around
Finchley, Highgate, Hampstead, and that neighbourhood.”
George was quite willing to make
the experiment, and succeeded beyond expectation.
The country connection soon surpassed the
town trade; and George, the errand boy, became
a man of some consequence in the establishment.
The principal of the firm was what is termed
“gay.” He was particularly fond of attending
public entertainments. He sported a little as
well, and delighted in horse-racing. His business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
though an excellent one, was neglected; the
books got out of order; and he became involved
in difficulties. An examination of his
affairs took place; and a Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; was engaged
from a wholesale house in the city to assist in
making up the accounts, &amp;c. During this person’s
sojourn in the shop, he saw that George (the
quondam errand boy) was the chief support of the
concern. The country customers had never seen
any other person, and a partnership was proposed.
The proposal was accepted, and the firm R&mdash;&mdash;
and W&mdash;&mdash; became one of the most prosperous
tally-shops in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road.
George’s master was made bankrupt,
and is now a street-seller in Fitzroy-market&mdash;vending
sandwiches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The cases are not a few where ruin has followed
a connection with the tallymen. I will particularize
one instance related to me on good
authority. A lawyer’s clerk married, when young,
a milliner; his salary was a guinea per week, and
he and his wife had agreed to “get on in the
world.” They occupied furnished lodgings at
first, but soon accumulated furniture of their own,
and every week added some little useful article
towards their household stock. “At the end of
a year,” said the individual in question, “I had
as comfortable a little home as any man would
wish to possess; I was fond of it too, and would
rather have been there than anywhere else. My
wife frequently wished to obtain credit; ‘it would
be so easy,’ said she, ‘to pay a trifling instalment,
and then we could obtain immediately whatever
we might want.’ I objected, and preferred
supplying our wants gradually, knowing that for
ready money I could purchase to much better advantage.
Consequently we still kept progressing,
and I was really happy. Judge my astonishment
one day, when I came home, and found an execution
was in the house. My wife had run in debt
with the tallyman unknown to me. Summonses
had been served, which by some means she had
concealed from me. The goods which I had taken
so much pains to procure were seized and sold.
But this was not all. My wife grew so much
alarmed at the misery she had caused that she
fled from me, and I have never seen her but once
since. This occurred seven years ago, and she
has been for some time the companion of those
who hold their virtue of little worth. For some
time after this I cared not what became of me; I
lost my situation, and sunk to be a supernumerary
for 1<i>s.</i> a night at one of the theatres. Here,
after being entrusted with a line to speak, I
eventually rose to a ‘general utility man,’ at 12<i>s.</i>
per week. With this and some copying, that I
occasionally obtain from the law-stationers, I
manage to live, but far from comfortably, for I
never think of saving now, and only look out for
copying when I stand in need of more money.
I am always poor, and scarcely ever have a shilling
to call my own.”</p>

<p>Some of the principal establishments, “doing
largely” in the tally-trade, are in or about Red
Lion-square and street, the higher part of High
Holborn, the vicinity of Tottenham-court-road,
the Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster, St.
George’s, Walworth, New Kent, and Dover
roads.</p>

<p>At some of these tally-shops horses and carts
are kept to carry out the goods ordered of the
“travellers,” especially when furniture is supplied
as well as drapery; while in others the “travellers”
are resident on the premises, and are occasionally
shopmen, for a “large” tally-master not
unfrequently carries on a retail trade in addition
to his tally-business.</p>

<p>The tallymen not concerned with these large
establishments, but carrying on trade on their own
account, reside generally in the quieter streets in
the neighbourhood of the thoroughfares I have
mentioned, and occupy perhaps the ground-floor,
letting (for the house is generally their own) the
other apartments. Sometimes a piece of cotton-print
is placed in their parlour-window, and sometimes
there is no indication whatever of any
business being carried on within, for the hawking
tallymen do not depend in any measure upon
situation or display, but solely on travelling and
personal solicitations at people’s own residences.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Duffers” or Hawkers of Pretended
Smuggled Goods.</span></h3>

<p>Of “duffers” and “lumpers,” as regards the sale
of textile fabrics, there are generally, I am informed,
about twenty in London. At such times as
Epsom, Ascot-heath, or Goodwood races, however,
there is, perhaps, not one. All have departed to
prey, if possible, upon the countrymen. Eight of
them are Jews, and the majority of the others are
Irishmen. They are generally dressed as sailors,
and some wear either fur caps, or cloth ones, with
gilt bands round them, as if they were the mates
or stewards of ships. They look out for any
likely victim at public-houses, and sometimes accost
persons in the streets&mdash;first looking carefully about
them, and hint that they are smugglers, and have
the finest and cheapest “Injy” handkerchiefs ever
seen. These goods are now sold in “pieces” of
three handkerchiefs. When times were better, I
was told, they were in pieces of four, five, and six.
One street-seller said to me, “Yes, I know the
‘duffers;’ all of them. They do more business
than you might think. Everybody likes a smuggled
thing; and I should say these men, each of
the ‘duffers,’ tops his 1<i>l.</i> a week, clear profit.” I
am assured that one of the classes most numerously
victimised is a body who generally account themselves
pretty sharp, viz. gentlemen’s grooms, and
coachmen at the several mews. Sailors are the
best customers, and the vicinity of the docks the
best locality for this trade; for the hawker of
pretended smuggled goods always does most
business among the “tars.” The mock handkerchiefs
are damped carefully with a fine sponge,
before they are offered for sale; and they are
often strongly perfumed, some of the Jews supplying
cheap perfumes, or common “scents.” When
the “duffer” thinks he may venture upon the assertion,
he assures a customer that this is “the smell
the handkerchiefs brought with ’em from foreign
parts, as they was smuggled in a bale of spices!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
The trade however is not without its hazards; for
I am informed that the “duffers” sometimes, on
attempting their impositions imprudently, and
sometimes on being discovered before they can
leave the house, get soundly thrashed. They
have, of course, no remedy.</p>

<p>The “pieces” of three handkerchiefs sold
by the “duffers” are purchased by them in
Houndsditch, at from 3<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i>; but 7<i>s.</i> is only
given when there is a design to palm off the 3<i>s.</i>
goods along with them. Cent. per cent. is a low
profit in this trade.</p>

<p>One intelligent street-trader, to whom I am
indebted for carefully-considered information, said
to me very quietly: “I’ve read your work, sir,
at a coffee-shop; for I can’t afford to take it in.
I know you’re going to open the eyes of the
public as to the ‘duffer’s’ tricks, now. All
right, sir, they’re in honest men’s ways. But,
sir, when are you going to say something about
the rich shopkeepers as sells, and the rich manufacturers
as makes, the ‘duffer’s’ things? Every
man of them knows it’s for roguery.”</p>

<p>There is a peculiar style among the “duffers;”
they never fold their goods neatly&mdash;the same as
drapers do, but thrust them into the pack, in a
confused heap, as if they did not understand their
value&mdash;or their business. There are other classes
of “duffers” whose calling is rather more hazardous
than the licensed-hawker “duffer.” “I have often
thought it strange,” says a correspondent, “that
these men could induce any one to credit the
fact of their being sailors, for, notwithstanding
the showy manner in which they chew their quid,
and the jack-tar like fashion in which they suffer
their whiskers to grow, there is such a fresh-waterfied
appearance about them, that they look
no more like a regular mariner than the supernumerary
seamen in a nautical drama, at the Victoria
Theatre. Yet they obtain victims readily. Their
mode of proceeding in the streets is to accost their
intended dupes, while walking by their side; they
usually speak in a half whisper, as they keep
pace with them, and look mysteriously around to
see if there be any of ‘them ere Custom-house
sharks afloat.’ They address the simple-looking
passers by thus: ‘Shipmate’ (here they take off
their fur-cap and spit their quid into it)&mdash;‘shipmate,
I’ve just come ashore arter a long voyage&mdash;and
splice me but I’ve something in the locker
that’ll be of service to you; and, shiver my timbers’
(they are very profuse in nautical terms), ‘you
shall have it at your own price, for I’m determined
to have a spree, and I haven’t a shot in the
locker; helm’s a-lee; just let’s turn into this
creek, and I’ll show you what it is’ (perhaps he persuades
his dupe down a court, or to a neighbouring
public-house). ‘Now here is a beautiful piece of
<i>Ingy</i> handkerchiefs.’ (They are the coarsest description
of spun not <i>thrown</i> silk, well stiffened into
stoutness, and cost the “duffer” perhaps 15<i>d.</i> each;
but as business is always done on the sly, in a hurry,
and to escape observation, an examination seldom
or never takes place). ‘I got ’em on shore in
spite of those pirates, the Custom-house officers.
You shall have ’em cheap, there’s half a dozen on
’em, they cost me 30<i>s.</i> at Madras, you shall have
’em for the same money.’ (The victim, may be,
is not inclined to purchase. The pretended tar,
however, must have money.) ‘Will you give me 25<i>s.</i>
for them?’ he says; ‘d&mdash;n it, a pound? Shiver
my topsails, you don’t want them any cheaper than
that, do you!’ The ‘duffer’ says this to make
his dupe believe that he really does want the
goods, or has offered a price for them. Perhaps
if the ‘duffer’ cannot extort more he takes 10<i>s.</i>
for the half dozen ‘Ingy’ handkerchiefs, the profit
being thus about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but more frequently he
gets 100 and even 200 per cent. on his transactions
according to the gullibility of his customers. The
‘duffer’ deals also in cigars; he accosts his victim
in the same style as when selling handkerchiefs,
and gives himself the same sailor-like airs.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the ‘duffers’ visit the obscure streets
in London, where there are small chandlers’
shops; one of them enters, leaving his mate outside
to give him the signal in case the enemy
heaves in sight. He requests to be served with
some trifling article&mdash;when if he approve of the
physiognomy of the shopkeeper, and consider him or
her likely to be victimised&mdash;he ventures an observation
as to how enormously everything is taxed
(though to one less innocent it might appear unusual
for a sailor to talk politics); ‘even this ’ere
baccy’ he says, taking out his quid, ‘I can’t
chew, without paying a tax; but,’ he adds,
chuckling&mdash;‘us sailor chaps sometimes shirks
the Custom-house lubbers, sharp as they are.’
(Here his companion outside puts his head in at
the door, and, to make the scene as natural as possible,
says, ‘Come, Jack, don’t stop there all night
spinning your yarns; come, bear a hand, or I shall
part convoy.’) ‘Oh, heave to a bit longer, my
hearty,’ replies the ‘duffer,’ ‘I will be with you in
the twinkling of a marling spike. I’ll tell you what
we’ve got, marm, and if you likes to buy it you shall
have it cheap, for me and my mate are both short of
rhino. We’ve half-a-dozen pounds of tea&mdash;you can
weigh it if you like&mdash;and you shall have the lot
for 12<i>s.</i>’ Perhaps there is an immediate purchase,
but if 12<i>s.</i> is refused, then 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> is asked,
until a sale be effected, after which the sailors
make their exit as quickly as possible. Then
the chandler’s-shop keeper begins to exult over
the bargain he or she has made, and to examine
more minutely the contents of the neatly
packed, and tea-like looking packet thus bought.
It proves to be lined with a profuse quantity of
tea lead, and though some Chinese characters
are marked on the outside, it is discovered on
opening to contain only half-a-pound of tea, the
remainder consisting principally of chopped hay.
The ‘duffers’ enact the same part, and if a purchaser
buy 10 lbs. of the smuggled article, then
9 lbs. at least consist of the same chopped hay.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the ‘duffers’ sell all their stock to
one individual. No sooner do they dispose of
the handkerchiefs to a dupe, than they introduce
the smuggled tobacco to the notice of the
unsuspecting customer; then they palm off their
cigars, next their tea, and lastly, as the ‘duffer’ is
determined to raise as much money as he can ‘to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
have his spree;’ ‘why d&mdash;e,’ he exclaims to his
victim&mdash;‘I’ll sell you my watch. It cost me 6<i>l.</i> at
Portsmouth&mdash;give me 3<i>l.</i> for it and it’s yours,
shipmate. Well, then, 2<i>l.</i>&mdash;&mdash;1<i>l.</i>’ The watch, I
need not state, is made solely for sale.</p>

<p>“It is really astonishing,” adds my informant,
“how these men ever succeed, for their look denotes
cunning and imposition, and their proceedings
have been so often exposed in the newspapers
that numbers are alive to their tricks, and warn
others when they perceive the “duffers” endeavouring
to victimise them; but, as the thimble-men
say, “There’s a fool born every minute.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of “Small-Ware,”
or Tape, Cotton, etc.</span></h3>

<p>The street-sellers of tape and cotton are usually
elderly females; and during my former inquiry I
was directed to one who had been getting her
living in the street by such means for nine years.
I was given to understand that the poor woman
was in deep distress, and that she had long been
supporting a sick husband by her little trade, but
I was wholly unprepared for a scene of such startling
misery, sublimed by untiring affection and
pious resignation, as I there discovered.</p>

<p>I wish the reader to understand that I do not
cite this case as a type of the sufferings of this
particular class, but rather as an illustration of the
afflictions which frequently befall those who are
solely dependent on their labour, or their little
trade, for their subsistence, and who, from the
smallness of their earnings, are unable to lay by
even the least trifle as a fund against any physical
calamity.</p>

<p>The poor creatures lived in one of the close
alleys at the east end of London. On inquiring
at the house to which I had been directed, I was
told I should find them in “the two-pair back.”
I mounted the stairs, and on opening the door of
the apartment I was terrified with the misery
before me. There, on a wretched bed, lay an aged
man in almost the last extremity of life. At
first I thought the poor old creature was really
dead, but a tremble of the eyelids as I closed the
door, as noiselessly as I could, told me that he
breathed. His face was as yellow as clay, and it
had more the cold damp look of a corpse than that
of a living man. His cheeks were hollowed in
with evident want, his temples sunk, and his nostrils
pinched close. On the edge of the bed sat his
heroic wife, giving him drink with a spoon from a
tea-cup. In one corner of the room stood the
basket of tapes, cottons, combs, braces, nutmeg-graters,
and shaving-glasses, with which she strove
to keep her old dying husband from the workhouse.
I asked her how long her good man
had been ill, and she told me he had been confined
to his bed five weeks last Wednesday, and that it
was ten weeks since he had eaten the size of a
nut in solid food. Nothing but a little beef-tea
had passed his lips for months. “We have lived
like children together,” said the old woman, as her
eyes flooded with tears, “and never had no dispute.
He hated drink, and there was no cause for
us to quarrel. One of my legs, you see, is shorter
than the other,” said she, rising from the bed-side,
and showing me that her right foot was several
inches from the ground as she stood. “My hip
is out. I used to go out washing, and walking
in my pattens I fell down. My hip is out
of the socket three-quarters of an inch, and the
sinews is drawn up. I am obliged to walk with
a stick.” Here the man groaned and coughed so
that I feared the exertion must end his life. “Ah,
the heart of a stone would pity that poor fellow,”
said the good wife.</p>

<p>“After I put my hip out, I couldn’t get my
living as I’d been used to do. I couldn’t
stand a day if I had five hundred pounds for
it. I must sit down. So I got a little stall,
and sat at the end of the alley here with a few
laces and tapes and things. I’ve done so for this
nine year past, and seen many a landlord come in
and go out of the house that I sat at. My husband
used to sell small articles in the streets&mdash;black lead
and furniture paste, and blacking. We got a sort
of a living by this, the two of us together. It’s
very seldom though we had a bit of meat. We
had 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> rent to pay&mdash;Come, my poor fellow,
will you have another little drop to wet your
mouth?” said the woman, breaking off. “Come,
my dearest, let me give you this,” she added,
as the man let his jaw fall, and she poured some
warm sugar and water flavoured with cinnamon&mdash;all
she had to give him&mdash;into his mouth. “He’s
been an ailing man this many a year. He used
to go of errands and buy my little things for
me, on account of my being lame. We assisted
one another, you see. He wasn’t able to work for
his living, and I wasn’t able to go about, so he
used to go about and buy for me what I sold. I
am sure he never earned above 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the week.
He used to attend me, and many a time I’ve sat
for ten and fourteen hours in the cold and wet
and didn’t take a sixpence. Some days I’d make
a shilling, and some days less; but whatever I got
I used to have to put a good part into the basket
to keep my little stock.” [A knock here came to
the door; it was for a halfpenny-worth of darning
cotton.] “You know a shilling goes further with
a poor couple that’s sober than two shillings does
with a drunkard. We lived poor, you see, never
had nothing but tea, or we couldn’t have done
anyhow. If I’d take 18<i>d.</i> in the day I’d think
I was grandly off, and then if there was 6<i>d.</i> profit
got out of that it would be almost as much as it
would. You see these cotton braces here” (said
the old woman, going to her tray). “Well, I gives
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a dozen for them here, and I sells ’em for
4&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and oftentimes 4<i>d.</i> a pair. Now, this piece
of tape would cost me seven farthings in the shop,
and I sells it at six yards a penny. It has the
<i>name</i> of being eighteen yards. The profit out of
it is five farthings. It’s beyond the power of man
to wonder how there’s a bit of bread got out of
such a small way. And the times is so bad, too!
I think I could say I get 8<i>d.</i> a day profit if
I have any sort of custom, but I don’t exceed
that at the best of times. I’ve often sat at the
end of the alley and taken only 6<i>d.</i>, and that’s
not much more than 2<i>d.</i> clear&mdash;it an’t 3<i>d.</i> I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
sure. I think I could safely state that for the
last nine year me and my husband has earned together
5<i>s.</i> a week, and out of that the two of us
had to live and pay rent&mdash;1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a week. Clothes
I could buy none, for the best garment is on me;
but I thank the Lord still. I’ve paid my rent all
but three weeks, and that isn’t due till to-morrow.
We have often reckoned it up here at the fire.
Some weeks we have got 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and some weeks
less, so that I judge we have had about 3<i>s.</i> to
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week to live upon the two of us, for this
nine year past. Half-a-hundred of coals would
fit me the week in the depths of winter. My husband
had the kettle always boiling for me against
I came in. He used to sit here reading his
book&mdash;he never was fit for work at the best&mdash;while
I used to be out minding the basket. He
was so sober and quiet too. His neighbours will
tell that of him. Within the last ten weeks he’s
been very ill indeed, but still I could be out with
the basket. Since then he’s never earnt me a
penny&mdash;poor old soul, he wasn’t able! All that
time I still attended to my basket. He wasn’t so
ill then but what he could do a little here in the
room for hisself; but he wanted little, God knows,
for he couldn’t eat. After he fell ill, I had to go
all my errands myself. I had no one to help me,
for I’d nothing to pay them, and I’d have to walk
from here down to Sun-street with my stick, till
my bad leg pained me so that I could hardly
stand. You see the hip being put out has drawn
all the sinews up into my groin, and it leaves me
oncapable of walking or standing constantly;
but I thank God that I’ve got the use of it anyhow.
Our lot’s hard enough, goodness knows,
but we are content. We never complain, but bless
the Lord for the little he pleases to give us. When
I was away on my errands, in course I couldn’t be
minding my basket; so I lost a good bit of money
that way. Well, five weeks on Wednesday he has
been totally confined to his bed, excepting when I
lifted him up to make it some nights; but he can’t
bear <i>that</i> now. Still the first fortnight he was
bad, I did manage to leave him, and earn a few
pence; but, latterly, for this last three weeks, I
haven’t been able to go out at all, to do anything.”</p>

<p>“She’s been stopping by me, minding me
here night and day all that time,” mumbled the
old man, who now for the first time opened his
gray glassy eyes and turned towards me, to bear,
as it were, a last tribute to his wife’s incessant
affection. “She has been most kind to me. Her
tenderness and care has been such that man never
knew from woman before, ever since I lay upon
this sick bed. We’ve been married five-and-twenty
years. We have always lived happily&mdash;very
happily, indeed&mdash;together. Until sickness
and weakness overcome me I always strove to
help myself a bit, as well as I could; but since
then she has done all in her power for me&mdash;worked
for me&mdash;ay, she has worked for me,
surely&mdash;and watched over me. My creed through
life has been repentance towards God, faith in
Jesus Christ, and love to all my brethren. I’ve
made up my mind that I must soon change this
tabernacle, and my last wish is that the good
people of this world will increase her little stock
for her. She cannot get her living out of the little
stock she has, and since I lay here it’s so lessened,
that neither she nor no one else can live upon it.
If the kind hearts would give her but a little stock
more, it would keep her old age from want, as she
has kept mine. Indeed, indeed, she does deserve
it. But the Lord, I know, will reward her for
all she has done to me.” Here the old man’s
eyelids dropped exhausted.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a shilling and a loaf twice from
the parish,” continued the woman. “The overseer
came to see if my old man was fit to be
removed to the workhouse. The doctor gave me
a certificate that he was not, and then the relieving
officer gave me a shilling and a loaf of
bread, and out of that shilling I bought the poor
old fellow a sup of port wine. I bought a quartern
of wine, which was 4<i>d.</i>, and I gave 5<i>d.</i> for a bit
of tea and sugar, and I gave 2<i>d.</i> for coals; a halfpenny
rushlight I bought, and a short candle, that
made a penny&mdash;and that’s the way I laid out the
shilling. If God takes him, I know he’ll sleep
in heaven. I know the life he’s spent, and am
not afraid; but no one else shall take him from
me&mdash;nothing shall part us but death in this world.
Poor old soul, he can’t be long with me. He’s a
perfect skeleton. His bones are starting through
his skin.”</p>

<p>I asked what could be done for her, and the
old man thrust forth his skinny arm, and
laying hold of the bed-post, he raised himself
slightly in his bed, as he murmured “If she could
be got into a little parlour, and away from sitting
in the streets, it would be the saving of her.”
And, so saying, he fell back overcome with the
exertion, and breathed heavily.</p>

<p>The woman sat down beside me, and went on.
“What shocked him most was that I was obligated
in his old age to go and ask for relief at
the parish. You see, he was always a spiritful
man, and it hurted him sorely that he should
come to this at last, and for the first time in his
lifetime. The only parish money that ever we
had was this, and it <i>does</i> hurt him every day
to think that he must be buried by the parish
after all. He was always proud, you see.”</p>

<p>I told the kind-hearted old dame that some benevolent
people had placed certain funds at my
disposal for the relief of such distress as hers;
and I assured her that neither she nor her husband
should want for anything that might ease
their sufferings.</p>

<p>The day after the above was written, the poor
old man died. He was buried out of the funds
sent to the “Morning Chronicle,” and his wife received
some few pounds to increase her stock;
but in a few months the poor old woman went
mad, and is now, I believe, the inmate of one of
the pauper lunatic asylums.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Lace.</span></h3>

<p>This trade is carried on both by itinerants and at
stands, or “pitches.” The itinerants, of whom I
will first treat, are about forty in number (thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
women and ten men). They usually carry their
lace in boxes, or cases. It is not uncommon for
the women to represent themselves as lacemakers
from Marlow, or some other place in Buckinghamshire,
or from Honiton, in Devonshire, while the
men assert they are from Nottingham. I am informed
that there are among these itinerant lace-sellers
two women and one man who really have
been lacemakers. They all buy their wares at
the haberdashery swag-shops.</p>

<p>The lace, which is the principal staple of this
trade, is “edgings,” or the several kinds of cheap
lace used for the bordering of caps and other
female requirements. Among street-people the
lace is called “driz,” and the sellers of it “driz-fencers.”
It gained this slang name, I was informed,
many years ago, when it was sold, and
often to wealthy ladies, as rare and valuable lace,
smuggled from Mechlin, Brussels, Valenciennes,
or any foreign place famous, or once famous, for
its manufacture. The pretended smuggled lace
trade is now unknown in London, and is very
little practised in the country. There is, however,
still some smuggling connected with lace-selling.
Two, and sometimes three, female lace-sellers
are also “jigger-workers.” They carry
about their persons pint bladders of “stuff,” or
“jigger stuff” (spirit made at an illicit still). “I
used to supply them with it until lately,” one
street-trader told me, “from a friend that kept a
‘jigger,’ and a tidy sale some of them had. Indeed,
I’ve made the stuff myself. I knew one woman,
six or seven years back, that did uncommon well
at first, but she got too fond of the stuff, and
drank herself into the work’us. They never
carried gin, for brandy was most asked for. They
sold the brandy at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the pint; rum at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
and whiskey at 2<i>s.</i>; sometimes higher, and always
trying for 6<i>d.</i> a pint profit, at least. O yes, sir;
I know they got the prices I’ve mentioned, though
they seem high; for you must remember that the
jigger spirit is above proof, and a pint will make
two pints of gin-palace stuff. They sold it, I’ve
heard them say, to ladies that liked a drop on the
sly; and to some as pretended they bought that
way for economy; yes, and to shopkeepers and
publicans too. One old lady used to give 3<i>s.</i> for
three yards of driz, and it was well enough understood,
without no words, that a pint of brandy
was part of them three yards. But the trade that
way is nothing to what it was, and gets less and
less every year.”</p>

<p>From a middle-aged woman selling laces I had
the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been in the trade about six years, sir.
Ten years back or more I was in place, and saved
a little money, as a servant of all work. I married
a house-painter, but trade got bad, and we
both had illnesses; and my husband, though he’s
as good a man as need be, can’t stick to anything
very long at a time.” (A very common failing, by
the bye, with the street-folk.) “It seems not in
his nature. When we was reduced very low he got
on a cab&mdash;for he can turn his hand to almost anything&mdash;and
after that we came to street-selling.
He’s now on jewellery, and I think it suits him as
well or better than anything he’s tried; I do my
part, and we get on middling. If we’re ever pushed
it’s no use fretting. We had one child, and he
died when he wanted just a month of three years
old, and after I’d lost him I said I would never
fret for trifles no more. My heart was broke for
a long time&mdash;it was indeed. He was the loveliest
boy ever seen, and everybody said so. I went
into lace, because my husband got to know all
about it, and I had no tie at home then. I was
very shy and ashamed at first to go into houses,
but that wears off, and I met with some nice
people that bought of me and was very civil, so
that encourages one. I sell nothing but lace. I
never cleared more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in a day, and that
only once. I suppose I clear from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week now; perhaps, take it altogether,
rather more than 4<i>s.</i> I have a connection, and go
to the houses in and about the Regent’s Park, and
all the small streets near it, and sometimes Maida
Hill way. I once tried a little millinery made-up
things, but it didn’t suit somehow, and I didn’t
stick to it. You see, sir, I sell my lace to very
few but servant maids and small shopkeepers’
wives and daughters; but then they’re a better sort
of people than those as has to buy everything
ready made like servants has. They can use their
own needles to make themselves nice and smart,
and they buy of such as me to do it cheap, and
they’re not often such beaters down as them that
buys the ready-made. I can do nothing, or next
to nothing, in very wet weather. If I’m in the
habit of going into a nice kitchen, perhaps the
housemaid flies at me for ‘bringing in all that
dirt.’ My husband says all women is crossest in
bad weather, and perhaps servants is.</p>

<p>“I buy my lace near Shoreditch. It’s a long
walk, but I think I’m best used there. I buy
generally a dozen yards, from 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>, and
sometimes up to 2<i>s.</i> I sell the commoner at 1<i>d.</i>
a yard, and three yards 2<i>d.</i>; and the better at 2<i>d.</i>
and 3<i>d.</i> a yard. It’s a poor trade, but it’s doing
something. My husband seldom earns less than
12<i>s.</i> a week, for he’s a good salesman, and so we
pay 2<i>s.</i> rent regular every Monday for an unfurnished
room, and has the rest to live on. I have
sold in the Brill on a Saturday night, but not often,
nor lately I don’t like it; I haven’t tongue enough.”</p>

<p>In addition to the itinerants there are about seventy
stationary lace sellers, and not less than eighty
on the Saturday evenings. The best pitches are,
I am told, near the Borough-market; in Clare-market;
the New Cut (on Saturday nights); Walworth-road;
Tooley-street; and Dockhead, Bermondsey.
From the best information at my command,
it appears that at least half of these traders
sell only lace, or rarely anything else. The others
sell also net for making caps and “cauls,” which
are the plain portion at the back, to be trimmed or
edged according to the purchaser’s taste. Some
sell also, with their lace, cap ribbons&mdash;plain or
worked collars&mdash;and muslin, net, or worked undersleeves.
Braid and gimp were formerly sold by them,
but are now in no demand. The prices run from
2<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> for lace articles, and about the same for
net, &amp;c. per yard; the lowest priced are most sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>In this stationary trade are as many men and
youths as women and girls. One woman, who
had known street-selling for upwards of twenty
years, said she could not do half so well now as
she could twenty years ago, for the cheaper things
got the cheaper people would have them. “Why,
twenty year ago,” she exclaimed, “I bought a
lot of ‘leno’ cheap&mdash;it was just about going out
of fashion for caps then, I think&mdash;and one Saturday
night in the Cut, I cleared 15<i>s.</i> on it. I don’t
clear that in a fortnight now. I have sold to women
of the town, as far as I’ve known them to be
of that sort, but very seldom. It’s not often
you’ll catch <i>them</i> using a needle for theirselves.
They do use their needles, I know. You can see
some of them sewing at their doors and windows
in Granby-street, Waterloo-road, or could lately&mdash;for
I haven’t passed that way for some time&mdash;but
I believe it’s all for money down, for the slop-shops.
It suits the slop-shops to get work cheap
anyway; and it suits the women to have some sort
of occupation, which they needn’t depend upon for
their living.”</p>

<p>The stationary lace sellers, for the most part,
display their goods on stalls, but some spread them
on a board, or on matting on the ground. Some
of the men gather an audience by shouting out,
“Three yards a penny, edging!” As at this rate
the lace-seller would only clear &frac12;<i>d.</i> in a dozen yards,
the cry is merely uttered to attract attention. A
few who patter at the trade&mdash;but far fewer than
was once the case&mdash;give short measure. One man,
who occasionally sold lace, told me, that when he
was compelled to sell for “next to no profit, and a
hungry Sunday coming,” he gave good shop measure,
thirty full inches to a yard. His yard wand
was the correct length, “but I can do it, sir,” he
said with some exultation, “by palming,” and he
gave a jerk to his fingers, to show how he caught in
the lace, and “clipped it short.”</p>

<p>Calculating that 100 persons in this trade each
take 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, the profit being about cent.
per cent., we find 2,730<i>l.</i> expended in the streets
in lace and similar commodities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Japanned Table-Covers.</span></h3>

<p>This trade, like several others, as soon as the
new commodities became in established demand,
and sufficiently cheap, was adopted by street-sellers.
It has been a regular street-trade between
four and five years. Previously, when the covers
were dearer, the street-sellers were afraid to speculate
much in them; but one man told me that he
once sold a table-cover for 8<i>s.</i>, and at another time
for 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The goods are supplied to the street-folk principally
by three manufacturers&mdash;in Long-lane, Smithfield,
Whitechapel-road, and Petticoat-lane. The
venders of the glazed table-covers are generally
considered among the smartest of the street-folk,
as they do not sell to the poor, or in poor neighbourhoods,
but “at the better sort of houses, and
to the wealthier sort of people.” Table-covers are
now frequently disposed of by raffle. “I very
seldom sell in the streets,” said one man, “though
I one evening cleared 4<i>s.</i> by standing near the
Vinegar-works, in the City-road, and selling to
gents on their way home from the city. The
public-house trade is the best, and indeed in winter
evenings, and after dark generally, there’s no
other. I get rid of more by raffling than by sale.
On Saturday evening I had raffles for two covers,
which cost me 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each. I had some trouble
to get 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> for one; but I got up a raffle for
the other, and it brought me 2<i>s.</i>; six members at
4<i>d.</i> each. It’s just the sort of thing to get off in
a raffle on Saturday night, or any time when mechanics
have money. A man thinks&mdash;leastways
I’ve thought so myself, when I’ve been in a
public-house raffle&mdash;now I’ve spent more money
than I ought to, and there’s the old woman to
face; but if I win the raffle, and take the thing
home, why my money has gone to buy a nice
thing, and not for drink.” I may remark that in
nearly all raffles got up in this manner, the article
raffled for is generally something coveted by a
working man, but not so indispensably necessary
to him, that he feels justified in expending his
money upon it. This fact seems well enough
known to the street-sellers who frequent public-houses
with their wares. I inquired of the informant
in question if he had ever tried to get up
a raffle of his table-covers in a coffee-shop as well
as a public-house. “Never, with table-covers,”
he said, “but I have with other things, and find
it’s no go. In a coffee-shop people are quiet, and
reading, unless it’s one of them low places for
young thieves, and such like; and they’ve no
money very likely, and I wouldn’t like to trust
them in a raffle if they had. In public-houses
there’s talk and fun, and people’s more inclined
for a raffle, or anything spicy that offers.”</p>

<p>There are now fifteen regular street-sellers, or
street-hawkers of these table-covers, in London,
four of whom are the men’s wives, and they not
unfrequently go a round together. Sometimes, on
fine days, there are twenty. I heard of one
woman who had been very successful in bartering
table-covers for old clothes. “I’ve done a little
that way myself,” said a man in the trade, “but
nothing to her, and people sees into things so now,
that there’s hardly a chance for a crust. The
covers is so soft and shiny, and there’s such fine
parrots and birds of paradise on them, that before
the price was known there was a chance of a good
bargain. I once got for a cover that cost me 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
a great coat that a Jew, after a hard bargaining,
gave me 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for.”</p>

<p>The prices of the table-covers (wholesale) run
from 8<i>s.</i> a dozen to 30<i>s.</i>; but the street-sellers
rarely go to a higher price than 18<i>s.</i> They can
buy a dozen, or half a dozen&mdash;or even a smaller
quantity&mdash;of different sizes. Some of these street-traders
sell, with the table-covers, a few wash-leathers,
of the better kind. Calculating that
fifteen street-sellers each take 25<i>s.</i> weekly the
year round&mdash;one-half being the profit, including
their advantages in bartering and raffling&mdash;we
find 975<i>l.</i> expended yearly upon japanned table-covers,
bought in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Braces, Belts,
Hose, Trowser-straps, and Waistcoats.</span></h3>

<p>The street-sellers of braces are a numerous and a
mixed class. They are nearly all men, and the
majority are Irishmen; but this relates only to
the itinerant or public-house brace-sellers. These
wares are sold also by street-traders, who make
other articles the staple of their trade&mdash;such as
the dog-collar-sellers.</p>

<p>The braces sold thirty years ago were of a very
different manufacture from those vended in the
streets at present. India-rubber web was then
unknown as a component part of the street braces.
The braces, which in some parts of the country
are called “gallowses,” were, at the time specified,
made of a woollen web, both washable and durable.
“One pair of such braces, good ones,” said an old
tailor with whom I had some talk on the subject,
“would last a poor man his lifetime. Now
they’re in a rope or in rags in no time.” These
woollen braces were sold at from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> the
pair in the streets; the straps being of good firm
leather. Not long after this period a much
cheaper brace-web was introduced&mdash;a mixture of
cotton with the woollen&mdash;and the cheap manufacture
gradually supplanted the better article, as respects
the street trade. The cheaper braces were
made with sheepskin straps, which soon yielded
to friction, and were little serviceable. The introduction
of the India-rubber web was another change
in the trade, and the manufacture has become lower
and lower-priced until the present time.</p>

<p>The braces sold in the streets, or hawked in
the public-houses, are, however, not all of the very
inferior manufacture. Some are called “silk,”
others “buck-leather,” and others “knitted
cotton.” The “silk” are of a silken surface, with
an admixture of cotton and India-rubber; the
“buck-leather” (a kind now very little known in
street sale) are of strong sheepskin, dressed buck-leather
fashion; and the “knitted” cotton are
woven, some kinds of them being very good and
strong.</p>

<p>The street brace-sellers, when trying to do
business in the streets, carry their goods generally
with a few belts, and sometimes with hose in
their hands and across their arms. They stretch
them from end to end, as they invite the custom
of passers by, to evince the elasticity and firmness
of the web. Sometimes the braces are slung from
a pole carried on the shoulder. The sellers call
at the public-house bars and tap-rooms; some are
admitted into the parlours; and at a well-frequented
gin-palace, I was informed by a manager
of one, a brace-seller will call from twelve to
twenty times a day, especially on a Monday;
while on a Saturday evening they will remain two,
three, or four hours, accosting fresh customers.
At the gin-palaces, the young and strong Irishmen
offering these wares&mdash;and there are many such&mdash;are
frequently scoffed at for selling “braces and
things a baby can carry.”</p>

<p>The following account, which I received from a
street brace-seller, shows the class who purchase
such <span class="lock">articles:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was put to a carriage-lamp maker,” the
man said, “at Birmingham, but soon ran away.
Nobody saw after me, for I had only an uncle,
and he left me to the parish. It was all my
own fault. I was always after some idle end,
though I can read very well. It seems as if I
couldn’t help it, being wild, I mean. I ran away
to Worcester, <i>without knowing where I was going,
or caring either</i>. I was half starved in Worcester,
for I lived as I could. I found my way
to London afterwards. I’ve been in the streets
ever since, at one thing or the other; how many
years I can’t say. Time goes so quick sometimes,
and sometimes so slow, and I’m never long in one
place. I’ve sold braces off and on ever since
Amato won the Derby, if you know when that
was. I remember it because I went to Epsom
races that year to sell race cards. When I came
to London after the races I laid out 12<i>s.</i> in braces.
I hardly remember how many pairs I bought for
it, but they wasn’t such common things as I’m
carrying now. I could sell a few then at from 9<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a pair, to the ‘cads’ and people at such
places as the ‘Elephant,’ and the ‘Flower Pot’ in
Bishopsgate-street, which was a great ‘’bus’ place
then. I used to sell, too, to the helpers in inn-yards,
and a few in the mews. The helpers in the mews
mostly buys knitted cotton. I’ve got 1<i>s.</i> and sometimes
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for an extra article from them, but
now I don’t carry them; there’s no demand there.
You see, many of them work in their shirts, and
the head coachmen and grooms, which is often great
Turks, would blow up if the men had dirty braces
hanging to their buttons, so they uses what’ll
wash. Nearly all my business now is done at
public-houses. I go from one tavern to another on
my round all day long, and sell in the street
when I can. I think I sell as many at 5<i>d.</i> and
at 10<i>d.</i> as at all other prices together, and most at
5<i>d.</i>; but when I have what I call a full stock I
carry ’em from 4<i>d.</i> to 20<i>d.</i> The poorer sort of
people, such as wears braces&mdash;for there’s a many
as does without ’em&mdash;likes the 1<i>d.</i> out of 6<i>d.</i>, and
the others the 2<i>d.</i> out of the 1<i>s.</i>; it tempts them.
It’s a tiresome life, and not so good as costermongering,
for I once did tidy well in apples. But
in the brace trade you ar’n’t troubled with hiring
barrows, and it’s easy carried on in public-houses
in wet weather, and there’s no stock to spoil. I
sell all to working-people, I think. Sometimes an
odd pair or two at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or so, to a tradesman,
that may happen to be in a bar, and likes the look
and the price; or to a gentleman’s servant. I
make from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day; full 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> if I
stick close to it. I may make 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week, too, in selling belts and stockings; but I only
sometimes carry stockings. Perhaps I clear 9<i>s.</i> a
week the year round. There’s lots in the trade
don’t clear 1<i>s.</i> a day, for they only carry low-priced
things. I go for 4<i>d.</i> profit on every shilling’s
worth I sell. I’ve only myself to keep. I pay
3<i>d.</i> a night at a lodging-house, and nothing on
Sundays. I had a young woman with me when I
was a coster, but we didn’t agree, and parted. She
was too fond of lifting her hand to her mouth
(‘tippling’) to please me. I mean to live very
near this week, and get a few shillings if I can to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
try something at Greenwich next Monday.” This
was said on the Tuesday in Passion-week.</p>

<p>The braces are bought by the street-sellers at
the swag-shops I have described. The prices
range from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (for common children’s) to 12<i>s.</i>
a dozen; 3<i>s.</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 7<i>s.</i> being the
most frequent prices. Higher-priced articles are
also sold at the swags and by the street-sellers,
but not one in twenty of these compared with the
lower priced.</p>

<p>In London and its suburbs, and on “rounds,”
of which the metropolis forms the central point,
and at stands, there are, I am assured, not fewer
than 500 persons vending braces. Of these a
twentieth portion may be women, and a tenth old
and sometimes infirm men. There are few children
in the trade. The stall-keepers, selling
braces with other articles, are about 100, and of
the remainder of this class, those who are not
Irishmen are often impoverished mechanics, such
as tailors&mdash;brace-vending being easily resorted to,
and carried on quietly in public-houses, and it does
not entail the necessity of bawling aloud, to which a
working-man, driven to a street-life, usually feels
repugnance. Calculating that 500 brace-sellers
clear 5<i>s.</i> a week each on those articles alone, and
estimating the profit at 33 per cent., it shows a
street expenditure of 3900<i>l.</i> One brace-seller
considered that 500 such sellers was too low a
number; but the most intelligent I met with
agreed on that estimate.</p>

<p>The Belts sold in the street are nearly all
of stout cotton web, “with India-rubber threads,”
and usually of a drab colour, woollen belts being
rarely ever seen now. They are procured in the
same way, and sold by the same parties, as are
braces. The amount expended on belts is, from
the best information I can command, about an
eighth of that expended on braces. The belts are
sold at 1<i>s.</i> each, and cost 8<i>s.</i> the dozen, or 9<i>d.</i>
each, if only one be purchased.</p>

<p>The street-sale of hose used to be far more considerable
than it is now, and was, in a great measure,
in the hands of a class who had personal
claims to notice, independent of the goodness of
their wares. These were old women, wearing,
generally, large white aprons, and chintz-patterned
gowns, and always scrupulously clean. They
carried from door to door, in the quieter streets,
and in the then suburbs, stockings of their “own
knitting.” Such they often were; and those
which were not were still knitted stockings, although
they might be the work of old women in
the country, who knitted by the fireside, needing
no other light on winter evenings and at the
doors of their cottages in the sunshine in summer.
Of these street-sellers some were blind. Between
thirty and forty years ago, I am told, there were
from twelve to twenty blind knitters, but my
informant could not speak with certainty, as
he might probably observe the same women in
different parts. The blind stocking-sellers would
knit at a door as they waited. The informant I
have quoted thought that the last of these knitters
and street-sellers disappeared upwards of twenty
years ago, as he then missed her from his door, at
which she used to make her regular periodical
appearance. The stockings of this trade were
most frequently of white lamb’s-wool, and were
sold at from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> They were long
in the leg, and were suited “for gentle-people’s
winter wear.” The women-sellers made in those
days, I am assured, a comfortable livelihood.</p>

<p>The sale of stockings is now principally in the
hands of the men who vend braces, &amp;c. The kind
sold is most frequently unbleached cotton. The
price to a street-buyer is generally from 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i>;
but the trade is of small extent. “It’s one of
the trades,” a street-seller said to me, “that we
can’t compete with shop-keepers in. You shall
go to a haberdashery swag-shop, and though they
have ‘wholesale haberdashers,’ and ‘hawkers supplied’
on the door-post, you’ll see a pair of stockings
in the window marked with a very big
and very black 6, and a very little and not half
black &frac34;; and if I was to go in, they’d very likely
ask me 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a dozen for an inferior thing.
They retail themselves, and won’t be undersold
if they can help it, and so they don’t care to
accommodate us in things that’s always going.”</p>

<p>A few pairs of women’s stockings are hawked by
women, and sold to servant-maids; but the trade
in these goods, I am informed, including all classes
of sellers&mdash;of whom there may be fifty&mdash;does not
exceed (notwithstanding the universality of the
wear), the receipt of 6<i>s.</i> weekly per individual,
with a profit of from 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>, and an aggregate
expenditure of about 800<i>l.</i> in the year. The
trade is an addition to some other street trade.</p>

<p>The brace-sellers used to carry with their wares
another article, of which India-rubber web formed
the principal part. These were trowser-straps,
“with leather buttonings and ingy-spring bodies.”
It was only, however, the better class of brace-sellers
who carried them; those who, as my informant
expressed it, “had a full stock;” and
their sale was insignificant. At one time, the
number of brace-sellers offering these straps was,
I am informed, from 70 to 100. “It was a poor
trade, sir,” said one of the class. “At first I sold
at 4<i>d.</i>, as they was 6<i>d.</i> in middling shops, and 1<i>s.</i>
in the toppers, if not 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but they soon came
down to 3<i>d.</i>, and then to 2<i>d.</i> My profit was short
of 3<i>d.</i> in 1<i>s.</i> My best customers for braces didn’t
want such things; plain working-men don’t. And
grooms, and stable-keepers generally, wears boots
or knee-gaiters, and footmen sports knee-buckles
and stockings. All I did sell to was, as far as I
can judge, young mechanics as liked to turn out
like gents on a Sunday or an evening, and real
gents that wanted things cheap. I very seldom
cleared more than 1<i>s.</i> a week on them. The
trade’s over now. If you see a few at a stand,
it’s the remains of an old stock, or some that a
swag-shop has pushed out for next to nothing to
be rid of them.”</p>

<p>The sale of waistcoats is confined to Smithfield,
as regards the class I now treat of&mdash;the sellers of
articles made by others. Twelve or fourteen years
back, there was a considerable sale in what was
a branch of duffing. Waistcoats were sold to
countrymen, generally graziers’ servants, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the pretence that they were of fine silk plush,
which was then rather an object of rustic Sunday
finery. A drover told me that a good many years
ago he saw a countryman, with whom he was
conversing at the time, pay 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a “silk
plush waistcoat,” the vendor having asked 15<i>s.</i>,
and having walked away&mdash;no doubt remarking
the eagerness of his victim&mdash;when the countryman
refused to give more than 10<i>s.</i> “He had a customer
set for it,” he said, “at half-a-guinea.” On
the first day the waistcoat was worn&mdash;the drover
was afterwards told by the purchaser&mdash;it was
utterly spoiled by a shower of rain; and when its
possessor asked the village tailor the value of the
garment, he was told that it had no value at all;
the tailor could not even tell what it was made of,
but he never saw anything so badly made in his
life; never. Some little may be allowed for the
natural glee of a village tailor on finding one of
his customers, who no doubt was proud of his
London bargain, completely taken in; but these
waistcoats, I am assured by a tailor who had seen
them, were the veriest rubbish. The trade, however,
has been unknown, unless with a few rare
exceptions at a very busy time&mdash;such as the
market for the show and sale of the Christmas
stock&mdash;since the time specified.</p>

<p>The waistcoats now sold in Smithfield market,
or in the public-houses connected with it, are, I
am told, and also by a tailor, very paltry things;
but the price asked removes the trade from the
imputation of duffing. These garments are sold at
from 1<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each; but very rarely 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
The shilling waistcoats are only fit for boys&mdash;or
“youths,” as the slop-tailors prefer styling them&mdash;but
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is a common price enough; and seven-eighths
of the trade, I am informed, is for prices
under, or not exceeding, 2<i>s.</i> The trade is,
moreover, very small. There are sometimes no
waistcoat-sellers at all; but generally two, and
not unfrequently three. The profits of these men
are 1<i>s.</i> on a bad, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on a good day. As,
at intervals, these street-sellers dispose of a sleeve-waistcoat
(waistcoat with sleeves) at from 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 6<i>s.</i>, we may estimate the average earnings in the
trade at 5<i>s.</i> per market day, or 10<i>s.</i> in the week.
This shows an outlay of 78<i>l.</i> in the year, as the
profits of these street traders may be taken at 33
per cent.; or, as it is almost invariably worded by
such classes, “4<i>d.</i> in the 1<i>s.</i>” The material is of
a kind of cotton made to look as stout as possible,
the back, &amp;c., being the commonest stuff. They
are supplied by a slop-house at the East End, and
are made by women, or rather girls.</p>

<p>The sale of waistcoats in the street, markets,
&amp;c., is of second-hand goods, or otherwise in the
hands of a distinct class. There are other belts,
and other portions of wearing apparel, which,
though not of textile fabrics, as they are often
sold by the same persons as I have just treated of,
may be described here. These are children’s
“patent leather” belts, trowser-straps, and garters.</p>

<p>The sellers of children’s and men’s belts and
trowser-straps are less numerous than they were,
for both these things, I am told, but only on street
authority, are going out of fashion. From one
elderly man who had “dropped belts, and straps,
and all that, for oranges,” I heard bitter complaints
of the conduct of the swag shop-keepers
who supplied these wares. The substance of his
garrulous and not very lucid complaint was that
when boys’ patent leather belts came into fashion,
eleven, twelve, or thirteen years back, he could
not remember which, the usual price in the shops
was 1<i>s.</i>, and they were soon to be had in the
streets for 6<i>d.</i> each. The belt-sellers “did well”
for a while. But the “swags” who, according to
my informant, at first supplied belts of patent
horse-leather, came to substitute patent sheep-leather
for them, which were softer, and looked as
well. The consequence was, that whenever the
sheep-leather belts were wet, or when there was
any “pull” upon them, they stretched, and “the
polish went to cracks.” After having been wet a
few times, too, they were easily torn, and so the
street trade became distrusted. It was the same
with trowser-straps.</p>

<p>The belt trade is now almost extinct in the
streets, and the strap trade, which was chiefly in
the hands of old and infirm, and young people, is
now confined to the sellers of dog-collars, &amp;c. The
trowser-straps are not glazed or patent-leather, now,
but “plain calf;” sold at 2<i>d.</i> a pair generally, and
bought at from 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> the dozen pairs.
Many readers will remember how often they used
to hear the cry, “Three pair for sixpence! Three pair
for sixpence!” A cry now, I believe, never heard.</p>

<p>Among the belt and strap-sellers were some
blind persons. One man counted to me three blind
men whom he knew selling them, and one sells
them still, attached to the rails by St. Botolph’s
church, Bishopsgate.</p>

<p>The same persons who sold straps, &amp;c., not including
the present sellers, the dog-collar men, &amp;c.,
had lately no small traffic in the vending of garters.
The garter-sellers were, however, far more numerous
than ever were the strap-sellers. At one
time, I am told, there were 200 garter sellers; all
old or infirm, or poor women, or children, and
chiefly Irish children. As these children were
often stockingless and shoeless, their cry of “Penny
a pair! India-rubber garters, penny a pair!” was
sometimes pitiful enough, as they were offering a
cheap article, unused by themselves. The sudden
influx of garters, so to speak, was owing, I am
told, to a manufacturer having discovered a cheap
way of “working the India-rubber threads,” and
having “thrown a lot into the market through the
swag shops.” The price was at first 8<i>s.</i> a gross
(8<i>d.</i> a dozen), but as the demand increased, it was
raised to 9<i>s.</i> and 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The trade continued
about six weeks, but has now almost entirely
ceased. The stock of garters still offered for sale
is what stall-keepers have on hand, or what swag
shop-keepers tempt street-sellers to buy by reducing
the price. The leather garter-trade, 1<i>d.</i> a
pair being the usual price for sheep-skin garters, is
now almost unknown. It was somewhat extensive.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Boot and Stay-Laces,
&amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>Like many street-callings which can be started on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the smallest means, and without any previous
knowledge of the article sold being necessary to
the street-vendor, the boot and stay-lace trade
has very many followers. I here speak of those
who <i>sell</i> boot-laces, and subsist, or endeavour to
subsist, by the sale, without mixing it up with
begging. The majority, indeed the great majority,
of these street traders are women advanced in
years, and, perhaps, I may say the whole of them
are very poor. An old woman said to me, “I
just drag on, sir, half-starving on a few boot-laces,
rather than go into the workhouse, and I know
numbers doing the same.”</p>

<p>The laces are bought at the haberdashery swag-shops
I have spoken of, and amongst these old
women I found the term “swag-shop” as common
as among men who buy largely at such establishments.
The usual price for boot-laces to
be sold in the streets is 1<i>d.</i> a dozen. Each lace
is tagged at both ends, sufficing for a pair of boots.
The regular retail price is three a penny, but the
lace-sellers are not unfrequently compelled to give
four, or lose a customer. A better quality is sold
at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> a dozen, but these are seldom meddled
with by the street lace-sellers. It is often a
matter of strong endeavour for a poor woman to
make herself mistress of 11<i>d.</i>, the whole of which
she can devote to the purchase of boot-laces, as
for 11<i>d.</i> she can procure a gross, so saving 1<i>d.</i> in
twelve dozen.</p>

<p>The stay-laces, which are bought at the same
places, and usually sold by the same street-traders,
are 2<i>d.</i> and 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> the dozen. I am told that there
are as many of the higher as of the lower priced
stay-laces bought for street sale, “because,” one
of the street-sellers told me “there’s a great many
servant girls, and others too, that’s very particular
about their stay-laces.” The stay-laces are retailed
at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p>These articles are vended at street-stalls, along
with other things for female use; but the most
numerous portion of the lace-sellers are itinerant,
walking up and down a street market, or going on
a round in the suburbs, calling at every house
where they are known, or where, as one woman
expressed it, “we make bold to venture.” Those
frequenting the street-markets, or other streets or
thoroughfares, usually carry the boot-laces in their
hands, and the stay-laces round their necks, and
offer them to the females passing. Their principal
customers are the working-classes, the wives and
daughters of small shop-keepers, and servant-maids.
“Ladies, of course,” said one lace-seller, “won’t
buy of us.” Another old woman whom I questioned
on the subject, and who had sold laces for
about fourteen years, gave me a similar account;
but she added:&mdash;“I’ve sold to high-up people
though. Only two or three weeks back, a fine-dressed
servant maid stopped me and said, ‘Here,
I must have a dozen boot-laces for mistress, and
she says, she’ll only give 3<i>d.</i> for them, as it’s a
dozen at once. A mean cretur she is. It’s grand
doings before faces, and pinchings behind backs,
at our house.’”</p>

<p>Among the lace-sellers having rounds in the
suburbs are some who “have known better
days.” One old woman had been companion and
housekeeper to a lady, who died in her arms, and
whose legacy to her companion-servant enabled
her to furnish a house handsomely. This she
let out in apartments at “high-figures,” and anything
like a regular payment by her lodgers would
have supplied her with a comfortable maintenance.
But fine gentlemen, and fine ladies too, went away
in her debt; she became involved, her furniture
was seized, and step by step she was reduced to
boot-lace selling. Her appearance is still that of
“the old school;” she wears a very large bonnet of
faded black silk, a shawl of good material, but old
and faded, and always a black gown. The poor
woman told me that she never ventured to call
even at the houses where she was best received if
she saw any tax-gatherer go to or from the house:
“I know very well what it is,” she continued,
“it’s no use my calling; they’re sure to be cross,
and the servants will be cross too, because their
masters or mistresses are cross with them. If the
tax-gatherer’s not paid, they’re cross at being
asked; if he is paid, they’re cross at having had
to part with their money. I’ve paid taxes myself.”</p>

<p>The dress of the boot lace-sellers generally is
that of poor elderly women, for the most part perhaps
a black chip, or old straw bonnet (often
broken) and a dark-coloured cotton gown. Their
abodes are in the localities in all parts of the metropolis,
which I have frequently specified as the
abodes of the poor. They live most frequently in
their own rooms, but the younger, and perhaps I
may add, coarser, of the number, resort to lodging-houses.
It is not very uncommon, I was told
by one of the class, for two poor women, boot-lace
sellers or in some similar line, “to join” in a room,
so saving half the usual rent of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for an
unfurnished room. This arrangement, however, is
often of short duration. There is always arising
some question, I was told, about the use or wear of
this utensil or the other, or about washing, or about
wood and coals, if one street-seller returned an
hour or two before her companion. This is not to
be wondered at, when we bear in mind that to
these people every farthing is of consequence.
From all that I can learn, the boot-lace sellers (I
speak of the women) are poor and honest, and
that, as a body, they are little mixed up with dishonest
characters and dishonest ways. The exceptions
are, I understand, among some hale persons,
such as I have alluded to as sojourning in
the lodging-houses. Some of these traders receive
a little parochial relief.</p>

<p>One intelligent woman could count up 100 persons
depending chiefly upon the sale of boot and
stay-laces, in what she called her own neighbourhood.
This comprised Leather-lane, Holborn,
Tottenham Court-road, the Hampstead-road, and
all the adjacent streets. From the best data at
my command, I believe there are not fewer than
500 individuals <i>selling</i> these wares in London.
Several lace-sellers agreed in stating that they sold
a dozen boot-laces a-day, and a dozen stay-laces,
and 2 dozen extra on Saturday nights; but the
drawbacks of bad weather, &amp;c., reduce the average
sale to not more than 6 dozen a week, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>1,872,000
boot-laces in a year, at an outlay to the public of
3,900<i>l.</i> yearly; from a half to three-fourths of the
receipts being the profit of the street-sellers.</p>

<p>The same quantity of stay-laces sold at 6<i>d.</i> a
dozen shows an outlay of 3,900<i>l.</i>, with about an
equally proportional profit to the sellers.</p>

<p>Most of these traders sell tapes and other articles
as well as laces. The tapes cost 3<i>d.</i> and
3&frac12;<i>d.</i> the dozen, and are sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i> a knot. A
dozen in 2 days is an average sale, but I have
treated more expressly of those who depend principally
upon boot-lace selling for their livelihood.
Their average profits are about 3<i>s.</i> a week, on
laces alone. The trade, I am told, was much
more remunerative a few years back, and the decline
was attributed “to so many getting into the
trade, and the button boots becoming as fashionable
as the Adelaides.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Blind Female Seller of “Small-Wares.”</span></h3>

<p>I now give an account of the street-trade, the
feelings, and the life of a poor blind woman, who
may be seen nearly every fine day, selling what
is technically termed “small-ware,” in Leather-lane,
Holborn. The street “small-wares” are now
understood to be cotton-tapes, pins, and sewing
cotton; sometimes with the addition of boot and
stay-laces, and shirt-buttons.</p>

<p>I saw the blind small-ware seller enter her own
apartment, which was on the first floor of a small
house in a court contiguous to her “pitch.” The
entrance into the court was low and narrow; a
tall man would be compelled to stoop as he entered
the passage leading into the court. Here were
unmistakeable signs of the poverty of the inhabitants.
Soapsuds stood in the choked gutter, old
clothes were hung out to dry across the court, one
side being a dead wall, and the windows were
patched with paper, sometimes itself patched with
other paper. In front of one window, however,
was a rude gate-work, behind which stood a root
of lavender, and a campanula, thriving not at all,
but yet, with all their dinginess, presenting a relief
to the eye.</p>

<p>The room of the blind woman is reached by a
very narrow staircase, on which two slim persons
could not pass each other, and up old and worn
stairs. Her apartment may be about ten feet
square. The window had both small and large
panes, with abundance of putty plastering. The
furniture consisted of a small round deal table (on
which lay the poor woman’s stock of black and
white tapes, of shirt-buttons, &amp;c.), and of four
broken or patched chairs. There were a few
motley-looking “pot” ornaments on the mantel-shelf,
in the middle of which stood a doctor’s
bottle. The bust of a female was also conspicuous,
as was a tobacco-pipe. Above the mantel-piece
hung some pictureless frames, while a pair of spectacles
were suspended above a little looking-glass.
Over a cupboard was a picture of the Ethiopian
serenaders, and on the uncoloured walls were
engravings of animals apparently from some work
on natural history. There were two thin beds, on
one of which was stowed a few costermonger’s old
baskets and old clothes (women’s and boys’), as if
stowed away there to make room to stir about.
All the furniture was dilapidated. An iron rod
for a poker, a pair of old tongs, and a sheet-iron
shovel, were by the grate, in which glimmered a
mere handful of fire. All showed poverty. The
rent was 1<i>s.</i> a week (it had been 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>), and the
blind woman and a lodger (paying 6<i>d.</i> of the rent)
slept in one bed, while a boy occupied the other.
A wiry-haired dog, neither handsome nor fat,
received a stranger (for the blind woman, and her
guide and lodger, left their street trade at my
request for their own room) with a few querulous
yelps, which subsided into a sort of whining welcome
to me, when the animal saw his mistress
was at ease. The pleasure with which this poor
woman received and returned the caresses of her
dog was expressed in her face. I may add that
owing to a change of street names in that neighbourhood,
I had some difficulty in finding the
small-ware seller, and heard her poor neighbours
speak well of her as I inquired her abode; usually
a good sign among the poor.</p>

<p>The blind tape-seller is a tall and somewhat
strongly-formed woman, with a good-humoured
and not a melancholy expression of face, though
her manner was exceedingly quiet and subdued
and her voice low. Her age is about 50. She
wore, what I understand is called a “half-widow’s
cap;” this was very clean, as indeed was her
attire generally, though worn and old.</p>

<p>I have already given an account of a female
small-ware seller (which account formerly appeared
in one of my letters in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>)
strongly illustrating the vicissitudes of a street
life. It was the statement, however, of one who
is no longer in the streets, and the account given
by the blind tape and pin seller is further interesting
as furnishing other habitudes or idiosyncracies
of the blind (or of an individual blind woman), in
addition to those before detailed; more especially
in its narrative of the feelings of a perhaps not
very sensitive woman who became “dark” (as she
always called it) in mature age.</p>

<p>“It’s five years, sir,” she said, “since I have
been quite dark, but for two years before that I
had lost the sight of one eye. Oh, yes, I had
doctors but they couldn’t save my eyesight. I
lost it after illnesses and rheumatics, and from want
and being miserable. I felt <i>very</i> miserable when
I first found myself quite dark, as if everything
was lost to me. I felt as if I’d no more place in
the world; but one gets reconciled to most things,
thank God, in time; but I’m often low and sad
now. Living poorly and having a sickly boy to
care about may be one reason, as well as my
blindness and being so bad off.</p>

<p>“I was brought up to service, and was sent
before that to St. Andrew’s school. I lost my
parents and friends (relatives) when I were young.
I was in my first place eighteen months, and was
eight or nine years in service altogether, mostly as
maid of all work. I saved a little money and
married. My husband was a costermonger, and
we didn’t do well. Oh, dear no, sir, because he
was addicted to drinking. We often suffered great
pinching. I can’t say as he was unkind to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
He died nine years or more since. After that I
supported myself, and two sons we had, by going
out to wash and ‘chair.’ I did that when my
husband was living. I had tidy work, as I ‘chaired’
and washed for one family in Clerkenwell for ten
years, and might again if I wasn’t dark. My
eldest son’s now a soldier and is with his regiment
at Dover. He’s only eighteen, but he could
get nothing to do as hard as he tried; I couldn’t
help him; he knew no trade; and so he ’listed.
Poor fellow! perhaps I shall never see him again.
Oh, <i>see</i> him! That I couldn’t if he was sitting
as near me as you are, sir; but perhaps I may
never hear his voice again. Perhaps he’ll have
to go abroad and be killed. It’s a sad thought
that for a blind widow; I think of it both up and
in bed. Blind people thinks a great deal, I feel
they does. My youngest son&mdash;he’s now fourteen&mdash;is
asthmatical; but he’s such a good lad, so
easily satisfied. He likes to read if he can get
hold of a penny book, and has time to read it.
He’s at a paper-stainer’s and works on fancy
satin paper, which is very obnicious” (the word
she used twice for pernicious or obnoxious) “to
such a delicate boy. He has 5<i>s.</i> a week, but,
oh dear me, it takes all that for his bit of clothes,
and soap for washing, and for shoes, and then he
must carry his dinner with him every day, which
I makes ready, and as he has to work hard,
poor thing, he requires a little meat. I often frets
about his being so weakly; often, as I stands with
my tapes and pins, and thinks, and thinks. But,
thank God, I can still wash for him and myself,
and does so regularly. No, I can’t clean my room
myself, but a poor woman who lives by selling
boot-laces in the streets has lodged with me for
many years, and she helps me.”</p>

<p>“Lives!” interrupted the poor boot-lace woman,
who was present, “starves, you mean; for
all yesterday I only took a farthing. But anything’s
better than the house. I’ll live on 4<i>d.</i> a
day, and pay rent and all, and starve half my
time, rather nor the great house” (the Union).</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” resumed the blind woman, “for
when I first went dark, I was forced to send to
my parish, and had 6<i>d.</i> twice a week, and a half-quartern
loaf, and that was only allowed for three
weeks, and then there was the house for me. Oh
dear, after that I didn’t know what I could do to
get a bit of bread. At first I was so frightened
and nervous, I was afraid of every noise. That
was when I was quite dark; and I am often
frightened at nothing still, and tremble as I stand
in the lane. I was at first greatly distressed, and
in pain, and was very down-hearted. I was so
put about that I felt as if I was a burden to
myself, and to everybody else. If you lose your
sight as I did, sir, when you’re not young, it’s a
long time <i>before you learns to be blind</i>. [So she
very expressly worded it.] A friend advised me
to sell tapes and cottons, and boot-laces, in the
street, as better than doing nothing; and so I did.
But at first I was sure every minute I should be
run on. The poor woman that lodges with me
bought some things for me where she buys her
own&mdash;at Albion-house, in the Borough. O, I
does very badly in my trade, very badly. I now
clear only 2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, or 4<i>d.</i> a day; no, I think not
more than 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week; that is all. Why, one
day this week I only sold a ha’porth of pins.
But what I make more than pays my rent, and
it’s a sort of employment; something to do, and
make one feel one’s not quite idle. I hopes to
make more now that nights are getting long, for I
can then go into the lane (Leather-lane) of an
evening, and make 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> extra. I daren’t
go out when it’s long dark evenings, for the boys
teases me, and sometimes comes and snatches my
tapes and things out of my hands, and runs away,
and leaves me there robbed of my little stock.
I’m sure I don’t know whether it’s young thieves
as does it, or for what they calls a lark. I only
knows I loses my tapes. Do I complain to the
police, do you say, sir? I don’t know when a
policeman’s passing, in such a crowded place. Oh
yes, I could get people to complain for me, but
perhaps it would be no good; and then I’m afraid
of the police; they’re so arbitry. [Her word.]
It’s not very long since one of them&mdash;and I was
told afterwards he was a sergeant, too&mdash;ordered
me to move on. ‘I can’t move on, sir,’ said I, ‘I
wish I could, but I must stand still, for I’m blind.’
‘I know that,’ says he, ‘but you’re begging.’
‘No, I’m not,’ says I, ‘I’m only a trying to sell a
few little things, to keep me out of the work’us.’
‘Then what’s that thing you have tied over your
breast?’ says he. ‘If you give me any more of
your nonsense, I’ll lock you up;’ and then he
went away. I’m terrified to think of being taken
to the station.”</p>

<p>The matter which called forth the officer’s
wrath, was a large card, tied from the poor
woman’s shoulders, on which was printed, in
large letters, “PLEASE TO BUY OF THE
POOR BLIND.” “Ay,” said the blind woman’s
companion, with a bitterness not uncommon
on the part of street-sellers on such occasions,
“and any shopkeeper can put what notice he likes
in his window, that he can, if it’s ever such a lie,
and nothing’s said if <i>he</i> collects a crowd; oh dear,
no. But <i>we</i> mus’n’t say our lives is our own.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the blind woman, as I questioned
her further, “there I stands, and often feels
as if I was half asleep, or half dreaming; and I
sometimes hardly knows when I dreams, and
what I thinks; and I think what it was like
when I had my eyesight and was among them,
and what it would be like if I had my eyesight
again; all those people making all that noise, and
trying to earn a penny, seems so queer. And I
often thinks if people suffered ever so much, they
had something to be thankful for, if they had
their eyesight. If I’d been dark from a child, I
think I shouldn’t have felt it so much. It wouldn’t
have been like all that lost, and I should be
handier, though I’m not bad that way as it is,
but I’m afraid to go out by myself. Where I
lives there’s so many brokers about, I should
run against their furniture. I’m sometimes not
spoken to for an hour and more. Many a
day I’ve only took 1<i>d.</i> Then I thinks and
mopes about what will become of me, and thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
about my children. I don’t know who buys of
me, but I’m sure I’m very thankful to all as
does. They takes the things out of my hands,
and puts the money into them. I think they’re
working-people as buys of me, but I can’t be sure.
Some speaks to me very kind and pleasant. I
don’t think they’re ladies that speaks kind. My
husband used to say that if ladies went to places
like the Lane, it was on the sly, to get something
cheap, and they did’nt want to be seen there, or
they might be counted low. I’m sure he was
right. And it ain’t such as them as buys of a poor
blind woman out of kindness. No, sir, it’s very
seldom indeed that I get more than the regular
price. A halfpenny a knot for my tapes; and a
halfpenny and a farthing for pins; and a halfpenny
and a penny a dozen for shirt-buttons;
and three a penny when I sells boot-laces; and a
halfpenny a piece when I has stay-laces. I sells
good things, I know, for the friend as gets them
wouldn’t deceive me, and I never has no complaints
of them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any other blind woman in the
trade besides myself. No, I don’t associate with
blind people. I wasn’t brought up, like, to such a
thing, but am in it by accident. I can’t say how
many blind women there may be in my line in the
streets. I haven’t the least notion. I took little
notice of them, God forgive me, when I had my
eyesight, and I haven’t been thrown among them
since. Whether there’s many of them or not,
they’re all to be pitied.</p>

<p>“On a Sunday I never stirs out, except to
chapel, with my lodger or my son. No, sir, not a
Roman Catholic chapel, but a Protestant. When
it’s not very fine weather we goes to the nearest,
but you hears nothing but what’s good in any of
them. Oh dear, no.</p>

<p>“I lives on tea and bread and butter all the
week&mdash;yes, I can make it ready myself&mdash;except
on Sundays, when my son has his dinner here,
and we has a bit of cheap meat; not often fish;
it’s troublesome. If bread and things wasn’t
cheap I couldn’t live at all, and it’s hardly living
as it is. What <i>can</i> any one do on all that I can
earn? There’s so many in the streets, I’m told,
in my line, and distress drives more and more
every week&mdash;everybody says so, and wages is so
bad, and there’s such under-selling, that I don’t
know whatever things will come to. I’ve no
’spectation of anything better in the time that
has to come, nothing but misery, God help me.
But I’m sure I should soon fret to death in a
work’us.”</p>

<p>The poor woman lodging with the blind street-seller
is herself in the same trade, but doing most
in boot and stay-laces. She has a sharp and
pinched outline of countenance, as if from poverty
of diet, and is indeed wretchedly poor, earning
only about 6<i>d.</i> a day, if so much. She is about
the same age as her landlady, or somewhat younger,
and has apparently been good-looking, and has
still an intelligent expression. She lodged with
the blind woman during her husband’s lifetime,
when he rented two rooms, letting her one, and
she had lived with the present widow in this way
about fourteen years. She speaks cheerfully and
seems an excellent companion for a blind person.
On my remarking that they could neither of them
be very cross-tempered to have lived so long together,
the lodger said, laughingly, “O, we have a
little tiff now and then, sir, as women will, you
know; but it’s not often, and we soon are all
right again. Poor people like us has something
else to think of than tiffs and gossipping.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Blind Street-Seller of Boot-Laces.</span></h3>

<p>The character, thoughts, feelings, regrets, and
even the dreams, of a very interesting class of
street-folk&mdash;the blind&mdash;are given in the narratives
I now proceed to lay before the reader, from blind
street-folk; but a few words of general introduction
are necessary.</p>

<p>It may be that among the uneducated&mdash;among
those whose feelings and whose bodies have been
subjected to what may be called the wear and tear
of poverty and privation&mdash;there is a tendency, even
when misfortunes the most pitiable and undeserved
have been encountered, to fall from misery into
mendicancy. Even the educated, or, as the street
people more generally describe them, those “who
have seen better days,” sometimes, after the ordeal
of the streets and the low lodging-houses, become
trading mendicants. Among such people there
may be, in one capacity or other, the ability and
sometimes the opportunity to labour, and yet&mdash;whether
from irrepressible vagabondism, from
utter repugnance to any <i>settled</i> mode of subsistence
(caused either by the natural disposition of the
individual, or by the utter exhaustion of mind and
body driving him to beg)&mdash;yet, I say, men of this
class become beggars and even “lurkers.”</p>

<p>As this is the case with men who have the exercise
of their limbs, and of the several senses of
the body, there must be some mitigating plea, if
not a full justification, in the conduct of those who
beg directly or indirectly, because they <i>cannot</i> and
perhaps <i>never could</i> labour for their daily bread&mdash;I
allude to those afflicted with blindness, whether
“from their youth up” or from the calamity being
inflicted upon them in maturer years.</p>

<p>By the present law, for a blind man to beg is to
be amenable to punishment, and to be subjected
to perhaps the bitterest punishment which can be
put upon him&mdash;imprisonment; to a deprivation of
what may be his chief solace&mdash;the enjoyment of
the fresh air; and to a rupture of the feeling,
which cannot but be comforting to such a man,
that under his infirmity he still has the sympathies
of his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>It appears to me, then, that the blind have a
right to ask charity of those whom God has
spared so terrible an affliction, and who in the
terms best understood by the destitute themselves,
are “well to do;” those whom&mdash;in the canting
language of a former generation of blind and other
beggars&mdash;“Providence has blessed with affluence.”
This right to solicit aid from those to whom such
aid does not even approach to the sacrifice of any
idle indulgence&mdash;to say nothing of any necessary
want&mdash;is based on their helplessness, but lapses if
it becomes a mere business, and with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
trickiness by which a street business is sometimes
characterised.</p>

<p>On this question of moral right, as of political
expediency, I quote an authority which must command
attention, that of Mr. Stuart <span class="lock">Mill:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Apart from any metaphysical considerations
respecting the foundation of morals or of the social
union, he says, “It will be admitted to be right,
that human beings should help one another; and
the more so, in proportion to the urgency of the
need; and none needs help so urgently as one who
is starving. The claim to help, therefore, created
by destitution, is one of the strongest which can
exist; and there is <i>primâ facie</i> the amplest reason
for making the relief of so extreme an exigency as
certain, to those who require it, as, by any arrangements
of society, it can be made.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, in all cases of helping,
there are two sets of consequences to be considered;
the consequences of the assistance itself, and the
consequences of relying on the assistance. The
former are generally beneficial, but the latter for
the most part injurious; so much so, in many cases,
as greatly to outweigh the value of the benefit.
And this is never more likely to happen than in
the very cases where the need of help is the most
intense. There are few things for which it is
more mischievous, that people should rely on the
habitual aid of others, than for the means of subsistence,
and unhappily there is no lesson which
they more easily learn.” I may here mention, in
corroboration of this statement, that I was told by
an experienced parochial officer, that there was
truth in the saying, “Once a pauper, and always
a pauper;” which seems to show that the lesson of
relying on the habitual aid of others may not only
be learned with ease, but is forgotten with difficulty.
“The problem to be solved,” continues Mr.
Mill, “is, therefore, one of peculiar nicety, as well
as importance; how to give the greatest amount of
needful help, with the smallest encouragement to
undue reliance on it.</p>

<p>“Energy and self-dependence are, however,” Mr.
Mill proceeds to argue, and, in this respect, it
seems to me, to argue to demonstration, “liable to
be impaired by <i>the absence of help, as well as by its
excess. It is even more fatal to exertion to have
no hope of succeeding by it, than to be assured of
succeeding without it.</i> When the condition of any
one is so disastrous that his energies are paralyzed
by discouragement, assistance is a tonic, not a
sedative: it braces, instead of relaxing the active
faculties: always provided that the assistance is
not such as to dispense with self-help, by substituting
itself for the person’s own labour, skill, and
prudence, but is limited to affording him a better
hope of attaining success by those legitimate
means. This, accordingly, is a test to which all
plans of philanthropy and benevolence should be
brought, whether intended for the benefit of individuals
or of classes, and whether conducted on the
voluntary or on the government principle.</p>

<p>“In so far as the subject admits of any general
doctrine or maxim, it would appear to be this&mdash;<i>that
if assistance is given in such a manner that
the condition of the person helped is rendered
as desirable as that of another</i> (in a similar
grade of society) <i>who succeeds in maintaining
himself without help, the assistance, if systematic
and capable of being previously calculated upon,
is <span class="smcap lowercase">MISCHIEVOUS</span>: but if, while available to everybody,
it leaves to all a strong motive to do without
it if they can, it is then for the most part <span class="smcap lowercase">BENEFICIAL</span>.</i>”</p>

<p>That the workhouse should bring less comfort
and even greater irksomeness and restraint to any
able-bodied inmate, than is felt by the poorest
agricultural labourer in the worst-paid parts of the
country, or the most wretched slop tailor, or shoe-maker,
or cabinet maker in London, who supports
himself by his own labour, is, I think, a sound
principle. However wretched the ploughman
may be in his hut, or the tailor in his garret, he is
what I have heard underpaid mechanics call, still
“his own man.” He is supported by his labour;
he has escaped the indignity of a reliance on others.</p>

<p>I need not now enter into the question whether
or not the workhouse system has done more harm
than good. Some harm it is assuredly doing, for its
over-discipline drives people to beg rather than
apply for parish relief; and so the public are
twice mulct, by having to pay compulsorily, in the
form of poor’s-rate, and by being induced to give
voluntarily, because they feel that the applicant
for their assistance deserves to be helped.</p>

<p>But although the dogma I have cited, respecting
the condition of those in a workhouse, may be
sound in principle as regards the able-bodied, how
does it apply to those who are not able-bodied?
To those who <i>cannot</i> work? And above all how
does it apply to those to whom nature has denied
even the capacity to labour? To the blind, for
instance? Yet the blind man, who dreads the injustice
of such a creed applied to his misfortune,
is subject to the punishment of the mendacious
beggar, should he ask a passer-by to pity his
afflictions. The law may not often be enforced,
but sometimes it is enforced&mdash;perhaps more frequently
in country than in town&mdash;and surely it is
so enforced against abstract right and political
morality. The blind beggar, “worried by the
police,” as I have heard it described, becomes the
mendacious beggar, no longer asking, in honesty,
for a mite to which a calamity that no prudence
could have saved him gave him a fair claim, but
resorting to trick in order to increase his precarious
gains.</p>

<p>That the blind resort to deceitful representations
is unquestionable. One blind man, I am
informed, said to Mr. Child the oculist, when he
offered to couch him, “Why, that would ruin me!”
And there are many, I am assured, who live by
the streets who might have their eyesight restored,
but who will not.</p>

<p>The public, however, must be warned to distinguish
between those determined beggars and the
really deserving and helpless blind. To allow
their sympathies to be blunted against <i>all</i>, because
some are bad, is a creed most consolatory to
worldly successful selfishness, and alien to every
principle of pure morals, as well as to that of more
than morals&mdash;the spirit of Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The feelings of the blind, apart from their mere
sufferings as poor men, are well described in some
of the narratives I give, and the account of a
blind man’s dreams is full of interest. Man is
blessed with the power of seeing dreams, it should
be remembered, <i>visionally</i>; but the blind man, to
whose statement I invite attention, dreams, it
will be seen, like the rest of his fraternity, through
the sense of hearing, or of feeling, best known as
“touching;” that is to say, by audible or tactile
representations.</p>

<p>Some of the poor blind, he told me, are polishers’
wheel-turners, but there is not employment for one
in one hundred at this. My informant only knew
two so engaged. People, he says, are glad to do it,
and will work at as low wages as the blind. Some
of the blind, too, blow blacksmiths’ forges at foundries;
others are engaged as cutlers’ wheel-turners.
“There was one talking to me the other day,
and he said he’d get me a job that way.” Others
again turn mangles, but at this there is little employment
to be had. Another blind acquaintance
of my informant’s chops chaff for horses. Many of
the blind are basket-makers, learning the business
at the blind school, but one-half, I am told, can’t
make a living at this, after leaving the school;
they can’t do the work so neatly, and waste more
rods than the other workers. Other blind people
are chair-bottomers, and others make rope
mats with a frame, but all of these can scarcely
make a living. Many blind people play church
organs. Some blind men are shoemakers, but
their work is so inferior, it is almost impossible to
live by it.</p>

<p>The blind people are forced to the streets because,
they say, they can do nothing else to get a living;
at no trade, even if they know one, can they get a
living, for they are not qualified to work against
those who can see; and what’s more, labourers’
wages are so low that people can get a man with
his eyesight at the same price as they could live
upon. “There’s many a blind basket-weaver
playing music in the streets ’cause he can’t get
work. At the trade I know one blind basket-maker
can make 15<i>s.</i> a-week at his trade, but
then he has a good connection and works for hisself;
the work all comes home. He couldn’t make
half that working for a shop. At turning wheels
there’s nothing to be done; there’s so many
seeing men out of employment that’s glad to do
the work at the same price as the blind, so that
unless the blind will go into the workhouse, they
must fly to the streets. The police, I am told,
treat the blind very differently: some of the force
are very good to them, and some has no feeling
at all&mdash;they shove them about worse than dogs;
but the police is just like other men, good and
bad amongst them. They’re very kind to me,”
said my blind informant, “and they have a difficult
duty to perform, and some persons, like Colonel
Cavendish, makes them harsher to us than they
would be.” I inquired whether my blind informant
had received one of the Census papers to fill up,
and he told me that he had heard nothing about
them, and that he had certainly made no return
to the government about his blindness; but what
it was to the government whether he was blind
or not, he couldn’t tell. His wife was blind as
well as himself, and there was another blind man
living in his room, and none of his blind friends,
that he had heard of, had ever received any of the
papers.</p>

<p>“Some blind people in the streets carry laces.
There are some five men and one woman at the
West-end do this, and three of these have dogs
to lead them; one stands always on Langham-place.
One carries cabbage-nets, he is an old man of
seventy year, with white hair, and is likewise led
by a dog. Another carries matches (he has a
large family), and he is often led by one of his
boys. There is a blind woman who always sits
by the Polytechnic, and has indeed done so since
it was built. She gets her living by sewing,
making caps and things for ladies. Another
blind woman obtains a livelihood by knitting
garters and covers for bread trays and backs of
chairs. She generally walks about in the neighbourhood
of Baker-street, and Portman-square.
Many recite a lamentation as they go along, but
in many parts of London the police will not allow
them to do so.</p>

<p>“It’s a very jealous place, is London. The
police is so busy; but many recites the lamentation
for all that. It’s a feeling thing&mdash;Oh,
they’re very touching words.”</p>

<p>The greater part in the streets are musicians;
five to one are, or ten to one. My informant
thinks, last Thursday week, there were
seven blind musicians all playing through the
streets together in one band. There are four
living in York-court; two in Grafton-court; two
in Clement’s-lane; one in Orchard-place; two in
Gray’s-buildings; two in Half-Moon-street, in
the City, and two in a court hard by; one up by
Ball’s-pond; two in Rose-court, Whitechapel; three
in Golden-lane; two at Chelsea; three in Westminster;
one up at Paddington; one (woman) in
Marylebone; one in Westminster; one in Gray’s-inn-lane;
one in Whitechapel: in all thirty-one;
but my informant was satisfied there must be at
least as many more, or sixty blind musicians
in all.</p>

<p>In the course of a former inquiry into the character
and condition of street performers, I received
the following account from a blind <span class="lock">musician:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The street blind tried, some years back, to
maintain a burying and sick club of our own;
but we were always too poor. We live in
rooms. I don’t know one blind musician who
lives in a lodging-house. I myself know a dozen
blind men now performing in the streets of London.
The blind musicians are chiefly married
men. I don’t know one who lives with a woman
unmarried. The loss of sight changes a man, he
doesn’t think of women, and women don’t think
of him. We are of a religious turn, too, generally.</p>

<p>“When we agreed to form the blind club there
was not more than a dozen members. These
consisted of two basket-makers; one mat-maker;
four violin players; myself; and my two mates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and this was the number when it dropped for
want of funds; that’s now sixteen years ago.
We were to pay 1<i>s.</i> a month, and sick members
were to have 5<i>s.</i> a week when they had paid two
years. Our other rules were the same as other
clubs. There’s a good many blind who play at
sailors dances, Wapping and Deptford way. We
seldom hire children to lead us in the streets;
we have plenty of our own generally. I have
five. Our wives are generally women that have
their eyesight; but some blind men marry blind
women.”</p>

<p>My informant was satisfied that there were
at least 100 blind men and women getting
their living in the streets, and about 500 throughout
the country. There are many who stay continually
in Brighton, Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham,
Manchester, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Plymouth,
and indeed all large towns. “There are a great many
blind people, I am told,” he said, “in Cornwall.
It’s such a humane place for them; the people has
great feeling for the blind; they’re very religious
there, and a many lose their sight in the mines,
and that’s what makes them have a feeling for
others so.” This man heard a calculation made
some time back, that there were 5000 blind people,
including those in schools and asylums, within five
miles round St. Paul’s. The most of the blind have
lost their sight by the small-pox&mdash;nine out of
every ten of the musicians have done so; since
the vaccination has been discovered, I am told the
cases of blindness from small-pox have been considerably
increased. “Oh, that was a very clever
thing&mdash;very,” said the blind boot-lace seller to me.
Those who have not lost their sight by the small-pox,
have gone blind from accidents, such as substances
thrown or thrust in the eyes, or inflammation
induced from cold and other ailments. My informant
was not acquainted with one blind person in
the streets who had been born blind. One of his
acquaintance who had been blind from birth
caught the small-pox, and obtained his sight after
recovery at eight years old. “The great majority
have lost their sight at an early age&mdash;when mere
children, indeed; they have consequently been
trained to no employment; those few who have”
(my informant knew two) “been educated in
the blind schools as basket-makers, are unable
to obtain employment at this like a seeing person.
Why, the time that a blind man’s feeling
for the hole to have a rod through, a seeing man
will have it through three or four times. The
blind people in the streets mostly know one
another; they say they have all a feeling of
brotherly love for another, owing to their being
similarly afflicted. If I was going along the
street, and had a guide with me that could see,
they would say, ‘Here’s a blind man or blind
woman coming;’ I would say, ‘Put me up to them
so as I’ll speak to them;’ then I should say, as I
laid my hand upon them, ‘Holloa, who’s this?’
they’d say, ‘I’m blind.’ I should answer, ‘So am I.’
‘What’s your name?’ would be the next question.
‘Oh, I have heard tell of you,’ most like, I should
say. ‘Do you know so and so?’ I would say,
‘Yes, he’s coming to see me,’ or perhaps, ‘I’m
going to see him on Sunday:’ then we say, ‘Do
you belong to any of the Institutions?’ that’s the
most particular question of all; and if he’s not a
traveller, and we never heard tell of one another,
the first thing we should ask would be, ‘How did
you lose your sight?’ You see, the way in which
the blind people in the streets gets to know one
another so well, is by meeting at the houses of
gentlemen when we goes for our pensions.”</p>

<p>The boot, shoe, and stay laces, are carried by
the blind, I am told “seldom for sale;” for it’s
very few they sell of them. “They have,” they
say, “to prevent the police or mendicity from
interfering with them, though the police do not
often show a disposition to obstruct them.” “The
officers of the Mendicity Society,” they tell me, “are
their worst enemies.” These, however, have desisted
from molesting them, because the magistrates
object to commit a blind man to prison. The
blind never ask anybody for anything, they tell
me their cry is simply “Bootlace! Bootlace!”
When they do sell, they charge 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per pair for
the leather boot-laces, 1<i>d.</i> per pair the silk boot-laces,
and &frac12;<i>d.</i> per pair for the cotton boot-laces,
and &frac12;<i>d.</i> each for the stay-laces. They generally
carry black laces only, because the white ones are
so difficult to keep clean. For the stay-laces they
pay 2<i>d.</i> a dozen, and for the boot-laces 5<i>d.</i> a
dozen, for the leather or for the silk ones; and
1&frac14;<i>d.</i> for the cotton; each of the boot-laces is
double, so that a dozen makes a dozen pair. They
buy them very frequently at a swag-shop in Compton-street.
My informant carried only the black-cotton
laces, and doesn’t sell six-penny worth in a
week. He did not know of a blind boot lace-seller
that sold more than he did.</p>

<p>“Formerly the blind people in the street used to
make a great deal of money; up to the beginning
of the peace, and during all the war, the blind got
money in handfuls. Where there was one blind
man travelling then, there’s ten now. If they
didn’t take 2<i>l.</i> and 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a day in a large
town, it was reckoned a bad day’s work for the
musicianers. Almost all the blind people then
played music. In war time there was only one
traveller (tramp); there are 100 now. There was
scarcely a common lodging-house then in one
town out of the three; and now there’s not a
village hardly in the country but what there’s one,
and perhaps two or three. Why the lodging-houses
coin money now. Look at a traveller’s house
where there’s twenty beds (two in each bed), at
3<i>d.</i> each, and that’s 10<i>s.</i> you know. There was
very few blind beggars then, and what there was
done well. Certainly, done well; they could get
hatfuls of money almost, but then money was of
no valley scarcely; you could get nothing for it
most; but now if you get a little, you can buy a
plenty with it. What is worth 6<i>d.</i> now fetched
2<i>s.</i> then. I wasn’t in the streets then, I wish
I had been, I should have made a fortin, I think
I should. The blind beggars then could get 2<i>l.</i> a
day if they went to look for it.” “I myself,” said
one, “when I first began, have gone and sat
myself down by the side of the road and got my
1<i>l.</i>, all in half-pence. When I went to Brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>tree,
I stood beside a public-house, the ‘Orange
Tree,’ just by where the foot-people went on to
the fair ground, and I took 15<i>s.</i> a day for two
days only, standing there a pattering my lamentation
from 1 o’clock till the dusk in the evening.
This is what I <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Some say ‘pity the poor blind,’ but the lamentation
is better. It’s a very feeling thing. Many
people stands still and hears it right through, and
gives a halfpenny. I’d give one myself any day
to hear it well said. I’m sure the first time I
heard it the very flesh crept on my bones. I
larnt it to one blind man myself last summer.</p>

<p>“Now just to show you the difference of things
two year afterwards: I went to the very same
place where I had took 1<i>l.</i> by the road side, as I
told, and all I got was 4<i>s.</i>, so you can see how
things was falling. The day I took the 1<i>l.</i>, there
was only one blind man in the town beside me;
but when I got the 4<i>s.</i>, there was three men
blind there. But things now is much worse&mdash;bless
you, a hundred times worse. If I went
now to Braintree fair, I don’t think as I should
take 3<i>s.</i> You see there’s so many blind men now
about that I should’nt wonder if there’d be eight
or ten at that very fair; they don’t know where
to run to now to get a halfpenny; there’s so many
blind people that persons makes game of them.
If they see two near one another, they cries out,
there’s opposition! See what things is come to.
Twelve year ago I should have thought the town
was completely done, and people quite tired of me.
If I didn’t get my shilling going down only one side
of a street, and now I may go up and down and
not get a penny. If I get 3<i>d.</i> I am very well satisfied.
But mind, I may perhaps sometimes meet a
gentlemen who may give me a shilling, or one who
may give me 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a person the other day
tapped me on the shoulder, near Brook-street,
and said, ‘Here’s half-a-crown for you.’ Why,
even five year ago one gentleman gave me 1<i>l.</i>
twice over within three months, and Prince Napoleon
gave me a sovereign last 23rd June was
two year. I know the date, because that’s the
day the blind people goes to the Cloth Hall to get
their quarter’s money, 25<i>s.</i>, and I thought I was
as good as they.” My informant told me he does
better than any of them. “Not one does better
than me,” he said, “because I sticks to it night and
day. It’s 12 o’clock every night before I leave
the streets. You know I leaves home by ten of a
morning. I will have it to get a living. Many
says they don’t know how I stand it to keep so
long on my legs. I only has two meals a day&mdash;my
breakfast, a bit of summat about five or six at
a public-house&mdash;my dog though has plenty. I
feeds him well, poor fellow. Many times I
sleep as I go, and knock my stick just the
same as if I was awake. I get a comfortable
living&mdash;always a little in debt. I’ve got a
very good kerackter, thank God&mdash;indeed all the
blind men has&mdash;they can always get credit; and
my dog gets me many a shilling that I wouldn’t
get at all. But then it’s dreadful slavery. I’ve
never no amusement&mdash;always out excepting on
Sunday. Then I’ve got 5<i>l.</i> from Cloth Hall,
besides a small pension of 1<i>s.</i>, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 5<i>s.</i>
a year from different gentlemen, who allows us poor
blind a small pension yearly. There are many
gentleman do this at the West-end. Some will
allow 10<i>s.</i> a year, and some only 1<i>s.</i> a year, to a
stated number; and they all pay on a particular
day that they may appoint. The Earl of Mansfield
allows twenty-four destitute blind people
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a year; and his mother gives two blind
1<i>l.</i>, and four 10<i>s.</i> The Baroness Rothschild gives
to between seventy and eighty 5<i>s.</i> a piece once a
year.” (“Bless her,” said my informant, most
heartily, “she is a good woman.”) “The Earl
Stanhope gives to between forty and fifty the
same sum every year, and he’s a fine kind-hearted
gentleman. The Earl of Cork’s brother
gives eight or nine of us a shilling a piece once
a year. Lady Otway Cave, she is very good to
us; she gives seventy or eighty of us 1<i>s.</i> each
every fust of May; but the butler, like a many
more, I am told, takes advantage of the blind,
and puts them off with 6<i>d.</i>, and takes a receipt
from them for 1<i>s.</i> The Earl of Normanton gives
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to ten of us. Mrs. Managan, of May-fair,
gives three 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece. The Hon. Miss Brande
1<i>s.</i> a piece to eight. Lady Clements, Grosvenor-square,
2<i>s.</i> a piece to fifteen. The Marchioness
of Aylesbury, 5<i>s.</i> a piece to about thirty. The
Earl of Harrowby gives twelve 5<i>s.</i> a piece. Lord
Dudley Stuart gives to seven or eight 5<i>s.</i> a piece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Mr. Gurney, 1<i>s.</i> a piece to forty. Mr. Ellis, Arlington-street,
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece to fourteen. The Marquis
of Bute used to give 5<i>s.</i> a piece to sixty or
seventy; but the Marchioness, since his death,
has discontinued his allowance. The Dean of
Westminster gives 1<i>s.</i> a piece to thirty on Boxing-day.
Mr. Spottiswoode, 1<i>s.</i> a piece to about fourteen.
Archbishop of Oxford, 5<i>s.</i> a piece to twelve.
Rev. Sir Samuel Jarvis, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece to five.
Lady Dundas, 1<i>s.</i> a piece to about fourteen or
fifteen. The Earl of Besborough, 1<i>s.</i> each to ten.
Lord Stafford, 1<i>s.</i> each to about twenty; he used
to give 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but, owing to his servant, I am
told the sum has been reduced to 1<i>s.</i> Lady
Isabella Thynne, 1<i>s.</i> to ten. The Countess of
Carlisle, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each to sixteen. Earl Fitzwilliam
used to give 5<i>s.</i> to some, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to others, to
about twenty. The Countess of Essex, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
each to three. Lord Hatherton, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each to
twelve. John Ashley Warr, Esq., 5<i>s.</i> each to
twenty-four. Lord Tynemouth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each to
forty. Miss Vaughan, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each to forty (this
is bequeathed for ever). Lord Saltoun, 5<i>s.</i> each
to three. Mr. Hope, 1<i>s.</i> each to fifty. Mr. Warren
(Bryanstone-square), 1<i>s.</i> each to twenty-five. Miss
Howard (York-place), 1<i>s.</i> each to every blind person
that calls on Boxing-day. Sir John Curtis, 1<i>s.</i>
each to eighty (this is also a bequest). Lady
Beresford, 1<i>s.</i> each to forty. Lord Robert Grosvenor
gives 1<i>l.</i> each to some few. The Countess
of Andover, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece to ten. Lord Stanley
used to give 3<i>s.</i> to about twelve; but two years
ago the allowance was discontinued. The Marquis
of Bristol gives 10<i>s.</i> to eighteen. The Bishop of
London, 5<i>s.</i> to every one that can obtain a minister’s
signature. Mr. Mackenzie (Devonshire-place),
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to ten. Mr. Deacon, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to ten. Miss
Sheriff (Manchester-square), 1<i>s.</i> to twenty. Miss
Morrison (Cadogan-place), 1<i>s.</i> each to ten. Mrs.
Kittoye (Wilton-crescent), 1<i>s.</i> to twenty. Mrs.
Ferguson, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each to seven. The Earl of
Haddington, 10<i>s.</i> each to twelve.” I am assured
that these are only half of the donors to the blind,
and that, with the exception of Lady Liddledam,
there is not one person living eastward of Tottenham
Court-road, who allows the smallest pension to the
blind. My informant told me that he knew of no
attorneys, barristers, surgeons, physicians, soldiers
or sailors, who distributed any money to the blind,
nor one tradesman. “I think I get 10<i>s.</i> a week
regular,” he said. “While the quality’s in town
I’m safe. For other times I can’t count above 5<i>s.</i>
a week at the outside&mdash;if it’s the least damp in
the world, the quality will not come out. The
musicians, you see, have got the chance of a damp
day, for then all the best people’s at home;
but such as me does well only when they’re out.
If it wasn’t for the pensions that the quality
gives to the blind during the winter, they
couldn’t do at all. The blind people who have
guides pay them no wages, they find them
their victuals and clothes; but the guides are
mostly children, and the blind are very good to
them; many that I know spoils them.”</p>

<p>The blind people are mostly all of a religious
turn of mind. They all make a point of attending
divine service; and the majority of them are
Catholics. My informant knew only five among
his blind neighbours who were Protestants&mdash;and
two of these were Presbyterians, one a Methodist,
and two Churchmen; and on the other hand
he numbered up fourteen Catholics, all going to the
same chapel, and living within a short distance of
himself. They are peculiarly distinguished by a
love of music. “It’s a sure bit of bread to the
most; besides, it makes them independent, you
see, and that’s a great thing to people like us.”
There is not one teetotaller, I am told, among the
street blind, but they are not distinguished by a
love of drink. The blind musicians often, when
playing at public-houses, are treated to drink, and,
indeed, when performing in the streets, are taken
by drunken men to play at taverns, and there
supplied with liquor; but they do not any of
them make a habit of drinking. There is, however,
one now in prison who is repeatedly intoxicated;
and this, the blind say, is a great injury
to them; for people who see one of them drunk in
the streets, believe that they are all alike; and
there is one peculiarity among them all&mdash;being
continually mistaken for one another. However
different they may be in features, still, from the
circumstance of their being blind, and being
mostly accompanied by a dog, or a guide, few
persons can distinguish one from another. They
are mostly very jealous, they tell me, because they
say every one takes advantage of their affliction,
even their own children, and their own wives.
“Some of the wives dress themselves very gaily,
because they know their husbands can’t see their
fine clothes, particularly those that have got no
children&mdash;then there’s none to tell. But, pray mind
I only speaking of some of them&mdash;don’t blame the
whole. People never took no money out of my
dog’s basket&mdash;two gals of the town once did try to
steal a shilling out of it, that some gentleman had
dropped in, but the dog barked, and they gave a
scream, and run away. Many of the blind men
have married blind women&mdash;they say that they
don’t like seeing women. If seeing men find it a
hard job to take care of seeing women, how are
blind men to do it?” My informant knows six
blind men who have married blind wives&mdash;the
blind wives, I am told, stick closer to home&mdash;and
do not want to go to plays, or dances, or shows,
and have no love of dress&mdash;and they are generally
more sober than those who can see. “A blind
person,” says one, “has no reason to be as wicked
as those that can see&mdash;there’s not half the temptation,
you know. The women do all their household
duties as well as if they had their eyesight.
They make puddings and pies, and boil them, or
send them to the oven, as well, as quick, and as
handy as a woman that can see. They sweep the
floor without leaving a speck; and tidy the room,
and black-lead the grate, and whiten the hearth,
and dress the chimney-piece off quite handsome, I
can tell you. They take great pride in their
chimney-piece&mdash;they like other people to see it&mdash;and
they take great pride in having their house
quite clean and neat. Where I live it’s the
remark of all, that they who can’t see have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
houses the cleanest. I don’t know of any blind
person that has a looking-glass over the mantelpiece,
though. I’m sure that many would, if
they had the money, just to please their friends.
And, what’s more strange, the blind wives will
wash their husbands’ shirts quite clean.” “The
blind are very fond of their children, you see, sir,”
said one; “we owe so much to them, they’re such
helps to us, even from their very infancy. You’ll
see a little thing that can hardly walk, leading
her blind father about, and then, may be, our
affliction makes them loves us the more. The
blind people are more comfortable at home&mdash;they
are more together, and more dependent on one
another, and don’t like going out into company as
others do. With women a love of company is
mostly of a love of seeing others, and being seen
themselves, so the blind wives is happy and contented
at home. No man that could see, unless
he was a profligate, would think of marrying a
blind woman; and the blind women knows this,
and that’s why they love their blind husbands the
more&mdash;they pity one another, and so can’t help
liking each other.” Now, it’s strange, that with
so many blind couples living together, no one ever
heard of any accident from fire with blind people&mdash;the
fact is, their blindness makes them so careful,
that there’s no chance of it: besides, when
there’s two blind people together, they never
hardly light a candle at all, except when a stranger
comes in, and then they always ask him, before
he leaves, to put the light out.</p>

<p>The blind people generally are persons of great
feeling; they are very kind and charitable to persons
who are in any way afflicted, or even to poor
persons. Many of those who live on charity
themselves are, I am assured, very generous to
those that want. One told me that “a beggar
had come to his house, and he had made him
cry with his story; my heart” he said, “was
that full I was ashamed.” They’re not particularly
proud, though they like to be well-dressed,
and they say that no one can get a wife
so soon as a blind man. One assured me that
he’d go into any lodging-house in the country
and get two or three if he wanted&mdash;only they’d
fight, he said. “You see in the lodging-houses
there are many woman whose husbands (but they’re
not married, you know) have told them to go on
and said they would follow them, which of course
they don’t; or there’s many in such places as
wants a companion. When a blind man goes into
one of these houses, a woman is sure to say to him,
‘Can I fetch you anything, master?’ Half an
ounce of tea may be, and when they’ve got it, of
course, they’re invited to have a cup, and that
does the business. She becomes the blind man’s
guide after that. The next morning, after telling
one another where to meet&mdash;‘I’m going such a
road,’ they whisper to each other,&mdash;away they
starts. I’ve known many a blind man run away
with a seeing man’s wife. The women, I think,
does it for a living, and that’s all.</p>

<p>“I can’t see the least light in the world&mdash;not
the brightest sun that ever shone. I
have pressed my eye-balls&mdash;they are quite decayed,
you see; but I have pushed them in,
and they have merely hurt me, and the water
has run from them faster than ever. I have never
seen any colours when I did so.” (This question
was asked to discover whether the illusion called
“peacock’s feathers” could still be produced by
pressure on the nerve). “I have been struck on
the eye since I have been blind, and then I
have seen a flash of fire like lightning. I know
it’s been like that, because I’ve seen the
lightning sometimes, when it’s been very vivid,
even since I was stone blind. It was terrible
pain when I was struck on the eye. A man one
day was carrying some chairs along the street, and
struck me right in the eye-ball with the end of
the leg of one of the chairs; and I fell to the
ground with the pain. I thought my heart was
coming out of my mouth; then I saw the brightest
flash that ever I saw, either before or since I was
blind.” (I irritated the ball of the eye with the
object of discovering whether the nerve was decayed,
but found it impossible to produce any luminous
impression&mdash;though I suspect this arose principally
from the difficulty of getting him to direct
his eye in the proper direction). “I know the difference
of colours, because I remember them; but I
can’t distinguish them by my touch, nor do I
think that any blind man in the world ever could.
I have heard of blind people playing at cards, but
it’s impossible they can do so any other way than
by having them marked. I know many that
plays cards that way.” He was given two similar
substances, but of different colours, to feel, but
could not distinguish between them&mdash;both were
the same to him, he said, “with the exception that
one felt stiffer than the other. I know hundreds
of people myself&mdash;and they know hundreds more&mdash;and
none of us has ever heard of one that could
tell colours by the feel. There’s blind people in
the school can tell the colours of their rods; but
they do so by putting their tongue to them, and
so they can distinguish them that’s been dipped in
copperas from them that hasn’t. I know blind people
can take a clock to pieces, and put it together again,
as well as any person that can see. Blind
people gets angry when they hear people talk of
persons seeing with their fingers. A man has
told me that a blind person in St. James’s workhouse
could read the newspaper with his fingers,
but that, the blind know, is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>Many blind men can, I am told, distinguish
between the several kinds of wood by touch alone.
Mahogany, oak, ash, elm, deal, they say, have all
a different feel. They declare it is quite ridiculous,
the common report, that blind people can discern
colours by the touch. One of my informants, who
assured me that he was considered to be one of
the cleverest of blind people, told me that he had
made several experiments on this subject, and
never could distinguish the least difference between
black or red, or white, or yellow, or blue, or, indeed,
any of the mixed colours. “My wife,” said
one, “went blind so young, that she doesn’t never
remember having seen the light; and I am often
sorry for her that she has no idea of what a beautiful
thing light or colours is. We often talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
it together, and then she goes a little bit melancholy,
because I can’t make her understand what
the daylight is like, or the great delight that there
is in seeing it. I’ve often asked whether she
knows that the daylight and the candlelight is of
different colours, and she has told me she thinks
they are the same; but then she has no notion of
colours at all. Now, it’s such people as these I
pities.” I told the blind man of Sanderson’s wonderful
effect of imagination in conceiving that the
art of seeing was similar to that of a series of
threads being drawn from the distant object to
the eye; and he was delighted with the explanation,
saying, “he could hardly tell how a born blind
man could come at such an idea.” On talking with
this man, he told me he remembered having seen
a looking-glass once&mdash;his mother was standing
putting her cap on before it, and he thought he
never saw anything so pretty as the reflection of
the half-mourning gown she had on, and the white
feathery pattern upon it (he was five years old then).
He also remembered having seen his shadow, and
following it across the street; these were the only
two objects he can call to mind. He told me that
he knew many blind men who could not comprehend
how things could be seen, round or square,
<i>all at once</i>; they are obliged, they say, to pass
their fingers all over them; and how it is that the
shape of a thing can be known in an instant, they
cannot possibly imagine. I found out that this
blind man fancied the looking-glass reflected only
one object at once&mdash;only the object that was immediately
in front of it; and when I told him that,
looking in the glass, I could see everything in the
room, and even himself, with my back turned towards
him, he smiled with agreeable astonishment.
He said, “You see how little I have thought about
the matter.” There was a blind woman of his
acquaintance, he informed me, who could thread
the smallest needle with the finest hair in a minute,
and never miss once. “She’ll do it in a second.
Many blind women thread their needles with their
tongues; the woman who stitches by the Polytechnic
always does so.” My informant was very
fond of music. One of the blind makes his own
teeth, he told me; his front ones have all been
replaced by one long bit of bone which he has
fastened to the stumps of his two eye teeth: he
makes them out of any old bit of bone he can
pick up. He files them and drills a hole through
them to fasten them into his head, and eats his food
with them. He is obliged to have teeth because he
plays the clarionet in the street. “Music,” he said,
“is our only enjoyment, we all like to listen to it
and learn it.” It affects them greatly, they tell me,
and if a lively tune is played, they can hardly help
dancing. “Many a tune I’ve danced to so that I
could hardly walk the next day,” said one. Almost
all of the blind men are clever at reckoning. It
seems to come natural to them after the loss of their
sight. By counting they say they spend many a dull
hour&mdash;it appears to be all mental arithmetic with
them, for they never aid their calculations by their
fingers or any signs whatever. My informant
knew a blind man who could reckon on what day
it was new moon for a hundred years back, or when
it will be new moon a century to come&mdash;he had
never had a book read to him on the subject in his
life&mdash;he was one of the blind wandering musicians.
My informant told me he often sits for hours and
calculates how many quarters of ounces there are
in a ship-load of tea, and such like things. Many
of the blind are very partial to the smell of
flowers. My informant knew one blind man
about the streets who always would have some
kind of smelling flowers in his room.</p>

<p>“The blind are very ingenious; oh, very!” said
one to me, “they can do anything that they can
feel. One blind man who kept a lodging-house at
Manchester and had a wife fond of drink, made a
little chest of drawers (about two feet high), in
which he used to put his money, and so cleverly
did he arrange it that neither his wife nor any one
else could get at the money without breaking the
drawers all to pieces. Once while her blind husband
was on his travels, she opened every drawer
by means of false keys, and though she took each
one out, she could find no means to get at the
money, which she could hear jingling inside when
she shook it. At last she got so excited over it that
she sent for a carpenter, and even he was obliged to
confess that he could not get to it without taking
the drawers to pieces. The same blind man had a
great fancy for white mice, and made a little house
for them out of pieces of wood cut into the shape
of bricks: there were doors, windows, and all,” said
my informant. The blind are remarkable for the
quickness of their hearing&mdash;one man assured me
he could hear the lamp-posts in the streets, and,
indeed, any <i>substance</i> (any solid thing he said)
that he passed in the street, provided it be as high
as his ear; if it were below that he could not <i>hear</i>
it so well.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I can hear any substance in
the street as I pass it by, even the lamp-post or a
dead wall&mdash;anything that’s the height of my
head, let it be ever so small, just as well, and tell
what it is as well as you as can see. One night
I was coming home&mdash;you’ll be surprised to hear
this&mdash;along Burlington-gardens, between twelve
and one o’clock, and a gentleman was following
me. I knew he was not a poor man by his walk,
but I didn’t consider he was watching me. I just
heerd when I got between Sackville-street and
Burlington-street. Oh, I knows every inch of
the street, and I can go as quick as you can, and
walk four mile an hour; know where I am all the
while. I can tell the difference of the streets by
the sound of my ear&mdash;a wide street and a narrow
street&mdash;I can’t tell a long street till I get to the
bottom of it. I can tell when I come to an opening
or a turning just by the click on the ear, without
either my touching with hand or stick. Well,
as I was saying, this gentleman was noticing me,
and just as I come to turn up Cork-street, which,
you know, is my road to go into Bond-street, on
my way home; just as I come into Cork-street,
and was going to turn round the corner, the
sergeant of police was coming from Bond-street,
at the opposite corner of Cork-street, I heerd him,
and he just stopped to notice me, but didn’t know
the gentleman was noticing me too. I whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
round the corner as quick as any man that had
his sight, and said, ‘Good night, policeman.’ I
can tell a policeman’s foot anywhere, when he
comes straight along in his regular way while on
his beat, and they all know it too. I can’t tell
it where there’s a noise, but in the stillness of the
night nothing would beat me. I can’t hear the
lamp-posts when there’s a noise. When I said,
‘Good night, policeman,’ the gentleman whipped
across to him, and says, ‘Is that man really blind?’
and by this time I was half way up Cork-street,
when the gentleman hallooed to me to stop; and
he comes up, and says, says he, ‘Are you really
blind?’ The sergeant of police was with him, and
he says, ‘Yes, he is really blind, sir;’ and then he
says, ‘How is it that you go so cleverly along the
street if you’re blind?’ Well, I didn’t want to
stop bothering with him, so I merely says, ‘I
do far cleverer things than that. I can hear the
lamp-post as well as you that can see it.’ He
says, ‘Yes, because you know the distance from one
to another.’ The sergeant stood there all the time,
and he says, ‘No, that can’t be, for they’re not a
regular distance one from another.’ Then the
gentleman says, ‘Now, could you tell if I was
standing in the street when you passed me by?’
I said, ‘Yes; but you mustn’t stand behind the
lamp-post to deceive me with the sound of the
substance.’ Then he went away to try me, and a
fine try we had. He will laugh when he sees
that they’re all put down. When he went away I
recollected that if he didn’t stand as near to the
pavement as the lamp-post is, and remain still,
he’d deceive me. Oh, certainly, I couldn’t hear
him if he was far off, and I shouldn’t hear him in
the same way as I can hear the lamp-posts if he
didn’t stand still. The policeman hallooed after
him, and told him that he mustn’t deceive me;
but he wouldn’t make no answer, for fear I should
catch the sound of his voice and know where he
was. I had agreed to touch every substance as I
went along and round the street to look for him;
we always call it looking though we are blind.
Well, when he had stood still the sergeant told me
to go; he’s the sergeant of St. James’ station-house,
and has been often speaking to me since
about it; and on I went at the rate of about three
mile an hour, and touched every lamp-post without
feeling for them, but just struck them with my
stick as I went by, without stopping, and cried
out, ‘There’s a substance.’ At last I come to him.
There’s a mews, you know, just by the hotel in
Cork-street, and the gentleman stood between the
mews and Clifford-street, in Cork-street; and when
I come up to him, I stopped quite suddenly, and
cried out ‘There’s a substance.’ As I was offering
to touch him with my stick, he drew back very
softly, just to deceive me. Then he would have
another try, but I picked him out again, but that
wouldn’t satisfy him, and he would try me a third
time; and then, when I come up to him, he kept
drawing back, right into the middle of the road.
I could hear the stones scrunch under his feet; so
I says, ‘Oh, that’s not fair;’ and he says, ‘Well,
I’m bet.’ Then he made me a present, and said
that he would like to spend an hour some night
with me again. I don’t think he was a doctor,
’cause he never took no notice of my eyes,
but he was a real gentleman&mdash;the sergeant
said so.</p>

<p>“When I dream, it’s just the same as I am
now, I dream of hearing and touching. The last
dream that I had was about a blind man&mdash;that’s
in prison just now. I went into his wife’s house,
I knew it was her house by the sound of my foot
in it. I can tell whether a place is clean or dirty
by the sound. Then I heard her say, ‘Well, how
do you get on?’ and I said ‘Very well;’ and she
said ‘Sit down,’ and after sitting there a little
while, I heard a voice at the door, and I said to
her, ‘Bless me, wouldn’t you think that was John;’
she said, ‘Yes, I would,’ but she took no farther
notice, and I heard his voice repeatedly. I
thought he was speaking to a child, and I got up
and went to the door, and says, ‘Halloa! is this
you;’ I was quite surprised and took him by the
arm (laying his hand on his own) and he was in
his shirt sleeves. I knew that by the feel. Then
I was kind of afeard of him, though I am not
afeard of anything. I was rather surprised that
he should come out three weeks before his time.
Then I dreamt that he tried to frighten and
pushed me down on the floor, that way (making
the motion sideways), to make me believe he was
a ghost. I felt it as plain as I should if you
were to do the same to me now. I says to him
‘Don’t be so foolish, sit down’, and I pushed him
away and got up. When I got up, his wife says
to him, ‘Sit down, John, and don’t be so foolish;
sit down, and behave yourself;’ and then we set
down the two of us, just on the edge of the bed
(here he moved his hand along the edge of the
table). I thought it was turned down. He’s a
very resolute man and a wicked one, this blind
man is, so I would like to have been out from
him, but I was afeard to go, for he’d got a hold of
me; after that I waked and I heerd no more.
But it’s my real opinion that he’s dead now, it is
indeed, through having such dreams of him I
think so; and the same night his wife dreamt
that I was killed and all knocked into about a
hundred pieces; and those two dreams convince
me something’s come to him. Oh, I do firmly believe
in dreams, that I do; they’re sent for people
to foresee things, I’m certain of it, if people will
only take notice of ’em. I have been many times
in prison myself, while I’ve been travelling the
country. You know in many towns they comes
and takes you up without given you never no
warning if they catches you begging. I was took
up once in Liverpool, once in Hull, once in Exeter,
and once in Biddeford, in Devonshire. Most of
the times I had a month, and one of them only
seven days. I think that’s very unjust&mdash;never
to say you mustn’t do it; but to drag you off
without never no warning. Every time before I
was put in quod I had always dreamt that my
father was starving to death for want of victuals,
and at last I got to know whenever I dreamt
that, I was sure of going to prison. I never
dreamt about my mother; she died, you see, when
I was very young, and I never remember hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
her speak but once or twice. My father never
did the thing that was right to me, and I didn’t
care much about him. When I was at home I
was very fond of pigeons, and my mind went
so much upon them, that I used to dream of it
the night before, always when they had eggs,
and when my rabbits had young ones too. I
know when I wake in the morning that I am
awake by my thoughts. Sometimes I dream
I’ve got a lot of money in my hand, and when
I wake and put my hand to feel it, it’s gone,
there’s none there, and so I know it’s been only a
dream. I’m much surprised at my disappointment
though.”</p>

<p>Many of the blind are very fond of keeping
birds and animals; some of them keep pigeons in
one of their rooms, others have cocks and hens,
and others white mice and rabbits, and almost all
have dogs, though all are not led about by them.
Some blind men take delight in having nothing
but bull-dogs, not to lead them, but solely for
fancy. Nobody likes a dog so much as a blind
man, I am told&mdash;“they can’t&mdash;the blind man is
so much beholden to his dog, he does him such
favours and sarvices.” “With my dog I can go to
any part of London as independent as any one
who has got his sight. Yesterday afternoon when
I left your house, sir, I was ashamed of going
through the street. People was a saying, ‘Look’ee
there, that’s the man as says he’s blind.’ I
was going so quick, it was so late you know,
they couldn’t make it out, but without my dog
I must have crawled along, and always be in
great fear. The name of my present dog is
‘<span class="smcap">Keeper</span>;’ he is a mongrel breed; I have had
him nine years, and he is with me night and
day, goes to church with me and all. If I
go out without him, he misses me, and then he
scampers all through the streets where I am in the
habit of going, crying and howling after me, just as
if he was fairly out of his mind. It’s astonishing.
Often, before my first blind wife died (for I’ve
been married twice to blind women, and once to a
seeing woman), I used to say I’d sooner lose my
wife than my dog; but when I did lose her I was
sorry that ever I did say so. I didn’t know what
it was. I’m sorry for it yet, and ever will be
sorry for it; she was a very good woman, and had
fine principles. I shall never get another that I
liked so much as the first. My dog knows every
word I say to him. Tell him to turn right or left,
or cross over, and whip! round he goes in a moment.
Where I go for my tobacco, at the shop in
Piccadilly, close to the Arcade&mdash;it’s down six or
seven steps, straight down&mdash;and when I tells
Keeper to go to the baccy shop, off he is, and drags
me down the steps, with the people after me, thinking
he’s going to break my neck down the place,
and the people stands on top the steps making all
kinds of remarks, while I’m below. If he was to
lose me to-night or to-morrow, he’d come back here
and rise the whole neighbourhood. He knows
any public-house, no matter whether he was there
before or not; just whisper to him, go to the
public-house, and away he scampers and drags me
right into the first he comes to. Directly I whisper
to him, go to the public-house, he begins playing
away with the basket he has in his mouth,
throwing it up and laying it down&mdash;throwing it
and laying it down for pleasure; he gets his rest
there, and that’s why he’s so pleased. It’s the
only place I can go to in my rounds to sit down.
Oh, he’s a dear clever fellow. Now, only to show
you how faithful he is, one night last week I was
coming along Burlington-gardens, and I stopped to
light my pipe as I was coming home, and I let
him loose to play a bit and get a drink; and after
I had lit my pipe I walked on, for I knew the
street very well without any guide. I didn’t take
notice of the dog, for I thought he was following
me. I was just turning into Clifford-street when
I heard the cries of him in Burlington-gardens.
I know his cry, let him be ever so far away; the
screech that he set up was really quite dreadful;
it would grieve anybody to hear him. So I puts
my fingers in my mouth and gives a loud whistle;
and at last he heard me, and then up he comes
tearing along and panting away as if his heart was
in his mouth; and when he gets up to me he
jumped up to me right upon my back, and screams
like&mdash;as if really he wanted to speak&mdash;you can’t
call it panting, because it’s louder than that, and
he does pant when he a’n’t tired at all; all I can
say is, it’s for all the world like his speaking, and
I understands it as such. If I say a cross word
to him after he’s lost&mdash;such as, ah, you rascal, you&mdash;he’ll
just stand of one side, and give a cry just
like a Christian. I’ve known him break the
windows up two story high when I’ve left him
behind, and down he would have been after me
only he durstn’t jump out. I’ve had Keeper nine
year. The dog I had before him was Blucher;
he was a mongrel too; he had a tail like a wolf,
an ear like a fox, and a face black like a monkey.
I had him thirteen year. He was as clever as
Keeper, but not so much loved as he is. At last
he went blind; he was about two year losing his
sight. When I found his eyes was getting bad I
got Keeper. The way I first noticed him going
blind was when I would come to cross a street on
my way home; at nightfall the shade of the house
on the opposite side, as we was crossing, would
frighten him and drive him in the middle of the
road; and he wouldn’t draw to the pavement till
he found he was wrong; and then after that he
began to run again the lamp-posts in the dark;
when he did this he’d cry out just like a Christian.
I was sorry for him, and he knowed that,
for I used to fret. I was sorry for him on account
of my own affliction. At last I was obligated
to take to Keeper. I got him of another
blind man, but he had no larning in him when he
come to me. I was a long time teaching him, for I
didn’t do it all at once. I could have teached him
in a week, but I used to let the old dog have a
run, while I put Keeper into the collar for a bit”
(here the blind man was some time before he could
proceed for his tears), “and so he larnt all he knows,
little by little. Now Keeper and Blucher used to
agree pretty well; but I’ve got another dog now,
named Dash, and Keeper’s as jealous of him as a
woman is of a man. If I say, ‘Come Keeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
come and have the collar on,’ I may call twenty
times before he’ll come; but if I say, ‘Dash,
come and have the collar on,’ Keeper’s there the first
word, jumping up agin me, and doing anything
but speak. At last my old Blucher went stone
blind, as bad as his master; it was, poor thing;
and then he used to fret so when I went out
without him that I couldn’t bear it, and so
got at length to take him always with me,
and then he used to follow the knock of my
stick. He done so for about six months, and
then I was one night going along Piccadilly and
I stops speaking to a policeman, and Blucher
misses me; he couldn’t hear where I was for the
noise of the carriages. He didn’t catch the sound
of my stick, and couldn’t hear my voice for the
carriages, so he went seeking me into the middle
of the road, and there a buss run over him, poor
thing. I heerd him scream out and I whistled
to him, and he came howling dreadful on to the
pavement again. I didn’t think he was so much
hurt then, for I puts the collar on him to take
him safe back, and he led me home blind as he
was. The next morning he couldn’t rise up at
all, his hind parts was useless to him. I took
him in my arms and found he couldn’t move.
Well, he never eat nor drink nothing for a week,
and got to be in such dreadful pain that I was
forced to have him killed. I got a man to drown
him in a bag. I could’nt have done it myself
for all the world. It would have been as bad to
me as killing a Christian. I used to grieve terribly
after I’d lost him. I couldn’t get him off
my mind. I had had him so many years, and he
had been with me night and day, my constant
companion, and the most faithful friend I ever
had, except Keeper: there’s nothing in the world
can beat Keeper for faithfulness&mdash;nothing.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of a Blind boot-lace Seller.</span></h3>

<p>The blind boot lace-seller who gave me the following
history of his life was the original of the
portrait given in No. 17. He was a tall, strongly-built
man. In face he was ghastly, his cheek
bones were sharp and high, his nose flat to his
face, and his eyes were so deeply sunk in that he
had more the appearance of a death’s head than
of a living man. His shirt was scrupulously
clean. He wore a bright red cotton neckerchief
and a plaid waistcoat of many colours. His
dog accompanied him and never left his master’s
side one moment.</p>

<p>“It’s very sorrowful&mdash;very sorrowful indeed
to hear that,” said the boot-lace seller to me, on
my reading him the account of the blind needle-seller;
“it touches me much to hear that. But
you see I don’t grieve for the loss of my sight as
he do, poor man. I don’t remember ever seeing
any object. If there was a thing with many
colours in it, I could dissarn the highest colour.
I couldn’t tell one from another, but only the
highest.</p>

<p>“I was born in Northumberland,” he said,
“about five-and-fifty years ago. My father was
a grocer and had 1,000<i>l.</i> worth of freehold property
besides his business, which was very large for a
small town; his was the principal shop, and in
the general line. He had a cart of his own, in
which he attended market. I was very comfortably
brought up, never wanted for nothing, and had
my mother lived I should have had an independent
fortune. At five years old, while mother
was still alive, I caught the small pox. I had
four sisters and one brother, and we all six had it
at once; that was before the vaccination was
properly established. I’ve heerd said that father
did not want to have us inoculated, because of
the people coming backwards and forwards to the
shop. I only wish vaccination had been in vogue
then as it is now, and I shouldn’t have lost my
eyes. God bless the man who brought it up, I
say; people doesn’t know what they’ve got to
thank him for. Well, all my sisters and brothers
had not a mark upon them. It laid hold of only
me. They couldn’t lay a finger upon me, they
was obligated to lift me up in one of my father’s
shirts, by holding the corners of it like a sheet. As
soon as ever the pock began to decay it took
away my eyes altogether. I didn’t lose both my
eyeballs till about twenty years after that, though
my sight was gone for all but the shadow of daylight
and any high colours. At sixteen years of
age my left eye bursted; I suffered terribly then&mdash;oh
terribly! yes, that I did. The black-and-white
like all mixed together, the pock came right
through the star of the eye the doctor said; and
when I was five-and-twenty my other eye-ball
bursted, and then my eyes was quite out of my
head. Till that time I could see a little bit; I
could tell the daylight, and I could see the moon,
but not the shape of it. I never could see a star,
and do you know I grieved about the loss of that
little bit of sight as much as if I was losing the
whole of it. As my eye-ball sloughed day by
day, I could see the light going away by little,
every day till the week’s end. When I looked at
the daylight just before it all went, I could see
the light look as red as fire&mdash;as red as blood;
and when it all left me, oh, I was dreadful sorrowful,
I thought I was lost altogether. But, I
shouldn’t have been so bad off, as I said, if
mother had lived, but she died when I was about
six year old. I didn’t care much about her, indeed I
took a dreadful dislike to her. I heerd her say
one day to a person in the shop, that she
would sooner see me dead and buried than
be as I was, but now I know that it was her
fondness for me. Mother catched a cold, and
died after six day’s illness. When she was gone,
father got to neglect his business. He had no one
then to attend to it, and he took and shut up the
shop. He lost heart, you see. He took and
turned all the tenants out of his property, and
furnished all the rooms of a large house suitable
for the quality that used to come to the town to
bathe. He mortgaged the place for 250<i>l.</i> to buy
the furniture, and that was the ruin of him.
Eighteen years afterwards the lawyers got the
better of him, and all the family was turned out
of the door without a penny. My father they’d
put in jail before. He died a few years afterwards
in the workhouse. When the family was turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
out, there was only my eldest brother away at
sea, and my eldest sister in sarvice; so me and my
three sisters was sent in the wide world without
the means of getting a crust or a place to put our
heads in. All my sisters after that got into
sarvice, and I went to drive some coal carts at
North Shields. The coal carts was father’s, and
they was all he had left out of his property; so I
used to go to Wall’s End and fill the carts, then
take them down to North Shields and sell them
at the people’s doors. We never used to sell less
than the load. I did all this, blind as I was,
without a person to guide, and continued at it
night and day for about fifteen year. It was
well known to the whole country side. I was
the talk for miles round. They couldn’t believe
I was blind; though they see my eyes was gone,
still they couldn’t hardly believe. Then, after the
fifteen year, me and my father had a complete
fall out. He took an advantage of my sister. He
had borrowed 20<i>l.</i> of her, and when he could he
wouldn’t pay her. He behaved as bad as father
could, and then I broke with him.” (He then
went over the whole story, and was affected,
even to speechlessness, at the remembrance of his
family troubles. Into these there is no necessity
to enter here; suffice it, the blind man appears
to have behaved very nobly.) “I came away
and went to my brother, who was well off at
Hull; when I got there, I found he had gone to
Russia and died there that very spring. While I
was on my way to Hull, I used to go to sleep at the
lodging-houses for travellers. I had never been in
one before, and there I got to think, from what I
heerd, that a roving life was a fine pleasant one.
The very first lodging-house I went into was one
in Durham, and there persons as was coming the
same road persuaded me to go and beg with them,
but I couldn’t cheek it; it was too near hand at
home. We came on to Darlington, that was 18
miles further, that day. They still kept company
with me, and wanted me to beg, but I wouldn’t;
I couldn’t face it. I thought people would know
me. The next day we started on our way to
Northallerton, and then my few shillings was all
gone; so that night we went to seek relief, and
got a pennyworth of milk, and a penny loaf each
and our bed. The parish gave us a ticket to a
lodging-house. The next morning we started from
Northallerton, and then I was very hungry; all I
had the day before was the pennyworth of bread
I got from the parish. Then as we got about a
mile out of the town, there was a row of houses,
and the Scotchman who was with me says, ‘If
ye’ll gang up wi’ me, I’ll speak for ye.’ Well,
we went up and got 3<i>d.</i>, and plenty of bread and
butter; almost every house we got something at;
then I was highly delighted; thinks I, this is a
business&mdash;and so I did. We shared with the
other man who had come on the road with us, and
after that we started once more, and then I was
all eager to go on with the same business.
You see I’d never had no pleasure, and it
seemed to me like a new world&mdash;to be
able to get victuals without doing anything&mdash;instead
of slaving as I’d been with a couple
of carts and horses at the coal-pits all the time.
I didn’t think the country was half so big, and
you couldn’t credit the pleasure I felt in going
about it. I felt as if I didn’t care for nothing; it
was so beautiful to be away there quite free, without
any care in the world, for I could see plainly
I could always get the best of victuals, and the
price of my lodgings. There’s no part in all
England like Yorkshire for living. We used to
go to all the farm-houses, we wouldn’t miss one
if it was half a mile off the road; if the Scotchman
who was with me could only see a road he’d
take me up it, and we got nice bits of pie and
meat, and bread and cake, indeed as much as
would serve four people, when we got to the
lodging-house at night and a few shillings beside.
I soon got not to care about the loss of my brother.
At last we got to make so much money that I
thought it was made to chuck about the streets.
We got it so easy, you see. It was only 4<i>s.</i> or
5<i>s.</i>, but then I was only a flatty or I could have
made 14<i>s.</i> or 15<i>s.</i> at least. This was in Borough-bridge,
and there at a place called, I think,
Bridely-hill, there was a lodging-house without
never a bed in it at all; but only straw littered
on the ground, and here I found upwards of sixty
or seventy, all tramps, and living in different ways,
pattering, and thieving, and singing, and all sorts;
and that night I got to think it was the finest
scene I had ever known. I grew pleaseder, and
pleaseder, with the life, and wondered how any
one could follow any other. There was no drunkenness,
but it was so new and strange, and I’d never
known nothing of life before, that I was bewildered,
like, with over-joy at it. Then I soon got to
think I’d have the summer’s pleasure out and
wouldn’t go near Hull till the back end of the year,
for it was the month of May, that what I’m
talking about took place; and so things went on.
I never thought of home, or sisters, or anything,
indeed. I was so over-joyed that I could think
of nothing else. Whenever I got to a new county
it seemed like getting into a new nation, and
when I heard we were close upon a new place I
used to long and long to get into it. At last I
left the Scotchman and took up with an old sailor,
a man-of-warsman, who was coming up to London
to get his pension, and he was a regular ‘cadger’
like the other who had put me ‘fly to the dodge,’
though none of us wer’nt ‘fly’ to nothing then.
I can’t tell you, I wanted to, how I longed to be in
town, and, as I came through the streets with him, I
didn’t know whether I carried the streets or they
carried me. You see I had heard people talk about
London in North Shields, and I thought there was
no poor people there at all&mdash;none but ladies and
gentlemen and sailors. In London the sailor drew
his pension, and he and me got robbed, and then
the sailor left me, and then I started off without
a penny into the country; and at Stratford-le-Bow
I began, for the first time, to say, ‘Pity the poor
blind.’ Up to this time I had never axed no one&mdash;never
spoke, indeed&mdash;the cadgers who had been
with me had done this for me, and glad to have
the chance of sharing with me. A blind man
can get a guide at any place, because they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
he’s sure to get something. I took only 5<i>d.</i> at
Stratford-le-Bow, and then started on my way to
Romford; and there, in the lodging-house, I met a
blind man, who took me in partnership with him,
and larnt me my business complete&mdash;that he just
did, and since then I’ve been following it, and
that’s about two or three and twenty year ago.
Since I’ve been in London, and that’s fourteen
year, I’ve lived very regular, always had a place,
and attended my church. If it hadn’t been for
the lodging-houses I should never, may be, have
been as I am; though, I must confess, I always
had a desire to find out travelling, but couldn’t
get hold of any one to put me in the way of it.
I longed for a roving life and to shake a loose leg,
still I couldn’t have done much else after my
quarrel with my father. My sister had offered to
lend me money enough to buy a horse and cart
for myself, but I didn’t like that, and thought I’d
get it of my brother at Hull; and that and the
padding kens is solely the cause of my being as I
am; and since I first travelled there’s more now
than ever&mdash;double and treble as many.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Low Lodging-Houses.</span></h3>

<p>The revelations of the Blind Boot-Lace Seller concerning
the low lodging-houses make me anxious
to arouse the public to a full sense of the atrocities
committed and countenanced in those infamous
places. It will have been noticed that the blind
man frankly tells us that he was “taught his
business” as a mendicant in one of these houses
of call for vagabonds of all kinds&mdash;beggars, prostitutes,
cheats, and thieves. Up to the time of his
starting to see his brother at Hull, he appears to
have had no notion of living but by his labour,
and, more especially, no wish to make a trade of
his affliction. Till then he seems to have been
susceptible of some of the nobler impulses of humanity,
and to have left his home solely because
he refused to be party to a fraud on his own sister.
Unfortunately, however, on his way to carry
out his generous purposes, he put up for the night
at the “travellers’” house in the town where he
arrived, at the end of his first day’s journey; from
the very minute that he set foot in the place he
was a lost man. Here were assembled scores of
the most degraded and vicious members of society,
lying in ambush, as it were, like tigers in
the jungle, ready to spring upon and make a prey
of any one who came within the precincts of their
lair. To such as these&mdash;sworn to live on the labours
of others, and knowing almost to a sixpence
the value of each human affliction as a means of
operating upon both the heart-strings and the
purse-strings of the more benevolent of the industrious
or the affluent&mdash;to such as these, I say,
a blind man, unskilled in the art and system
of mendicancy, was literally a God-send. A
shipwreck or a colliery explosion, as they too
well knew, some of the more sceptical of the
public <i>might</i> call in question, but a real blind man,
with his eye-balls gone, was beyond all doubt;
and to inspire faith, as they were perfectly aware,
was one of the most important and difficult
processes of the beggar’s craft. Besides, of
all misfortunes, blindness is one which, to those
who have their sight, appears not only the greatest
of human privations, but a privation which wholly
precludes the possibility of self-help, and so gives
the sufferer the strongest claim on our charity.
In such a place, therefore, as a low lodging-house,
the common resort of all who are resolved not to
work for their living, it was almost impossible
for a blind man to pass even an hour without
every virtuous principle of his nature being undermined,
and overtures of the most tempting
character being made to him. To be allowed to
go partners in so valuable a misfortune was a
privilege that many there would strive for; accordingly,
as we have seen, the day after the
blind man entered the low lodging-house, he who,
up to that time, had been, even in his affliction,
earning his living, was taken out by one of the
“travellers,” and taught how much better a
living&mdash;how much more of the good things of this
world&mdash;he could get by mendicancy than by industry;
and from the very hour when the blind
man learnt this, the most dangerous lesson that
any human being can possibly be taught, he became,
heart and soul, an ingrained beggar. His
description of the delight he felt when he found
that he had no longer any need to work&mdash;that he
could rove about the country as he pleased&mdash;without
a care, without a purpose&mdash;with a perfect
sense of freedom, and a full enjoyment of the
open air in the day, and the wild licence of the
lodging-house society at night, satisfied that he
could get as much food and drink, and even
money as he needed, solely for the asking for
it; his description of this is a frank confession of
a few of the charms of vagabondism&mdash;charms to
which the more sedate are not only strangers, but
of which they can form no adequate conception.
The pleasure of “shaking a loose leg,” as the vagrants
themselves call it, is, perhaps, known only
in its intensity by those wayward spirits who
object to the restraint of work or the irksomeness
of any settled pursuit. The perfect <i>thoughtlessness</i>
that the blind man describes as the first
effect produced upon him by his vagabondism is the
more remarkable, because it seems to have effaced
from his mind all regard, even for the sister for
whose sake he had quitted his home&mdash;though to
those who have made a study of the vagrant character
it is one of those curious inconsistencies which
form the principal feature in the idiosyncrasy of
the class, and which, indeed, are a necessary
consequence of the very purposelessness, or want
of some permanent principle or feeling, which
constitutes, as it were, the mainspring of vagabondism.
Indeed, the blind man was a strange
compound of cunning and good feeling; at one
moment he was weeping over the afflictions of
others&mdash;he was deeply moved when I read to him
the sufferings of the Crippled Nutmeg-Grater Seller;
and yet, the next minute he was grinning behind
his hand, so that his laughter might be concealed
from me, in a manner that appeared almost
fiendish. Still, I am convinced that at heart he
was far from a bad man; there was, amid the
degradation that necessarily comes of habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
mendicancy, a fine expression of sympathy, that
the better class of poor always exhibit towards
the poor; nor could I help wondering when I
heard <i>him</i>&mdash;the professed mendicant&mdash;tell me
how he had been moved to tears by the recital of
the sufferings of another mendicant&mdash;sufferings
that might have been as profitable a stock in
trade to the one as his blindness was to the other;
though it is by no means unusual for objects of
charity to have <i>their</i> objects of charity, and to be
imposed upon by fictitious or exaggerated tales of
distress, almost as often as they impose upon
others by the very same means.</p>

<p>I now invite the reader’s attention to the narratives
given below as to the character of the low
lodging-houses. The individuals furnishing me
with those statements, it should be observed, were
not “picked” people, but taken promiscuously
from a number belonging to the same class. I
shall reserve what else I may have to remark on
the subject till the conclusion of those statements.</p>

<p>Prisons, tread-mills, penal settlements, gallows,
I said, eighteen months ago, in the ‘Morning
Chronicle,’ are all vain and impotent as punishments&mdash;and
Ragged Schools and City missions
are of no avail as preventives of crime&mdash;so long
as the wretched dens of infamy, brutality, and
vice, termed “padding-kens” continue their
daily and nightly work of demoralization. If we
would check the further spread of our criminals&mdash;and
within the last four years they have increased
from 24,000 to 30,000&mdash;we must apply ourselves
to the better regulation and conduct of these
places. At present they are not only the preparatory
schools, but the finishing academies for
every kind of profligacy and crime.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The system of lodging-houses for travellers, otherwise
trampers,” says the Constabulary Commissioners’
Report, “requires to be altogether revised; at present
they are in the practice of lodging all the worst characters
unquestioned, and are subject to no other control
than an occasional visit of inspection from the parish
officers, accompanied by the constables, whose power of
interference&mdash;if they have a legal right of entry&mdash;does
not extend to some of the most objectionable points connected
with those houses, as they can merely take into
custody such persons as they find in commission of some
offence. The state in which those houses are found on
the occasion of such visit, proves how much they require
interference. The houses are small, and yet as
many as thirty travellers, or even thirty-five, have been
found in one house; fifteen have been found sleeping in
one room, three or four in a bed&mdash;men, women, and
children, promiscuously: beds have been found occupied
in a cellar. It is not necessary to urge the many opportunities
of preparing for crime which such a state of
things presents, or the actual evils arising from such a
mode of harbouring crowds of low and vicious persons.”</p></div>

<p>According to the report of the Constabulary
Commissioners, there were in <span class="lock">1839&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Moreover, the same Report tells us, at p. 32,
that there is a low lodging-house for tramps in
every village. By the Post-office Directory there
are 3823 postal towns in England and Wales;
and assuming that in each of these towns there
are two “travellers’” houses, and that each of
these, upon an average, harbours every night ten
tramps (in a list given at p. 311, there were in
83 towns no less than 678 low lodging-houses,
receiving 10,860 lodgers every night; this gives,
on an average, 8 such houses to each town, and
16 lodgers to each such house), we have thus
76,460 for the total number of the inmates of
such houses.</p>

<p>To show the actual state of these lodging-houses
from the testimony of one who had been long
resident in them, I give the following statement.
It was made to me by a man of superior education
and intelligence (as the tone of his narrative
fully shows), whom circumstances, which do not
affect the object of my present letter, and therefore
need not be detailed, had reduced from affluence
to beggary, so that he was compelled to be
a constant resident in those places. All the other
statements that I obtained on the subject&mdash;and
they were numerous&mdash;were corroborative of his
account to the very <span class="lock">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have been familiar, unfortunately for me,
with low lodging-houses, both in town and country,
for more than ten years. I consider that, as
to the conduct of those places, it is worse in London
than in the country&mdash;while in the country
the character of the keeper is worse than in London,
although but a small difference can be noted.
The worst I am acquainted with, though I haven’t
been in it lately, is in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane&mdash;this
is the worst both for filth and for the
character of the lodgers. In the room where I
slept, which was like a barn in size, the tiles were
off the roof, and as there was no ceiling, I could
see the blue sky from where I lay. That may be
altered now. Here I slept in what was called the
single men’s room, and it was confined to men.
In another part of the house was a room for
married couples, as it was called, but of such
apartments I can tell you more concerning other
houses. For the bed with the view of the blue
sky I paid 3<i>d.</i> If it rained there was no shelter.
I have slept in a room in Brick-lane, Whitechapel,
in which were fourteen beds. In the next bed to
me, on the one side, was a man, his wife, and
three children, and a man and his wife on the
other. They were Irish people, and I believe the
women were the men’s wives&mdash;as the Irish women
generally are. Of all the women that resort to
these places the Irish are far the best for chastity.
All the beds were occupied, single men being
mixed with the married couples. The question is
never asked, when a man and woman go to a
lodging-house, if they are man and wife. All
must pay before they go to bed, or be turned into
the street. These beds were made&mdash;as all the
low lodging-house beds are&mdash;of the worst cotton
flocks stuffed in coarse, strong canvas. There is
a pair of sheets, a blanket, and a rug. I have
known the bedding to be unchanged for three
months; but that is not general. The beds are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
average size. Dirt is the rule with them, and
cleanliness the exception. They are all infested
with vermin. I never met with an exception.
No one is required to wash before going to bed in
any of these places (except at a very few, where
a very dirty fellow would not be admitted), unless
he has been walking on a wet day without
shoes or stockings, and then he must bathe his
feet. The people who slept in the room I am
describing were chiefly young men, almost all
accompanied by young females. I have seen girls
of fifteen sleep with ‘their chaps’&mdash;in some places
with youths of from sixteen to twenty. There is
no objection to any boy and girl occupying a bed,
even though the keeper knows they were previously
strangers to each other. The accommodation
for purposes of decency is very bad in some
places. A pail in the middle of a room, to which
both sexes may resort, is a frequent arrangement.
No delicacy or decency is ever observed. The
women are, I think, worse than the men. If any
one, possessing a sense of shame, says a word of
rebuke, he is at once assailed, by the women in
particular, with the coarsest words in the language.
The Irish women are as bad as the others with
respect to language, but I have known them keep
themselves covered in bed when the other women
were outraging modesty or decency. The Irish
will sleep anywhere to save a halfpenny a night,
if they have ever so much money.” [Here
he stated certain gross acts common to lodging-houses,
which cannot be detailed in print.] “It
is not uncommon for a boy or man to take a girl
out of the streets to these apartments. Some are
the same as common brothels, women being taken
in at all hours of the day or night. In most,
however, they must stay all night as a married
couple. In dressing or undressing there is no
regard to decency, while disgusting blackguardism
is often carried on in the conversation of the inmates.
I have known decent people, those that
are driven to such places from destitution, perhaps
for the first time, shocked and disgusted at what
they saw. I have seen a decent married pair so
shocked and disgusted that they have insisted on
leaving the place, and have left it. A great number
of the lodging-houses are large old buildings,
which were constructed for other purposes; these
houses are not so ill-ventilated, but even there,
where so many sleep in one room, the air is hot
and foul. In smaller rooms, say twelve feet by
nine, I have seen four beds placed for single men,
with no ventilation whatsoever, so that no one
could remain inside in warmish weather, without
every door and window open; another room in
the same house, a little larger, had four double
beds, with as many men and women, and perhaps
with children. The Board of Health last autumn
compelled the keepers of these places to whitewash
the walls and ceilings, and use limewash in other
places; before that, the walls and ceilings looked
as if they had been blackwashed, but still you
could see the bugs creeping along those black
walls, which were not black enough to hide
that. In some houses in the summer you can
hardly place your finger on a part of the wall
free from bugs. I have scraped them off by handfulls.</p>

<p>“Nothing can be worse to the health than these
places, without ventilation, cleanliness, or decency,
and with forty people’s breaths perhaps mingling
together in one foul choking steam of stench.
[The man’s own words.] They are the ready
resort of thieves and all bad characters, and the
keepers will hide them if they can from the police,
or facilitate any criminal’s escape. I never knew
the keepers give any offender up, even when rewards
were offered. If they did, they might
shut up shop. These houses are but receptacles,
with a few exceptions, for beggars, thieves, and
prostitutes, and those <i>in training</i> for thieves and
prostitutes&mdash;the exceptions are those who <i>must</i>
lodge at the lowest possible cost. I consider them
in every respect of the worst possible character,
and think that immediate means should be adopted
to improve them. Fights, and fierce fights too,
are frequent in them, and I have often been
afraid murder would be done. They are money-making
places, very. One person will own several&mdash;as
many as a dozen. In each house he has one
or more ‘deputies,’ chiefly men. Some of these
keepers are called respectable men; some live out
in the country, leaving all to deputies. They are
quite a separate class from the keepers of regular
brothels. In one house that I know they can
accommodate eighty single men; and when single
men only are admitted, what is decent, or rather
what is considered decent in such places, is less
unfrequent. Each man in such houses pays 4<i>d.</i> a
night, a bed to each man or boy; that is 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
nightly, or 486<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year, provided the
beds be full every night&mdash;and they are full six
nights out of seven. Besides that, some of the
beds supply double turns; for many get up at two
to go to Covent-garden or some other market, and
their beds are then let a second time to other
men; so that more than eighty are frequently
accommodated, and I suppose 500<i>l.</i> is the nearest
sum to be taken for an accurate return. The
rent is very trifling; the chief expense to be deducted
from the profits of the house in question is
the payment of three and sometimes four deputies,
receiving from 7<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a week each&mdash;say an
average of from 30<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;as three or
four are employed. Fire (coke being only used)
and gas are the other expenses. The washing is
a mere trifle. Then there are the parochial and the
water-rates. The rent is always low, as the
houses are useable for nothing but such lodgings.
The profits of the one house I have described
cannot be less than 300<i>l.</i> a year, and the others
are in proportion. Now, the owner of this house
has, I believe, 10 more such houses, which, letting
only threepenny beds (some are lower than that),
may realise a profit of about 200<i>l.</i> a year each.
These altogether yield a clear profit of 2300<i>l.</i> for
the eleven of them; but on how much vice and
disease that 2300<i>l.</i> has been raised is a question
beyond a schoolmaster. The missionaries visit
these lodging-houses, but, judging from what I
have heard said by the inmates in all of them,
when the missionaries have left, scarcely any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
good effect has resulted from the visits. <i>I never
saw a clergyman of any denomination in any
one of these places, either in town or country.</i> In
London the master or deputy of the low lodging-house
does not generally meddle with the disposal
of stolen property, as in the country. This is
talked about, alike in the town and country
houses, very openly and freely before persons
known only to be beggars, and never stealing: it
is sufficient that they are known as tramps. In
London the keepers must all know that stolen
property is nightly brought into the house, and
they wink at its disposal, but they won’t mix
themselves up with disposing of it. If it be provisions
that have been stolen, they are readily
disposed of to the other inmates, and the owner
or deputy of the house may know nothing about
it, and certainly would not care to interfere if he
did. I never heard robberies planned there, but
there are generally strangers present, and this
may deter. I believe more robberies are planned
in low coffee-shops than in lodging-houses. The
influence of the lodging-house society on boys who
have run away from their parents, and have got
thither, either separately or in company with lads
who have joined them in the streets, is this:&mdash;Boys
there, after paying their lodgings, may
exercise the same freedom from every restraint as
they see the persons of maturer years enjoy. This
is often pleasant to a boy, especially if he has
been severely treated by his parents or master;
he apes, and often outdoes, all the men’s ways,
both in swearing and lewd talk, and so he gets a
relish for that sort of life. After he has resorted
to such places&mdash;the sharper boys for three, and
the duller for six months&mdash;they are adepts at any
thieving or vice. Drunkenness, and even moderate
drinking, is very rare among them. I
seldom or never see the boys drink&mdash;indeed,
thieves of all ages are generally sober men. Once
get to like a lodging-house life, and a boy can
hardly be got out of it. I said the other day to
a youth, ‘I wish I could get out of these haunts
and never see a lodging-house again;’ and he
replied, ‘If I had ever so much money I would
never live anywhere else.’ I have seen the boys
in a lodging-house sit together telling stories, but
paid no attention to them.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a Young Pickpocket.</span></h3>

<p>To show the class of characters usually frequenting
these lodging-houses, I will now give the
statement of a boy&mdash;a young pickpocket&mdash;without
shoes or stockings. He wore a ragged, dirty, and
very thin great coat, of some dark jean or linen,
under which was another thin coat, so arranged
that what appeared rents&mdash;and, indeed, were rents,
but designedly made&mdash;in the outer garment, were
slits through which the hand readily reached
the pockets of the inner garment, and could
there deposit any booty. He was a slim, agile lad,
with a sharp but not vulgar expression, and small
features. His hands were of singular delicacy and
beauty. His fingers were very long, and no lady’s
could have been more taper. A burglar told me
that with such a hand he ought to have made his
fortune. He was worth 20<i>l.</i> a week, he said, as
a “<i>wire</i>,” that is, a picker of ladies’ pockets.
When engaged “for a turn,” as he told me he
once was by an old pickpocket, the man looked
minutely at his fingers, and approved of them
highly. His hands, the boy said, were hardly
serviceable to him when very cold. His feet were
formed in the same symmetrical and beautiful
mould as his hands. “I am 15,” he said. “My
father was a potter, and I can’t recollect my mother” (many
of the thieves are orphans or
motherless). “My father has been dead about
five years. I was then working at the pottery
in High-street, Lambeth, earning about 4<i>s.</i> a
week; in good weeks, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I was in work
eight months after my father died; but one
day I broke three bottles by accident, and the foreman
said ‘I shan’t want you any more;’ and I took
that as meant for a discharge; but I found afterwards
that he did’nt so mean it. I had 2<i>s.</i> and
a suit of clothes then, and tried for work at all
the potteries; but I couldn’t get any. It was
about the time Smithfield fair was on. I went,
but it was a very poor concern. I fell asleep in
a pen in the afternoon, and had my shoes stolen
off my feet. When I woke up, I began crying.
A fellow named Gyp then came along (I knew his
name afterwards), and he said, ‘What are you
crying for?’ and I told him, and he said, ‘Pull off
your stockings, and come with me, and I’ll show
you where to sleep.’ So I did, and he took me to
St. Olave’s workhouse, having first sold my stockings.
I had never stolen anything until then.
There I slept in the casual ward, and Gyp slept
there too. In the morning we started together for
Smithfield, where he said he had a job to sweep the
pens, but he couldn’t sweep them without pulling
off his coat, and it would look so queer if he hadn’t
a shirt&mdash;and he hadn’t one. He promised to
teach me how to make a living in the country if I
would lend him mine, and I was persuaded&mdash;for
I was an innocent lad then&mdash;and went up
a gateway and stripped off my shirt and gave
it to him, and soon after he went into a public-house
to get half a pint of beer; he went in at
one door and out at another, and I didn’t see
him for six months afterwards. That afternoon I
went into Billingsgate market and met some boys,
and one said, ‘Mate, how long have you been
knocking about; where did you doss?’ I didn’t
know what they meant, and when they’d told me
they meant where did I sleep? I told them how
I’d been served. And they said, ‘Oh! you must
expect that, until you learn something,’ and they
laughed. They all know’d Gyp; he was like the
head of a Billingsgate gang once. I became a pal
with these boys at Billingsgate, and we went about
stealing fish and meat. Some boys have made 2<i>s.</i>
in a morning, when fish is dear&mdash;those that had
pluck and luck; they sold it at half-price. Billingsgate
market is a good place to sell it; plenty
of costermongers are there who will buy it,
rather than of the salesmen. I soon grew as bad
as the rest at this work. At first I sold it to other
boys, who would get 3<i>d.</i> for what they bought
at 1<i>d.</i> Now they can’t do me. If I can get a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
cheap where I lodge, and have the money, and can
sell it dear, that’s the chance. I carried on this fish
rig for about two years, and went begging a little,
too. I used to try a little thieving sometimes in
Petticoat-lane. They say the ‘fliest’ is easy to
take in sometimes&mdash;that’s the artfullest; but I
could do no good there. At these two years’
end, I was often as happy as could be; that is,
when I had made money. Then I met B&mdash;&mdash;,
whom I had often heard of as an uncommon clever
pickpocket; he could do it about as well as I
can now, so as people won’t feel it. Three of his
mates were transported for stealing silver plate.
He and I became pals, and started for the
country with 1<i>d.</i> We went through Foot’s Cray,
and passed a farm where a man’s buried at the top
of a house; there’s something about money while
a man’s above ground; I don’t understand it, but
it’s something like that. A baker, about thirty
miles from London, offended us about some bread;
and B&mdash;&mdash; said ‘I’ll serve him out.’ We watched
him out, and B&mdash;&mdash; tried at his pocket, saying,
‘I’ll show you how to do a handkerchief;’ but the
baker looked round, and B&mdash;&mdash; stopped; and just
after that I flared it (whisked the handkerchief out);
and that’s the first I did. It brought 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> We
travelled across country, and got to Maidstone, and
did two handkerchiefs. One I wore round my neck,
and the other the lodging-housekeeper pawned for
us for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In Maidstone, next morning, I was
nailed, and had three months of it. I didn’t mind
it so much then, but Maidstone’s far worse now,
I’ve heard. I have been in prison three times in
Brixton, three times in the Old Horse (Bridewell),
three times in the Compter, once in the Steel, and
once in Maidstone&mdash;thirteen times in all, including
twice I was remanded, and got off; but I don’t
reckon that prison. Every time I came out harder
than I went in. I’ve had four floggings; it was
bad enough&mdash;a flogging was&mdash;while it lasted; but
when I got out I soon forgot it. At a week’s end
I never thought again about it. If I had been
better treated I should have been a better lad. I
could leave off thieving now as if I had never
thieved, if I could live without.” [I am inclined
to doubt this part of the statement.] “I have
carried on this sort of life until now. I didn’t often
make a very good thing of it. I saw Manning and
his wife hung. Mrs. Manning was dressed beautiful
when she came up. She screeched when Jack
Ketch pulled the bolt away. She was harder
than Manning, they all said; without her there
would have been no murder. It was a great deal
talked about, and Manning was pitied. It was a
punishment to her to come on the scaffold and see
Manning with the rope about his neck, if people
takes it in the right light. I did 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at the
hanging&mdash;two handkerchiefs, and a purse with 2<i>s.</i>
in it&mdash;the best purse I ever had; but I’ve only
done three or four purses. The reason is, because
I’ve never been well dressed. If I went near a
lady, she would say, ‘Tush, tush, you ragged
fellow!’ and would shrink away. But I would
rather rob the rich than the poor; they miss it
less. But 1<i>s.</i> honest goes further than 5<i>s.</i> stolen.
Some call that only a saying, but it’s true. All
the money I got soon went&mdash;most of it a-gambling.
Picking pockets, when any one comes to think on
it, is the daringest thing that a boy can do. It
didn’t in the least frighten me to see Manning and
Mrs. Manning hanged. I never thought I should
come to the gallows, and I never shall&mdash;I’m not
high-tempered enough for that. The only thing that
frightens me when I’m in prison is sleeping in a
cell by myself&mdash;you do in the Old Horse and the
Steel&mdash;because I think things may appear. You
can’t imagine how one dreams when in trouble.
I’ve often started up in a fright from a dream. I
don’t know what might appear. I’ve heard people
talk about ghosts and that. Once, in the County,
a tin had been left under a tap that went drip&mdash;drip&mdash;drip.
And all in the ward were shocking
frightened; and weren’t we glad when we found
out what it was! Boys tell stories about haunted
castles, and cats that are devils; and that frightens
one. At the fire in Monument-yard I did 5<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>&mdash;3<i>s.</i>
in silver and 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> in handkerchiefs, and
4<i>d.</i> for three pairs of gloves. I sell my handkerchiefs
in the Lane (Petticoat-lane). I carry on
this trade still. Most times I’ve got in prison is
when I’ve been desperate from hunger, and have
said to B&mdash;&mdash;, ‘Now I’ll have money, nailed or
not nailed.’ I can pick a woman’s pocket as easy
as a man’s, though you wouldn’t think it. If one’s
in prison for begging, one’s laughed at. The others
say, ‘Begging! Oh, you cadger!’ So a boy is
partly forced to steal for his character. I’ve lived
a good deal in lodging-houses, and know the ways
of them. They are very bad places for a boy to
be in. Where I am now, when the place is full,
there’s upwards of 100 can be accommodated. I
won’t be there long. I’ll do something to get out
of it. There’s people there will rob their own
brother. There’s people there talk backward&mdash;for
one they say <i>eno</i>, for two <i>owt</i>, for three <i>eerht</i>,
for four <i>ruof</i>, for five <i>evif</i>, for six <i>exis</i>. I don’t
know any higher. I can neither read nor write.
In this lodging-house there are no women. They
talk there chiefly about what they’ve done, or are
going to do, or have set their minds upon, just as
you and any other gentlemen might do. I have
been in lodging-houses in Mint-street and Kent-street,
where men and women and children all
slept in one room. I think the men and women
who slept together were generally married, or lived
together; but it’s not right for a big boy to sleep
in the same room. Young men have had beds to
themselves, and so have young women there; but
there’s a deputy comes into the room, every now
and then, to see there’s nothing wrong. There’s
little said in these places, the people are generally
so tired. Where I am there’s horrid language&mdash;swearing,
and everything that’s bad. They are to
be pitied, because there’s not work for honest
people, let alone thieves. In the lodging-houses
the air is very bad, enough to stifle one in bed&mdash;so
many breaths together. Without such places
my trade couldn’t be carried on; I couldn’t live.
Some though would find another way out. Three
or four would take a room among them. Anybody’s
money’s good&mdash;you can always get a
room. I would be glad to leave this life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
work at a pottery. As to sea, a bad captain
would make me run away&mdash;sure. He can do
what he likes with you when you’re out at sea.
I don’t get more than 2<i>s.</i> a week, one week with
the other, by thieving; some days you do nothing
until hunger makes your spirits rise. I can’t
thieve on a full belly. I live on 2<i>s.</i> a week from
thieving, because I understand fiddling&mdash;that
means, buying a thing for a mere trifle, and selling
it for double, or for more, if you’re not taken in
yourself. I’ve been put up to a few tricks in
lodging-houses, and now I can put others up to it.
Everybody must look after themselves, and I
can’t say I was very sorry when I stole that 2<i>s.</i>
from a poor woman, but I’d rather have had
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> from a rich one. I never drink&mdash;eating’s
my part. I spend chief part of my money in
pudding. I don’t like living in lodging-houses,
but I must like it as I’m placed now&mdash;that sort
of living, and those lodging-houses, or starving.
They bring tracts to the lodging-houses&mdash;pipes are
lighted with them; tracts won’t fill your belly.
Tracts is no good, except to a person that has a
home; at the lodging-houses they’re laughed at.
They seldom are mentioned. I’ve heard some of
them read by missionaries, but can’t catch anything
from them. If it had been anything bad, I
should have caught it readily. If an innocent
boy gets into a lodging-house, he’ll not be innocent
long&mdash;he can’t. I know three boys who
have run away, and are in the lodging-houses still,
but I hope their father has caught them. Last
night a little boy came to the lodging-house where
I was. We all thought he had run away, by the
way he spoke. He stayed all night, but was
found out in two or three falsehoods. I wanted
to get him back home, or he’ll be as bad as I am
in time, though he’s nothing to me; but I
couldn’t find him this morning; but I’ll get him
home yet, perhaps. The Jews in Petticoat-lane
are terrible rogues. They’ll buy anything of you&mdash;they’ll
buy what you’ve stolen from their next-door
neighbours&mdash;that they would, if they knew
it. But they’ll give you very little for it, and
they threaten to give you up if you won’t take a
quarter of the value of it. ‘Oh! I shee you do
it,’ they say, ‘and I like to shee him robbed, but
you musht take vot I give.’ I wouldn’t mind
what harm came to those Petticoat-laners. Many
of them are worth thousands, though you wouldn’t
think it.” After this I asked him what he, as a
sharp lad, thought was the cause of so many boys
becoming vagrant pickpockets? He answered,
“Why, sir, if boys runs away, and has to shelter
in low lodging-houses&mdash;and many runs away from
cruel treatment at home&mdash;they meet there with
boys such as me, or as bad, and the devil soon
lays his hand on them. If there wasn’t so many
lodging-houses there wouldn’t be so many bad
boys&mdash;there couldn’t. Lately a boy came down
to Billingsgate, and said he wouldn’t stay at
home to be knocked about any longer. He said
it to some boys like me; and he was asked if he
could get anything from his mother, and he said
‘yes, he could.’ So he went back, and brought
a brooch and some other things with him to a
place fixed on, and then he and some of the boys
set off for the country; and that’s the way boys
is trapped. I think the fathers of such boys
either ill-treat them, or neglect them; and so they
run away. My father used to beat me shocking;
so I hated home. I stood hard licking well, and
was called ‘the plucked one.’” This boy first
stole flowers, currants, and gooseberries out of the
clergyman’s garden, more by way of bravado, and
to ensure the approbation of his comrades, than
for anything else. He answered readily to my
inquiry, as to what he thought would become of
him?&mdash;“Transportation. If a boy has great luck
he may carry on for eight years. Three or four
years is the common run, but transportation is
what he’s sure to come to in the end.” This lad
picked my pocket at my request, and so dexterously
did he do his “work,” that though I was
alive to what he was trying to do, it was impossible
for me to detect the least movement of my
coat. To see him pick the pockets, as he did, of
some of the gentlemen who were present on the
occasion, was a curious sight. He crept behind
much like a cat with his claws out, and while in
the act held his breath with suspense; but immediately
the handkerchief was safe in his hand, the
change in the expression of his countenance was
most marked. He then seemed almost to be convulsed
with delight at the success of his perilous
adventure, and, turning his back, held up the handkerchief
to discover the value of his prize, with
intense glee evident in every feature.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a Prostitute.</span></h3>

<p>The narrative which follows&mdash;that of a prostitute,
sleeping in the low-lodging houses, where
boys and girls are all huddled promiscuously together,
discloses a system of depravity, atrocity, and
enormity, which certainly cannot be paralleled in
any nation, however barbarous, nor in any age,
however “dark.” The facts detailed, it will be
seen, are gross enough to make us all blush for
the land in which such scenes can be daily perpetrated.
The circumstances, which it is impossible
to publish, are of the most loathsome and
revolting nature.</p>

<p>A good-looking girl of sixteen gave me the following
awful <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am an orphan. When I was ten I was
sent to service as maid of all-work, in a small
tradesman’s family. It was a hard place, and my
mistress used me very cruelly, beating me often.
When I had been in place three weeks, my mother
died; my father having died twelve years before.
I stood my mistress’s ill-treatment for about six
months. She beat me with sticks as well as with
her hands. I was black and blue, and at last I
ran away. I got to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, a low lodging-house.
I didn’t know before that there was such
a place. I heard of it from some girls at the
Glasshouse (baths and washhouses), where I went
for shelter. I went with them to have a halfpenny
worth of coffee, and they took me to the lodging-house.
I then had three shillings, and stayed
about a month, and did nothing wrong, living on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the three shillings and what I pawned my clothes
for, as I got some pretty good things away with
me. In the lodging-house I saw nothing but what
was bad, and heard nothing but what was bad. I
was laughed at, and was told to swear. They
said, ‘Look at her for a d&mdash;&mdash; modest fool’&mdash;sometimes
worse than that, until by degrees I got
to be as bad as they were. During this time I
used to see boys and girls from ten and twelve
years old sleeping together, but understood nothing
wrong. I had never heard of such places before I
ran away. I can neither read nor write. My
mother was a good woman, and I wish I’d had
her to run away to. I saw things between almost
children that I can’t describe to you&mdash;very often I
saw them, and that shocked me. At the month’s
end, when I was beat out, I met with a young
man of fifteen&mdash;I myself was going on to twelve
years old&mdash;and he persuaded me to take up with
him. I stayed with him three months in the same
lodging-house, living with him as his wife, though
we were mere children, and being true to him.
At the three months’ end he was taken up for
picking pockets, and got six months. I was sorry,
for he was kind to me; though I was made ill
through him; so I broke some windows in St.
Paul’s-churchyard to get into prison to get cured.
I had a month in the Compter, and came out well.
I was scolded very much in the Compter, on account
of the state I was in, being so young. I
had 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> given to me when I came out, and was
forced to go into the streets for a living. I continued
walking the streets for three years, sometimes
making a good deal of money, sometimes
none, feasting one day and starving the next. The
bigger girls could persuade me to do anything they
liked with my money. I was never happy all the
time, but I could get no character and could not
get out of the life. I lodged all this time at a
lodging-house in Kent-street. They were all thieves
and bad girls. I have known between three and
four dozen boys and girls sleep in one room. The
beds were horrid filthy and full of vermin. There
was very wicked carryings on. The boys, if any
difference, was the worst. We lay packed on a
full night, a dozen boys and girls squeedged into
one bed. That was very often the case&mdash;some at
the foot and some at the top&mdash;boys and girls all
mixed. I can’t go into all the particulars, but
whatever could take place in words or acts between
boys and girls did take place, and in the midst of
the others. I am sorry to say I took part in these
bad ways myself, but I wasn’t so bad as some of
the others. There was only a candle burning all
night, but in summer it was light great part of the
night. Some boys and girls slept without any
clothes, and would dance about the room that way.
I have seen them, and, wicked as I was, felt
ashamed. I have seen two dozen capering about
the room that way; some mere children, the boys
generally the youngest. * * * *
There were no men or women present. There were
often fights. The deputy never interfered. This
is carried on just the same as ever to this day, and
is the same every night. I have heard young
girls shout out to one another how often they had
been obliged to go to the hospital, or the infirmary,
or the workhouse. There was a great deal of
boasting about what the boys and girls had stolen
during the day. I have known boys and girls
change their ‘partners,’ just for a night. At three
years’ end I stole a piece of beef from a butcher.
I did it to get into prison. I was sick of the life
I was leading, and didn’t know how to get out of
it. I had a month for stealing. When I got out
I passed two days and a night in the streets doing
nothing wrong, and then went and threatened to
break Messrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; windows again. I did that
to get into prison again; for when I lay quiet of a
night in prison I thought things over, and considered
what a shocking life I was leading, and how
my health might be ruined completely, and I
thought I would stick to prison rather than go back
to such a life. I got six months for threatening.
When I got out I broke a lamp next morning for
the same purpose, and had a fortnight. That was
the last time I was in prison. I have since been
leading the same life as I told you of for the three
years, and lodging at the same houses, and seeing
the same goings on. I hate such a life now more
than ever. I am willing to do any work that I
can in washing and cleaning. I can do a little at
my needle. I could do hard work, for I have
good health. I used to wash and clean in prison,
and always behaved myself there. At the house
where I am it is 3<i>d.</i> a night; but at Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;’s
it is 1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> a night, and just the same goings
on. Many a girl&mdash;nearly all of them&mdash;goes out
into the streets from this penny and twopenny
house, to get money for their favourite boys by
prostitution. If the girl cannot get money she
must steal something, or will be beaten by her
‘chap’ when she comes home. I have seen them
beaten, often kicked and beaten until they were
blind from bloodshot, and their teeth knocked out
with kicks from boots as the girl lays on the
ground. The boys, in their turn, are out thieving
all day, and the lodging-housekeeper will buy any
stolen provisions of them, and sell them to the
lodgers. I never saw the police in the house. If
a boy comes to the house on a night without money
or sawney, or something to sell to the lodgers, a
handkerchief or something of that kind, he is not
admitted, but told very plainly, ‘Go thieve it,
then.’ Girls are treated just the same. Any
body may call in the daytime at this house and
have a halfpennyworth of coffee and sit any length
of time until evening. I have seen three dozen
sitting there that way, all thieves and bad girls.
There are no chairs, and only one form in front of
the fire, on which a dozen can sit. The others
sit on the floor all about the room, as near the
fire as they can. Bad language goes on during the
day, as I have told you it did during the night,
and indecencies too, but nothing like so bad as at
night. They talk about where there is good
places to go and thieve. The missioners call
sometimes, but they’re laughed at often when
they’re talking, and always before the door’s
closed on them. If a decent girl goes there to
get a ha’porth of coffee, seeing the board over the
door, she is always shocked. Many a poor girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
has been ruined in this house since I was, and
boys have boasted about it. I never knew boy
or girl do good, once get used there. Get used
there, indeed, and you are life-ruined. I was an
only child, and haven’t a friend in the world. I
have heard several girls say how they would like
to get out of the life, and out of the place. From
those I know, I think that cruel parents and mistresses
cause many to be driven there. One
lodging-house keeper, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, goes out dressed
respectable, and pawns any stolen property, or
sells it at public-houses.”</p>

<p>As a corroboration of the girl’s statement, a
wretched-looking boy, only thirteen years of age,
gave me the following additional information. He
had a few rags hanging about him, and no shirt&mdash;indeed,
he was hardly covered enough for purposes
of decency, his skin being exposed through
the rents in his jacket and trowsers. He had a
stepfather, who treated him very cruelly. The
stepfather and the child’s mother went “across
the country,” begging and stealing. Before the
mother died, an elder brother ran away on account
of being <span class="lock">beaten:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes (I give his own words) he (the
stepfather) wouldn’t give us a bit to eat, telling us
to go and thieve for it. My brother had been
a month gone (he’s now a soldier in Gibraltar)
when I ran away to join him. I knew where to
find him, as we met sometimes. We lived by
thieving, and I do still&mdash;by pulling flesh (stealing
meat). I got to lodge at Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, and have
been there this eight months. I can read and
write a little.” [This boy then confirmed what
the young girl had told me of the grossest acts
night by night among the boys and girls, the language,
&amp;c., and continued]&mdash;“I always sleep on
the floor for 1<i>d.</i> and pay a &frac12;<i>d.</i> besides for coke.
At this lodging-house cats and kittens are melted
down, sometimes twenty a day. A quart pot is a
cat, and pints and half pints are kittens. A kitten
(pint) brings 3<i>d.</i> from the rag shops, and a
cat 6<i>d.</i> There’s convenience to melt them down
at the lodging-house. We can’t sell clothes in
the house, except any lodger wants them; and
clothes nearly all goes to the Jews in Petticoat-lane.
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; buys the sawney of us; so
much for the lump, 2<i>d.</i> a pound about; she sells it
again for twice what she gives, and more. Perhaps
30 lb. of meat every day is sold to her. I
have been in prison six times, and have had three
dozen; each time I came out harder. If I left
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;’s house I don’t know how I could get
my living. Lots of boys would get away if they
could. I never drink, I don’t like it. Very few
of us boys drink. I don’t like thieving, and often
go about singing; but I can’t live by singing, and
I don’t know how I could live honestly. If I
had money enough to buy a stock of oranges
I think I could be honest.”</p>

<p>The above facts require no comment from me.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a Beggar.</span></h3>

<p>A beggar decently attired, and with a simple
and what some would call even a respectable look,
gave me the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am now twenty-eight, and have known all
connected with the begging trade since I was fourteen.
My grandfather (mother’s father) was rich,
owning three parts of the accommodation houses
in St. Giles’s; he allowed me 2<i>s.</i> a week pocket-money.
My grandfather kept the great house, the
old Rose and Crown, in Church-lane, opposite
Carver-street, best known as the ‘Beggar’s Opera.’
When a child of seven, I have seen the place
crowded&mdash;crammed with nothing but beggars,
first-rates&mdash;none else used the house. The money
I saw in the hands of the beggars made a great
impression upon me. My father took away my
mother’s money. I wish my mother had run
away instead. He was kind, but she was always
nagging. My father was a foreman in a foundry.
I got a situation in the same foundry after my
father cut. Once I was sent to a bank with a
cheque for 38<i>l.</i> to get cashed, in silver, for wages.
In coming away, I met a companion of mine, and
he persuaded me to bolt with the money, and go
to Ashley’s. The money was too much for my
head to carry. I fooled all that money away. I
wasn’t in bed for more than a fortnight. I bought
linnets in cages for the fancy of my persuader. In
fact, I didn’t know what use to put the money to.
I was among plenty of girls. When the money
was out I was destitute. I couldn’t go back to my
employers, and I couldn’t face my mother’s temper&mdash;that
was worse; but for that nagging of hers I
shouldn’t have been as I am. She has thrashed
me with a hand broom until I was silly; there’s the
bumps on my head still; and yet that woman would
have given me her heart’s blood to do me a good.
As soon as I found myself quite destitute, I
went wandering about the City, picking up the
skins of gooseberries and orange peel to eat, to
live on&mdash;things my stomach would turn at now.
At last my mother came to hear that I tried
to destroy myself. She paid the 38<i>l.</i>, and my
former employers got me a situation in Paddington.
I was there a month, and then I met him
as advised me to steal the money before&mdash;he’s
called the ex-king of the costermongers now.
Well he was crying hareskins, and advised me
again to bolt, and I went with him. My mind
was bent upon costermongering and a roving
life. I couldn’t settle to anything. I wanted to
be away when I was at work, and when I was
away I wanted to be back again. It was difficult
for me to stick to anything for five minutes together;
it is so now. What I begin I can’t finish at
the time&mdash;unless it’s a pot of beer. Well, in four
days my adviser left me; he had no more use for
me. I was a flat. He had me for a “go-along,”
to cry his things for him. Then, for the first time
in my life, I went into a low lodging-house. There
was forty men and women sleeping in one room. I
had to sleep with a black man, and I slept on the
floor to get away from the fellow. There were
plenty of girls there; some playing cards and
dominoes. It was very dirty&mdash;old Mother &mdash;&mdash;,
in Lawrence-lane&mdash;the Queen of Hell she was
called. There was one tub among the lot of
us. I felt altogether disgusted. Those who
lived there were beggars, thieves, smashers, coiners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
purchasers of begged and stolen goods, and prostitutes.
The youngest prostitute was twelve, and
so up to fifty. The beastliest language went on.
It’s done to outrival one another. There I met
with a man called Tom Shallow (<i>shallow</i> is cant
for half-naked), and he took me out ballad-singing,
and when we couldn’t get on at that (the songs
got dead) he left me. I made him 10<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i> a
day in them days, but he only gave me my lodgings
and grub (but not half enough), and two
pipes of tobacco a day to keep the hunger down,
that I mightn’t be expensive. I then ’listed. I
was starving, and couldn’t raise a lodging. I took
the shilling, but was rejected by the doctor. I
’listed again at Chatham afterwards, but was rejected
again. I stayed jobbing among the soldiers
for some weeks, and then they gave me an old regimental
suit, and with that I came to London.
One gave me a jacket, and another a pair of
military trowsers, and another a pair of old ammunition
boots, and so on. About that time a
batch of invalids came from Spain, where they
had been under General Evans. On my way up
from Chatham, I met at Gravesend with seven
chaps out on ‘<i>the Spanish lurk</i>’ as they called it&mdash;that
is, passing themselves off as wounded men
of the Spanish Legion. Two <i>had been</i> out in Spain,
and managed the business if questions were asked;
the others were regular English beggars, who had
never been out of the country. I joined them as
a serjeant, as I had a sergeant’s jacket given me
at Chatham. On our way to London&mdash;‘the school’
(as the lot is called) came all together&mdash;we picked
up among us 4<i>l.</i> and 5<i>l.</i> a day&mdash;no matter where
we went. ‘The school’ all slept in lodging houses,
and I at last began to feel comfortable in them. We
spent our evenings in eating out-and-out suppers.
Sometimes we had such things as sucking pigs,
hams, mince pies&mdash;indeed we lived on the best.
No nobleman could live better in them days. So
much wine, too! I drank in such excess, my nose
was as big as that there letter stamp; so that I
got a sickening of it. We gave good victuals
away that was given to us&mdash;it was a nuisance to
carry them. It cost us from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a day to
have our shoes cleaned by <i>poor</i> tramps, and for
clean dickies. The clean dodge is always the
best for begging upon. At Woolwich we were
all on the fuddle at the Dust Hole, and our two
spokesmen were drunk; and I went to beg of
Major &mdash;&mdash;, whose brother was then in Spain&mdash;he
himself had been out previously. Meeting
the major at his own house, I said, ‘I was a
sergeant in the 3rd Westminster Grenadiers, you
know, and served under your brother.’ ‘Oh! yes,
that’s my brother’s regiment,’ says he. ‘Where
was you, then, on the 16th of October?’ ‘Why,
sir, I was at the taking of the city of Irun,’ says
I&mdash;(in fact, I was at that time with the costermonger
in St. Giles’s, calling cabbages, ‘white
heart cabbages, oh!’) Then said the major,
‘What day was Ernani taken on?’ ‘Why,’ said
I (I was a little tipsy, and bothered at the question),
‘that was the 16th of October, too.’ ‘Very
well, my man,’ says he, tapping his boots with a
riding whip he held, ‘I’ll see what I can do for
you;’ and the words were no sooner out of his
mouth than he stepped up to me and gave me a
regular pasting. He horsewhipped me up and
down stairs, and all along the passages; my flesh
was like sassages. I managed at last, however,
to open the door myself, and get away. After
that ‘the school’ came to London. In a day we
used to make from 8<i>l.</i> to 10<i>l.</i> among us, by walking
up Regent-street, Bond-street, Piccadilly, Pall-mall,
Oxford-street, the parks&mdash;those places were
the best beats. All the squares were good too.
It was only like a walk out for air, and your 25<i>s.</i>
a man for it. At night we used to go to plays,
dressed like gentlemen. At first the beaks protected
us, but we got found out, and the beaks
grew rusty. The thing got so overdone, every
beggar went out as a Spanish lurksman. Well,
the beaks got up to the dodge, and all the Spanish
lurksmen in their turns got to work the universal
staircase, under the care of Lieutenant Tracy (Tothill-fields
treadmill). The men that had really
been out and got disabled were sent to that staircase
at last, and I thought I would try a fresh
lurk. So I went under the care and tuition of a
sailor. He had been a sailor. I became a <i>turnpike
sailor</i>, as it’s called, and went out as one of
the Shallow Brigade, wearing a Guernsey shirt
and drawers, or tattered trowsers. There was a
school of four. We only got a tidy living&mdash;16<i>s.</i>
or 1<i>l.</i> a day among us. We used to call every
one that came along&mdash;coalheavers and all&mdash;sea-fighting
captains. ‘Now, my noble sea-fighting
captain,’ we used to say, ‘fire an odd shot from
your larboard locker to us, Nelson’s bull-dogs;’
but mind we never tried that dodge on at Greenwich,
for fear of the old geese, the Collegemen.
The Shallow got so grannied (known) in London,
that the supplies got queer, and I quitted the land
navy. Shipwrecks got so common in the streets,
you see, that people didn’t care for them, and
I dropped getting cast away. I then took to
<i>screeving</i> (writing on the stones). I got my head
shaved, and a cloth tied round my jaws, and
wrote on the <span class="lock">flags&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">
‘<i>Illness and Want</i>,’<br />
</p>

<p>though I was never better in my life, and always
had a good bellyfull before I started of a morning.
I did very well at first: 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> a day&mdash;sometimes
more&mdash;till I got grannied. There is one
man who draws Christ’s heads with a crown of
thorns, and mackerel, on the pavement, in coloured
chalks (there are four or five others at the same business);
this one, however, often makes 1<i>l.</i> a day
now in three hours; indeed, I have known him
come home with 21<i>s.</i>, besides what he drank on the
way. A gentleman who met him in Regent-street
once gave him 5<i>l.</i> and a suit of clothes to do
Christ’s heads with a crown of thorns and mackerel
on the walls. His son does Napoleon’s heads best,
but makes nothing like so much as the father.
The father draws cats’ heads and salmon as well&mdash;but
the others are far the best spec. He will
often give thirteen-pence, and indeed fourteen-pence,
for a silver shilling, to get rid of the coppers.
This man’s pitch is Lloyd-square, not far
from Sadler’s Wells. I have seen him commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
his pitch there at half-past eleven, to catch the
people come from the theatre. He is very clever.
In wet weather, and when I couldn’t chalk, as
I couldn’t afford to lose time, I used to dress tidy
and very clean for the ‘<i>respectable broken-down
tradesman or reduced gentleman</i>’ caper. I wore
a suit of black, generally, and a clean dickey, and
sometimes old black kid gloves, and I used to
stand with a paper before my face, as if <span class="lock">ashamed&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">
‘<i>To a Humane Public.<br />
‘I have seen better days.</i>’<br />
</p>

<p>This is called standing pad with a fakement. It
is a wet-weather dodge, and isn’t so good as
screeving, but I did middling, and can’t bear
being idle. After this I mixed with the street
patterers (men who make speeches in the streets)
on <i>the destitute mechanics’ lurk</i>. We went in a
school of six at first, all in clean aprons, and spoke
every man in his turn. It won’t do unless you’re
clean. Each man wanted a particular article of
dress. One had no shirt&mdash;another no shoes&mdash;another
no hat&mdash;and so on. No two wanted the
same. We <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Kind and benevolent Christians!&mdash;It is with feelings
of deep regret, and sorrow and shame, that us unfortunate
tradesmen are compelled to appear before you
this day, to ask charity from the hands of strangers.
We are brought to it from want&mdash;I may say, actual starvation.’
(We always had a good breakfast before we
started, and some of us, sir, was full up to the brim of
liquor.) ‘But what will not hunger and the cries of
children compel men to do.’ (We were all single men.)
‘When we left our solitary and humble homes this
morning, our children were crying for food, but if a
farthing would have saved their lives, we hadn’t it to
give them. I assure you, kind friends, me, my wife,
and three children, would have been houseless wanderers
all last night, but I sold the shirt from off my back as
you may see (opening my jacket) to pay for a lodging.
We are, kind friends, <i>English</i> mechanics. It is hard
that you wont give your own countrymen a penny,
when you give so much to <i>foreign</i> hurdy-gurdies and
organ-grinders. Owing to the introduction of steam and
machinery and foreign manufactures we have been
brought to this degraded state. Fellow countrymen,
there are at this moment 4000 men like ourselves, able
and willing to work, but can’t get it, and forced to wander
the streets. I hope and trust some humane Christian
within the sound of my voice will stretch out a hand
with a small trifle for us, be it ever so small, or a bit of
dry bread or cold potato, or anything turned from your
table, it would be of the greatest benefit to us and our
poor children.’ (Then we would whisper to one another,
‘I hope they won’t bring out any scran&mdash;only coppers.’)
‘We have none of us tasted food this blessed
day. We have been told to go to our parishes, but that
we cannot brook; to be torn from our wives and families
is heart-rending to think of&mdash;may God save us all from
the Bastile!’ (We always pattered hard at the overseers).</p></div>

<p>The next of the school that spoke would change
the story somehow, and try to make it more heart-rending
still. We did well at first, making about
5<i>s.</i> a day each, working four hours, two in the
morning and two in the afternoon. We got a
good deal of clothing too. The man who went
without a shirt never went to a door to ask for
one; he had to show himself in the middle of the
road. The man that <i>did</i> go to the door would
say, ‘Do bestow a shirt on my poor shopmate,
who hasn’t had one for some days.’ It’s been
said of me, when I had my shirt tied round my
waist all the time out of sight. The man who
goes without his shirt has his pick of those given;
the rest are sold and shared. Whatever trade we
represented we always had one or two really of
the trade in the school. These were always to be
met at the lodging-houses. They were out of
work, and had to go to low lodging-houses to
sleep. There they met with beggars who kiddied
them on to the lurk. The lodging-houses is good
schools for that sort of thing, and when a mechanic
once gets out on the lurk he never cares to
go to work again. I never knew one return. I
have been out oft and oft with weavers with a
loom, and have woven a piece of ribbon in a gentleman’s
parlour&mdash;that was when we was Coventry
ribbon weavers. I have been a stocking
weaver from Leicester, and a lacemaker too from
Nottingham. Distressed mechanics on their way
to London get initiated into beggar’s tricks in the
low lodging-houses and the unions. This is the
way, you see, sir. A school may be at work
from the lodging-house where the mechanic goes
to, and some of the school finds out what he is,
and says, ‘Come and work with us in a school:
you’ll do better than you can at your business,
and you can answer any questions; we’ll lurk on
your trade.’ I have been out with a woman and
children. It’s been said in the papers that
children can be hired for that lurk at 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i>
a day&mdash;that’s all fudge, all stuff, every bit of it&mdash;there’s
no children to be hired. There’s many
a labouring man out of work, who has a wife and
three or more children, who is glad to let them go
out with any patterer he knows. The woman is
entitled to all the clothes and grub given, and her
share of the tin&mdash;that’s the way it’s done; and
she’s treated to a drink after her day’s work,
into the bargain. I’ve been out on the <i>respectable
family man</i> lurk. I was out with a woman and
three kids the other day; her husband was on the
pad in the country, as London was too hot to
hold him. The kids draws, the younger the better,
for if you vex them, and they’re oldish, they’ll
blow you. Liverpool Joe’s boy did so at Bury St.
Edmund’s to a patterer that he was out with, and
who spoke cross to him. The lad shouted out so
as the people about might hear, ‘Don’t you jaw
me, you’re not my father; my father’s at home
playing cards.’ They had to crack the pitch (discontinue)
through that. The respectable family
dodge did pretty well. I’ve been on <i>the clean
family</i> lurk too, with a woman and children.
We dressed to give the notion that, however
humble, at least we were clean in all our
poverty. On this lurk we stand by the side
of the pavement in silence, the wife in a perticler
clean cap, and a milk-white apron. The
kids have long clean pinafores, white as the
driven snow; they’re only used in clean lurk,
and taken off directly they come home. The
husband and father is in a white flannel jacket,
an apron worn and clean, and polished shoes. To
succeed in this caper there must be no rags, but
plenty of darns. A pack of pawn-tickets is carried
in the waistcoat pocket. (One man that I
know stuck them in his hat like a carman’s.)
That’s to show that they’ve parted with their
little all before they came to that. They are real
pawn-tickets. I have known a man pay 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
for the loan of a marriage certificate to go out
on the clean lurk. If a question is asked, I say&mdash;‘We’ve
parted with everything, and can get
no employment; to be sure, we have had a loaf
from the parish, but what’s that among my
family?’ That takes the start out of the people,
because they say, why not go to the parish? Some
persons say, ‘Oh, poor folks, they’re brought to
this, and how clean they are&mdash;a darn is better
than a patch any time.’ The clean lurk is a bare
living now&mdash;it was good&mdash;lots of togs came in,
and often the whole family were taken into a house
and supplied with flannel enough to make under
clothing for them all; all this was pledged soon
afterwards, and the tickets shown to prove what
was parted with, through want. Those are some
of the leading lurks. There’s others. ‘Fits,’ are
now bad, and ‘paralytics’ are no better. <i>The
lucifer lurk</i> seems getting up though. I don’t
mean the selling, but the dropping them in the
street as if by accident. It’s a great thing with
the children; but no go with the old ’uns. I’ll
tell you of another lurk: a woman I knows sends
out her child with &frac14; oz. of tea and half a quarter
of sugar, and the child sits on a door step crying,
and saying, if questioned, that she was sent
out for tea and sugar, and a boy snatched the
change from her, and threw the tea and sugar in
the gutter. The mother is there, like a stranger,
and says to the child:&mdash;‘And was that your poor
mother’s last shilling, and daren’t you go home,
poor thing?’ Then there is a gathering&mdash;sometimes
18<i>d.</i> in a morning; but it’s almost getting
stale, that is. I’ve done <i>the shivering dodge</i> too&mdash;gone
out in the cold weather half naked. One
man has practised it so much that he can’t get off
shivering now. Shaking Jemmy went on with
his shivering so long that he couldn’t help it at
last. He shivered like a jelly&mdash;like a calf’s foot
with the ague&mdash;on the hottest day in summer.
It’s a good dodge in tidy inclement seasons. It’s
not so good a lurk, by two bob a day, as it once
was. This is a single-handed job; for if one man
shivers less than another he shows that it isn’t
so cold as the good shiverer makes it out&mdash;then
it’s no go. Of the <i>maimed beggars</i>, some are
really deserving objects, as without begging they
must starve to death; that’s a fact, sir. What’s
a labouring man to do if he’s lost any of his limbs?
But some of these even are impostors. I know
several blind men who have pensions; and I
know two who have not only pensions, but keep
lodging-houses, and are worth money, and still go
out a begging&mdash;though not near where they live.
There’s the man with the very big leg, who sits
on the pavement, and tells a long yarn about the
tram carriage having gone over him in the mine.
He does very well&mdash;remarkable well. He goes
tatting and billy-hunting in the country (gathering
rags and buying old metal), and comes only to
London when he has that sort of thing to dispose
of. There’s Paddy in the truck too; he makes a
good thing, and sends money home to Ireland; he
has a decrepit old mother, and it’s to his credit.
He never drinks. There’s Jerry, the collier, he
has lost both arms, and does a tidy living, and
deserves it; it’s a bad misfortune. There’s Jack
Tiptoe, he can’t put one heel to the ground&mdash;no
gammon; but Mr. Horsford and he can’t agree,
so Jack takes to the provinces now. He did very
well indeed here. There used to be a society
among us called <i>the Cadger’s Club</i>; if one got into
a prison there was a gathering for him when he
came out, and 6<i>s.</i> a week for a sick member, and
when he got out again two collections for him, the
two amounting perhaps to 1<i>l.</i> We paid 3<i>d.</i> a
week each&mdash;no women were members&mdash;for thirteen
weeks, and then shared what was in hand, and
began for the next thirteen, receiving new members
and transacting the usual business of a club. This
has been discontinued these five years; the landlord
cut away with the funds. We get up raffles,
and help one another in the best way we can now.
At one time we had forty-five members, besides
the secretary, the conductor, and under-conductor.
The rules were read over on meeting nights&mdash;every
Wednesday evening. They were very strict; no
swearing, obscene or profane language was permitted.
For the first offence a fine of 1<i>d.</i> was
inflicted, for the second 2<i>d.</i>, and for the third the
offender was ejected the room. There was very
good order, and few fines had to be inflicted.
Several respectable tradesmen used to pay a trifle
to be admitted, out of curiosity, to see the proceedings,
and used to be surprised at their regularity.
Among the other rules were these: a fine
of 1<i>d.</i> for any member refusing to sing when called
on; visitors the same. All the fines went to the
fund. If a member didn’t pay for five meeting
nights he was scratched. Very few were scratched.
The secretary was a windmill cove (sold children’s
windmills in the streets), and was excused contributing
to the funds. He had 1<i>d.</i> from each
member every sharing night, once a quarter, for
his labour; he was a very good scholar, and had
been brought up well. The landlord generally
gave a bob on a sharing night. The conductor
managed the room, and the under-conductor kept
the door, not admitting those who had no right to
be there, and putting out those who behaved improperly.
It was held in the Coachmakers’ Arms,
Rose-street, Longrave-street; tip-top swells used
to come among us, and no mistake; real noblemen,
sir. One was the nephew of the Duke
of &mdash;&mdash;, and was well-known to all of us by the
nick-name, Facer.</p>

<p>I used to smoke a very short and very black
pipe, and the honourable gent has often snatched
it from my mouth, and has given me a dozen
cigars for it. My face has been washed in the
gin by a noble lord after he’d made me drunk,
and I felt as if it was vitriol about my eyes.
The beggars are now dispersed and broken up.
They live together now only in twos and threes,
and, in plain truth, have no money to spend; they
can’t get it. Upon an average, in former days a
cadger could make his two or three guineas per
week without working overtime; but now he can
hardly get a meal, not even at the present winter,
though it’s been a slap up inclement season, to be
sure. The Mendicity Society has ruined us&mdash;them
men took me and gave me a month, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
can say from my conscience, that I was no more
guilty of begging at that time than an unborn
baby. The beggars generally live in the low
lodging-houses, and there of a night they tell their
tales of the day, and inform each other of the
good and bad places throughout London, and what
‘lurks’ do the best. They will also say what
beats they intend to take the next day, so that
those who are on the same lurk may not go over
the same ground as their pals. It is no use telling
a lie, but the low lodging-houses throughout
London and the country are nests for beggars and
thieves. I know some houses that are wholly
supported by beggars. In almost every one of the
padding kens, or low lodging-houses in the country,
there is a list of walks written on a piece of paper,
and pasted up over the kitchen mantel-piece. Now
at St. Alban’s, for instance, at the &mdash;&mdash;, and at
other places, there is a paper stuck up in each of
the kitchens. This paper is headed ‘<span class="smcap">Walks out
of this town</span>,’ and underneath it is set down the
names of the villages in the neighbourhood at
which a beggar may call when out on his walk,
and they are so arranged as to allow the cadger to
make a round of about six miles, each day, and
return the same night. In many of those papers
there are sometimes twenty walks set down. No
villages that are in any way ‘gammy’ are ever
mentioned in these papers, and the cadger, if he
feels inclined to stop for a few days in the town,
will be told by the lodging-house keeper, or the
other cadgers that he may meet there, what gentleman’s
seats or private houses are of any account
on the walk that he means to take. The names
of the good houses are not set down in the paper,
for fear of the police. Most of the lodging-house
keepers buy the ‘scran’ (broken victuals) of the
cadgers; the good food they either eat themselves
or sell to the other travellers, and the bad they
sell to parties to feed their dogs or pigs upon.
The cadgers’ talk is quite different now to what
it was in the days of Billy. You see the flats
got awake to it, so in course we had to alter the
patter. The new style of cadgers’ cant is nothing
like the thieves’ cant, and is done all on the
rhyming principle. This way’s the caper. Suppose
I want to ask a pal to come and have a <i>glass</i>
of <i>rum</i> and smoke a <i>pipe</i> of <i>tobacco</i>, and have a
game at <i>cards</i> with some <i>blokes</i> at <i>home</i> with me, I
should say, if there were any flats present,
‘Splodger, will you have a Jack-surp<i>ass</i> of finger-and-<i>thumb</i>,
and blow your yard of <i>tripe</i> of nosey
me <i>knacker</i>, and have a touch of the <i>broads</i> with
me and the other heaps of <i>coke</i> at my <i>drum</i>. [In
this it will be observed that every one of the
‘cant’ words rhymes with the words ordinarily
used to express the same idea.] I can assure you
what little we cadgers do get we earn uncommon
hard. Why, from standing shaking&mdash;that is,
being out nearly naked in the hardest frosts&mdash;I
lost the use of my left side for nearly three years,
and wasn’t able to stir outside the door. I got
my living by card-playing in the low lodging-houses
all that time. I worked the oracle&mdash;they
were not up to it. I put the first and seconds on
and the bridge also. I’d play at cards with any
one. You see, sir, I was afeard to come to you at
first because I had been ‘a starving’ on the pavement
only a few days ago, not a hundred yards
from your very door, and I thought you might
know me.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Meeting of Thieves.</span></h3>

<p>As a further proof, however, of the demoralizing
influences of the low lodging-houses, I will now
conclude my investigations into the subject with a
report of the meeting of vagrants, which I convened
for the express purpose of consulting them
generally upon several points which had come
under my notice in the course of my inquiries.
The Chronicle reporter’s account of this meeting
was as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A meeting of an unprecedented character was
held at the British Union School-room, Shakspeare-walk,
Shadwell, on Monday evening last.
The use of the school-room was kindly granted by
Mr. Fletcher, the proprietor, to whose liberality
we stand indebted for many similar favours. It
was convened by our Metropolitan Correspondent,
for the purpose of assembling together some of the
lowest class of male juvenile thieves and vagabonds
who infest the metropolis and the country
at large; and although privately called, at only
two days’ notice, by the distribution of tickets of
admission among the class in question at the
various haunts and dens of infamy to which they
resort, no fewer than 150 of them attended on the
occasion. The only condition to entitle the parties
to admission was that they should be vagrants,
and under twenty years of age. They had all
assembled some time before the hour for commencing
the proceedings arrived, and never was
witnessed a more distressing spectacle of squalor,
rags, and wretchedness. Some were young men,
and some mere children; one, who styled himself
a “cadger,” was six years of age, and several who
confessed themselves “prigs” were only ten. The
countenances of the boys were of various characters.
Many were not only good-looking, but had
a frank, ingenuous expression that seemed in no
way connected with innate roguery. Many, on
the other hand, had the deep-sunk and half-averted
eye which are so characteristic of natural dishonesty
and cunning. Some had the regular
features of lads born of parents in easy circumstances.
The hair of most of the lads was cut
very close to the head, showing their recent liberation
from prison; indeed, one might tell by the
comparative length of the crop, the time that each
boy had been out of gaol. All but a few of the
elder boys were remarkable, amidst the rags, filth,
and wretchedness of their external appearance,
for the mirth and carelessness impressed upon
their countenances. At first their behaviour was
very noisy and disorderly: coarse and ribald jokes
were freely cracked, exciting general bursts of
laughter; while howls, cat-calls, and all manner
of unearthly and indescribable yells threatened for
some time to render the object of the meeting
utterly abortive. At one moment a lad would
imitate the bray of a jack-ass, and immediately the
whole hundred and fifty would fall to braying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Then some ragged urchin would crow like a cock,
whereupon the place would echo again with a
hundred and fifty cock-crows. Then, as a black
boy entered the room, one of the young vagabonds
would shout out “swe-ee-op.” This would be
received with peals of laughter, and followed by a
general repetition of the same cry. Next, a hundred
and fifty cat-calls of the shrillest possible
description would almost split the ears. These
would be succeeded by cries of “Strike up, you
catgut scrapers,” “Go on with your barrow,”
“Flare up, my never-sweats,” and a variety of
other street sayings. Indeed, the uproar which
went on before the meeting began will be best
understood if we compare it to the scene presented
by a public menagerie at feeding time. The
greatest difficulty, as might be expected, was experienced
in collecting the subjoined statistics of
their character and condition. By a well-contrived
and persevering mode of inquiry, however, the
following facts were <span class="lock">elicited:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>With respect to their <i>ages</i>, the youngest boy
present was 6 years old. He styled himself a
“cadger,” and said that his mother, who is a
widow, and suffering from ill-health, sends him
into the streets to beg. There were seven of 10
years of age, three of 12, three of 13, ten of 14,
ten of 15, eleven of 16, twenty of 17, twenty-six
of 18, and forty-five of 19.</p>

<p>Nineteen had <i>fathers and mothers</i> still living;
thirty-nine had only one parent, and eighty were
orphans in the fullest sense of the word, having
neither father nor mother alive.</p>

<p>Of <i>professed beggars</i> there were fifty, and sixty-six
who acknowledged themselves to be <i>habitual
thieves</i>. The announcement that the greater number
present were thieves pleased them exceedingly,
and was received with three rounds of applause.</p>

<p>Twelve of the youths assembled had been <i>in
prison</i> once (two of these were but 10 years of
age); 5 had been in prison twice; 3, thrice; 4 four
times; 7, five times; 8, six times; 5, seven times;
4, eight times; 2, nine times (1 of them 13 years
of age); 5, ten times; 5, twelve times; 2, thirteen
times; 3, fourteen times; 2, sixteen times;
3, seventeen times; 2, eighteen times; 5, twenty
times; 6, twenty-four times; 1, twenty-five times;
1, twenty-six times; and 1, twenty-nine times.
The announcements in reply to the questions as
to the number of times that any of them had been
in prison were received with great applause, which
became more and more boisterous as the number
of imprisonments increased. When it was announced
that one, though only 19 years of age,
had been in prison as many as twenty-nine times,
the clapping of hands, the cat-calls, and shouts of
“brayvo!” lasted for several minutes, and the
whole of the boys rose to look at the distinguished
individual. Some chalked on their hats the figures
which designated the sum of the several times that
they had been in gaol.</p>

<p>As to the <i>causes of their vagabondism</i>, it was
found that 22 had run away from their homes,
owing to the ill-treatment of their parents; 18
confessed to having been ruined through their
parents allowing them to run wild in the streets,
and to be led astray by bad companions; and 15
acknowledged that they had been first taught
thieving in a lodging-house.</p>

<p>Concerning the vagrant habits of the youths,
the following facts were elicited: 78 regularly
roam through the country every year, 65 sleep
regularly in the casual wards of the unions, and
52 occasionally slept in tramper’s lodging-houses
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Respecting their <i>education</i>, according to the
popular meaning of the term, 63 of the 150 were
able to read and write, and they were principally
thieves. Fifty of this number said they had
read “Jack Sheppard,” and the lives of Dick
Turpin, Claude du Val, and all the other popular
thieves’ novels, as well as the “Newgate Calendar”
and “Lives of the Robbers and Pirates.” Those
who could not read themselves, said they’d had
“Jack Sheppard” read to them at the lodging-houses.
Numbers avowed that they had been
induced to resort to an abandoned course of life
from reading the lives of notorious thieves, and
novels about highway robbers. When asked
what they thought of “Jack Sheppard,” several
bawled out “He’s a regular brick”&mdash;a sentiment
which was almost universally concurred in by the
deafening shouts and plaudits which followed.
When asked whether they would like to be Jack
Sheppards, they answered, “Yes, if the times
was the same now as they were then.” Thirteen
confessed that they had taken to thieving in order
to go to the low theatres; and one lad said he had
lost a good situation on the Birmingham Railway
through his love of the play.</p>

<p>Twenty stated they had <i>been flogged in prison</i>,&mdash;many
of them two, three, and four different
times. A policeman in plain clothes was present;
but their acute eyes were not long before they
detected his real character notwithstanding his
disguise. Several demanded that he should be
turned out. The officer was accordingly given to
understand that the meeting was a private one,
and requested to withdraw. Having apologised
for intruding, he proceeded to leave the room&mdash;and,
no sooner did the boys see the policeman
move towards the door, than they gave vent to
several rounds of very hearty applause, accompanied
with hisses, groans, and cries of “throw
him over.”</p>

<p>The process of interrogating them in the mass
having been concluded, the next step was to call
several of them separately to the platform, to
narrate, in their peculiar style and phraseology,
the history of their own career, together with the
causes which had led them to take up a life of
dishonesty. The novelty of their position as
speech-makers seemed peculiarly exciting to the
speakers themselves, and provoked much merriment
and interest amongst the lads. Their antics
and buffoonery in commencing their addresses
were certainly of the most ludicrous character.
The first speaker, a lad 17 years of age, ascended
the platform, dressed in a torn “wide-a-awake”
hat, and a dirty smock-frock. He began:&mdash;Gentlemen
[immense applause and laughter], I am a
Brummagem lad [laughter]. My father has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
dead three years, and my mother seven. When
my father died I had to go and live along with my
aunt. I fell out of employment, and went round
about the town, and fell into the company of a lot
of chaps, and went picking ladies’ pockets. Then
I was in prison once or twice, and I came to
London, and have been in several prisons here. I
have been in London three years; but I have
been out of it several times in that time. I can’t
get anything honest to do; and I wish I could get
something at sea, or in any foreign land. I don’t
care what or where it is [cheers and yells].</p>

<p>Another lad about 16, clad in a ragged coat,
with a dirty face and matted hair, next came
forward and said&mdash;My father was a soldier, and
when I growed up to about ten years I joined the
regiment as a drummer in the Grenadier Guards.
I went on and got myself into trouble, till at last
I got turned away, and my father left the regiment.
I then went out with some more chaps
and went thieving, and have been thieving about
two years now. [Several voices&mdash;“Very good;”
“that’s beautiful;” “I hope you do it well.”]</p>

<p>The third boy, who stated that he had been
twenty-four times in prison, said he belonged to
Hendon, in Middlesex, and that his father left his
mother seventeen years ago, and he did not know
whether he was dead or alive. He went to Christchurch
school for some time, but afterwards picked
up with bad companions, and went a thieving. He
went to school again, but again left it to go a
thieving and cadging with bad companions. He
had been doing that for the last five years; and if
he could get out of it he would be very glad to
leave it [cheers].</p>

<p>The fourth lad (who was received with loud
cheering, evidently indicating that he was a well-known
character) said, he came from the city of
York, and was a farrier. His father died a few
years ago, and then he took to work; but “the
play” led him on to be a thief, and from that
time to the present he had done nothing but beg
or thieve. If he could go to Australia he would
be very glad; as if he stopped in England he
feared he should do nothing but thieve to the end
[laughter, with cries of “well done,” “very well
spoken”].</p>

<p>The next speaker was about 18 years of age,
and appeared a very sharp intelligent lad. After
making a very grave but irresistibly comical prefatory
bow, by placing his hand at the back of his
head, and so (as it were) forcing it to give a nod,
he proceeded: My father is an engineer’s labourer,
and the first cause of my thieving was that he
kept me without grub, and wallopped me
[laughter]. Well, I was at work at the same
time that he was, and I kept pilfering, and at last
they bowled me out [loud cheers]. I got a showing
up, and at last they turned me away; and, not
liking to go home to my father, I ran away. I
went to Margate, where I had some friends, with
a shilling in my pocket. I never stopped till I
got to Ramsgate, and I had no lodging except
under the trees, and had only the bits of bread I
could pick up. When I got there my grandfather
took me in and kept me for a twelvemonth.
My mother’s brother’s wife had a spite against
me, and tried to get me turned away. I did not
know what thieving was then; and I used to
pray that her heart might be turned, because I
did not know what would become of me if my
grandfather turned me away. But she got other
people to complain of me, and say I was a
nuisance to the town; but I knowed there was
no fault in me; but, however, my grandfather
said he could put up with me no longer, and
turned me away. So after that I came back to
London, and goes to the union. The first night I
went there I got tore up [cheers and laughter].
Everything was torn off my back, and the bread
was taken away from me, and because I said a
word I got well wallopped [renewed laughter].
They “small-ganged” me; and afterwards I went
seven days to prison because others tore my
clothes. When I went in there&mdash;this was the
first time&mdash;a man said to me, “What are you
here for?” I said, “For tearing up.” The man
said to another, “What are you here for?” and
the other made answer, “For a handkerchief.”
The man then said, “Ah, that’s something like;”
and he said to me, “Why are you not a thief&mdash;you
will only get to prison for that.” I said, “I
will.” Well, after that I went pilfering small
things, worth a penny or twopence at first; but I
soon saw better things were as easy to be got as
them, so I took them [laughter]. I picked up
with one that knowed more than me. He fairly
kept me for some time, and I learnt as well as
him. I picked him up in a London workhouse.
After that I thought I would try my friends
again, and I went to my uncle at Dover, but he
could do nothing for me, so I got a place at a
butcher’s, where I fancied myself fairly blessed,
for I had 2<i>s.</i> a week and my board and washing.
I kept a twelvemonth there honest, without
thieving. At last my master and I fell out and I
left again, so I was forced to come up to London,
and there I found my old companions in the
Smithfield pens&mdash;they were not living anywhere.
I used to go to the workhouse and used to tear
up and refuse to work, and used to get sent to
“quod,” and I used to curse the day when it was
my turn to go out. The governor of the prison
used to say he hoped he wouldn’t see my face
there again; but I used to answer, “I shall be
here again to night, because it’s the only place
I’ve got.” That’s all I’ve got to say.</p>

<p>The next lad, who said he had been fourteen
times in prison, was a taller, cleaner, and more
intelligent-looking youth than any that had preceded
him. After making a low affected bow,
over the railing, to the company below, and uttering
a preliminary a-hem or two with the most
ludicrous mock gravity, he began by saying:&mdash;“I
am a native of London. My father is a poor
labouring man, with 15<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;little enough,
I think, to keep a home for four, and find candlelight
[laughter]. I was at work looking after a
boiler at a paper-stainer’s in Old-street-road at 6<i>s.</i>
a week, when one night they bowled me out. I
got the sack, and a bag to take it home in
[laughter]. I got my wages, and ran away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
home, but in four days, being hungry, and having
no money, I went back again. I got a towelling,
but it did not do me much good. My father did
not like to turn me out of doors, so he tied me to
the leg of the bedstead [laughter]. He tied my
hands and feet so that I could hardly move, but I
managed somehow to turn my gob (mouth) round
and gnawed it away. I run down stairs and got
out at the back door and over a neighbour’s wall,
and never went home for nine months. I never
bolted with anything. I never took anything that
was too hot for me. The captain of a man-of-war
about this time took me into his service, where I
remained five weeks till I took a fever, and was
obliged to go to the hospital. When I recovered,
the captain was gone to Africa; and not liking to
go home, I stepped away, and have been from
home ever since. I was in Brummagem, and was
seven days in the new ‘stir’ (prison), and nearly
broke my neck. When I came out, I fell into
bad company, and went cadging, and have been
cadging ever since; but if I could leave off, and
go to the Isle of Dogs, the Isle of Man, or the
Isle of Woman [laughter], or any other foreign
place, I would embrace the opportunity as soon as
I could. And if so be that any gentleman would
take me in hand, and send me out, I would be
very thankful to him, indeed. And so good
night” [cheers].</p>

<p>A dirty little boy, fourteen years of age, dressed
in a big jacket, next stood forward. He said his
father was a man-of-war’s man, and when he came
home from sea once his father, his mother, and all
of them got drunk. The lad then stole 4<i>d.</i> from
his father’s pocket. After this, when he was sent
for sixpenny rum he used to fetch fourpenny, and
for fourpenny gin threepenny; and for fourpenny
beer he used to fetch threepenny, and keep the
difference to himself. His mother used to sell
fruit, and when she left him at the stall he used
to eat what he could not sell, and used to sell
some to get marbles and buttons. Once he stole
a loaf from a baker’s shop. The man let him off,
but his father beat him for it. The beating did
him no good. After that he used to go “smugging”
[running away with] other people’s things.
Then one day his father caught him, and tied his
leg to the bedstead, and left him there till he was
pretty near dead. He ran away afterwards, and
has been thieving ever since.</p>

<p>A lad about twenty was here about to volunteer
a statement concerning the lodging-houses, by
which he declared he had been brought to his
ruin, but he was instantly assailed with cries of
“come down!” “hold your tongue!” and these
became so general, and were in so menacing a
tone, that he said he was afraid to make any disclosures,
because he believed if he did so he would
have perhaps two or three dozen of the other
chaps on to him [great confusion].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayhew</span>: Will it hurt any of you here if
he says anything against the lodging-houses [yes,
yes]? How will it do so?</p>

<p>A Voice: They will not allow stolen property
to come into them if it is told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayhew</span>: But would you not all gladly
quit your present course of life [yes, yes, yes]?
Then why not have the lodging-house system, the
principal cause of all your misery, exposed?</p>

<p>A Voice: If they shut up the lodging-houses,
where are we to go? If a poor boy gets to the
workhouse he catches a fever, and is starved into
the bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayhew</span>:&mdash;Are not you all tired of the
lives you now lead? [Vociferous cries of “yes, yes,
we wish to better ourselves!” from all parts of the
room.] However much you dread the exposure
of the lodging-houses, you know, my lads, as well
as I do, that it is in them you meet your companions,
and ruin, if not begun there, is at least
completed in such places. If a boy runs away
from home he is encouraged there and kept secreted
from his parents. And do not the parties
who keep these places grow rich on your degradation
and your peril? [Loud cries of “yes, yes!”]
Then why don’t you all come forward now, and,
by exposing them to the public, who know nothing
of the iniquities and vice practised in such places,
put an end to these dens at once? There is not
one of you here&mdash;not one, at least, of the elder
boys, who has found out the mistake of his present
life, who would not, I verily believe, become
honest, and earn his living by his industry, if he
could. You might have thought a roving life a
pleasant thing enough at first, but you now know
that a vagabond’s life is full of suffering, care,
peril, and privation; you are not so happy as you
thought you would be, and are tired and disgusted
with your present course. This is what I hear
from you all. Am I not stating the fact? [Renewed
cries of “yes, yes, yes!” and a voice:
“The fact of it is, sir, we don’t see our folly till it
is too late.”] Now I and many hundreds and
thousands really wish you well, and would gladly
do anything we could to get you to earn an honest
living. All, or nearly all, your misery, I know,
proceeds from the low lodging-houses [“yes, yes, it
does, master! it does”]; and I am determined,
with your help, to effect their utter destruction.
[A voice, “I am glad of it, sir&mdash;you are quite
right; and I pray God to assist you.”]</p>

<p>The elder boys were then asked what they
thought would be the best mode of effecting their
deliverance from their present degraded position.
Some thought emigration the best means, for if
they started afresh in a new colony, they said
they would leave behind them their bad characters,
which closed every avenue to employment
against them at home. Others thought there
would be difficulties in obtaining work in the
colonies in sufficient time to prevent their being
driven to support themselves by their old practices.
Many again thought the temptations which surrounded
them in England rendered their reformation
impossible; whilst many more considered that
the same temptations would assail them abroad
which existed at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayhew</span> then addressed them on another
point. He said he had seen many notorious
thieves in the course of his investigations. Since
then he had received them at all hours into his
house&mdash;men of the most desperate and women of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the most abandoned characters&mdash;but he had never
lost a 6<i>d.</i> worth of his property by them. One
thief he had entrusted with a sovereign to get
changed, and the lad returned and gave him back
the full amount in silver. He had since gone out
to America. Now he would ask all those present
whether, if he were to give them a sovereign, they
would do the same? [Several voices here called
out that they would, and others that they would
not. Others, again, said that they would to him,
but to no one else.]</p>

<p>Here one of the most desperate characters present,
a boy who had been twenty-six times in
prison, was singled out from the rest, and a sovereign
given to him to get changed, in order to
make the experiment whether he would have the
honesty to return the change or abscond with it in
his possession. He was informed, on receiving it,
that if he chose to decamp with it, no proceedings
should be taken against him. He left the room
amid the cheers of his companions, and when he
had been absent a few moments all eyes were
turned towards the door each time it opened,
anxiously expecting his arrival, to prove his trustworthiness.
Never was such interest displayed
by any body of individuals. They mounted the
forms in their eagerness to obtain the first glimpse
of his return. It was clear that their honour was
at stake; and several said they would kill the lad
in the morning if he made off with the money.
Many minutes elapsed in almost painful suspense,
and some of his companions began to fear that so
large a sum of money had proved too great a
temptation for the boy. At last, however, a
tremendous burst of cheering announced the lad’s
return. The delight of his companions broke forth
again and again, in long and loud peals of applause,
and the youth advanced amidst triumphant
shouts to the platform, and gave up the money in
full.</p>

<p>The assemblage was then interrogated as to
the effect of flogging as a punishment; and the
general feeling appeared to be that it hardened
the criminal instead of checking his depravity,
and excited the deadliest enmity in his bosom at
the time towards the person inflicting it. When
asked whether they had seen any public executions,
they almost all cried out that they had seen
Manning and his wife hung; others said that they
had seen Rush and Sarah Thomas executed. They
stated that they liked to go a “death-hunting,”
after seeing one or two executed. It hardened
them to it, and at last they all got to thieve under
the gallows. They felt rather shocked at the
sight of an execution at first; but, after a few
repetitions, it soon wore off.</p>

<p>Before the meeting broke up several other lads
expressed a strong desire to make statements.</p>

<p>A young man, 18 years of age, and of a
miserable and ragged appearance, said he first left
home from bad usage; and could not say whether
it was the same with his sister or not, but she left
her home about nine months ago, when he met
her while he was getting his living as a costermonger.
With the stock-money that he had, rather
than she should be driven to prostitution and the
streets, he bought as many things as he could to
furnish a room. This exhausted his stock-money,
and then his furniture had to go a little at a time
to support him and his sister in food. After this
he was obliged to take a furnished room, which
put him to greater expense. To keep her off the
streets, he was compelled to thieve. His father,
if he ever had the feeling of a Christian, would
never have treated him as he had done. Could a
father (he asked) have any feeling, who chained
his son up by the leg in a shed, as <i>his</i> father had
done to him, and fed him on bread and water for
one entire month: and then, after chaining him
up all day, still chain him in bed at night. This
it was that drove him into the streets at first. It
was after his mother died, and he had a step-mother,
that his father treated him thus. His
mother-in-law ill-treated him as well as his father.
If he had been a transport he could not have been
treated worse. He told his father that he was
driving him on the road to transportation, but
he took no notice of it; and he was obliged to
leave his roof. He had been in Newgate since.</p>

<p>A little boy, dressed in the garb of a sailor,
came up to Mr. Mayhew crying bitterly, and implored
him to allow him to say a word. He stated&mdash;I
am here starving all my time. Last night I
was out in the cold and nearly froze to death.
When I got up I was quite stiff and could hardly
walk. I slept in Whitechapel under a form where
they sell meat. I was an apprentice on board of
a fishing smack, and ran away because I was ill-treated.
After I ran away I broke into my
master’s house because I was hungry. He gave
me twelve months, and now he is in the union
himself; he failed in business and got broken up.
I have been out of prison three months, starving;
and I would rather do anything than thieve. If
I see a little thing I take it, because I can’t get
anything to eat without it. [Here the child, still
weeping piteously, uncovered his breast, and
showed his bones starting through his skin. He
said he was anxious to get out of the country.]</p>

<p>The following statement respecting the lodging-houses
was made, after the others had left, by
another lad. He left home when about thirteen,
and never thieved before that. His father was
dead, and his mother was unable to keep him. He
got a situation and held it for three years and
nine months, until he picked up with a man from
a lodging-house, and through keeping late hours
he was obliged to leave his place and sleep in a
lodging-house himself. The lodging-house is in
Short’s-gardens. This he considered to have been
the commencement of his downfall. About forty
thieves lived in the house, and they brought in
stolen property of every description, and the deputies
received it and took it to other people to sell
it again, and get the price and pay the thieves.
They got double as much as the thieves did, or
else they would have nothing to do with it.
Several housebreakers lived at the house, and he
heard them there plan the robbery of Bull and
Wilson, the woollen-drapers in St. Martin’s-lane.
One of the men secreted himself in the house in
the daytime, and the other two were admitted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
him at night. If he had stated this at the meeting
the persons present would have killed him. He
was sure that more might be done by giving proper
encouragement to virtue, and by reforming the
criminal, than by rigorous prosecution. He said
(with tears in his eyes) that he should be very
willing and happy to work for an honest living if
he could only get it to do. He showed a letter of
recommendation for good conduct to his former
master, and a Bible; both of which had been
given him by the chaplain of the gaol which he
had just left, after undergoing an imprisonment of
twelve months. It was useless (he said) for a
young man like him to apply to the parish for relief;
he might just as well stand in the street and
talk to a lamp-post. Then what was a man to do
after he left prison? He must go a thieving to
live. He was persuaded that if there was an institution
to give employment to the homeless, the
friendless, and the penniless, after being liberated
from prison, it would be the means of rescuing
thousands.</p>

<p>The proceedings then terminated. The assemblage,
which had become more rational and manageable
towards the close, dispersed, quite peaceably
it should be added, and the boys were
evidently sincerely grateful for the efforts being
made to bring their misfortunes before the notice
of those in whose power it may be to alleviate
them.</p>

<p>Before they were dismissed, as much money
was dispensed to each as would defray his night’s
lodging.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Country Lodging-Houses.</span></h3>

<p>Concerning the lodging-houses, more especially
in the country, I give the statement of a middle-aged
man, familiar with them for twenty years.
He was recommended to me as possessed of much
humour and a great master of humourous <span class="lock">slang:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I can tell you all about it, sir; but one lodging-house
is so like another that I can’t draw much
distinction. In small country towns, especially
agricultural towns, they are decent places enough,
regular in their hours, and tidy enough. At these
places they have what they call ‘their own travellers,’
persons that they know, and who are always
accommodated in preference. As to the characters
that frequent these places, let us begin with <i>the
Crocusses</i>. They carry about a lot of worms in
bottles, what they never took out of anybody,
though they’ll tell you different, or long pieces of
tape in bottles, made to look like worms, and on
that they’ll <i>patter</i> in a market place as if on a real
cure, and they’ve got the cheek to tell the people
that that very worm was taken from Lady &mdash;&mdash;,
near the town, and referring them to her to prove
it. The one I knew best would commence with a
piece of sponge in a bottle, which he styled the
stomach wolf. That was his leading slum, and
pretty well he sponged them too. When he’d pattered
on about the wolf, he had another bottle with
what he called a worm 200 inches long, he bounced
it was, which the day before yesterday he had
from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;’s girl (some well-known person),
and referred them to her. While he’s going on, a
brother Crocus will step up, a stranger to the people,
and say, ‘Ah, Doctor &mdash;&mdash;, you’re right. I had
the pleasure of dining with Mr. &mdash;&mdash; when the
worm was extracted, and never saw a child so
altered in my life.’ That’s what the Crocus’s call
giving a jolly; and after that don’t the first
Crocus’s old woman serve out the six-pennyworths?
The stuff is to cure every mortal thing
a man can ail&mdash;ay, or a woman either. They’d
actually have the cheek to put a blister on a
cork leg. Well, when they’re done pattering on
the worm racket, then come the wonderful pills.
Them are the things. These pills, from eight to a
dozen in a box, are charged 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> according to
the flat’s appearance&mdash;as the Crocus call his customers.
The pills meet with a ready sale, and
they’re like chip in porridge, neither good nor harm.
It’s chiefly the bounciful patter, the cheek they
have, that gets them Crocusses on. It’s amazing.
They’ll stare a fellow in the face, and make him
believe he’s ill whether he is or no. The man I
speak of is a first-rate cove; he trains it and
coaches it from market to market like any gentleman.
He wears a stunning fawny (ring) on his
finger, an out-and-out watch and guard, and not a
duffer neither&mdash;no gammon; and a slap-up suit of
black togs. I’ve seen the swell bosmen (farmers)
buy the pills to give the people standing about, just
to hear the Crocus patter. Why they’ve got the
cheek to pitch their stall with their worms opposite
a regular medical man’s shop, and say, ‘Go over
the way and see what he’ll do&mdash;he’ll drive up in
a horse and gig to your door, and make you pay
for it too; but I don’t&mdash;I’ve walked here to do
you good, and I <i>will</i> do you good before I leave
you. One trial is all I ask’&mdash;and quite enough
too (said my informant). I’ll warrant they won’t
come a second time; if they do, it’s with a stick
in their hands. If he does much business in the
worm-powder way (some have it in cakes for children),
the Crocus never gives them a chance to
catch him. But if it’s only pills, he’ll show next
market day, or a month after, and won’t he crack
about it then? He says, ‘One trial is all I ask,’
and one of them got it and was transported. I
knew one of these Crocusses who was once so hard
up from lushing and boozing about that he went
into a field and collected sheep dung and floured
it over, and made his pills of it, and made the
people swallow it at Lutterworth market, in Leicestershire;
because there they’ll swallow anything.
If the Crocus I have mentioned see this
in the paper&mdash;as he will, for he’s a reading-man&mdash;won’t
he come out bouncefull? He’ll say, ‘Why
am I thus attacked&mdash;why don’t the proprietor and
the editor of this paper come forward&mdash;if he’s
among you? Who made this report? let him
come forward, and I’ll refute him face to face.’
And no doubt (my informant remarked), he’d give
him a tidy dose, too, the Crocus would. For myself,
I’d far rather meet him face to face than his
medicine, either his blue or his pink water.
There’s another sort who carry on the crocussing
business, but on a small scale; they’re on the
penny and twopenny racket, and are called hedge
crocusses&mdash;men who sell corn salve, or ‘four pills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
a penny,’ to cure anything, and go from house to
house in the country. But as the hedge crocus is
shickery togged, he makes poorly out. Respectable
people won’t listen to him, and it’s generally the
lower order that he gulls. These hedge fellows
are slow and dull; they go mouching along as if
they were croaking themselves. I’ve seen the
head crocus I’ve mentioned at four markets in
one week, and a town on a Saturday night, clear
from 5<i>l.</i> to 7<i>l.</i>&mdash;all clear profit, for his fakement
costs him little or nothing. For such a man’s
pound, the hedge fellow may make 1<i>s.</i> The next
I’ll tell you about is durynacking, or duryking.
The gipsies (and they’re called Romanies) are
the leading mob at this racket, but they’re well
known, and I needn’t say anything about
those ladies. But there’re plenty of travelling
women who go about with a basket
and a bit of driss (lace) in it, gammy lace, for a
stall-off (a blind), in case they meet the master,
who would order them off. Up at a bosken
(farm-house) they’ll get among the servant girls,
being pretty well acquainted with the neighbourhood
by inquiries on the road, as to the number
of daughters and female servants. The first inquiry
is for the missus or a daughter, and if they
can’t be got at they’re on to the slaveys. Suppose
they do get hold of one of the daughters,
they commence by offering the driss, which, as it
is queer stuff, wouldn’t be picked up by an agricultural
young lady, as the durynacker very well
knows. Then she begins, ‘Ah! my sweet young
lady, my blessed looking angel’&mdash;if she’s as ugly
as sin, and forty; they say that, and that’s the
time you get them to rights, when they’re old
and ugly, just by sweetening them, and then they
don’t mind tipping the loaver (money)&mdash;‘I know
you dont want this stuff (she’ll continue), there’s
something on your mind. I see you’re in love;
but the dear handsome gentleman&mdash;he’ll not
slight you, but loves you as hard as a hammer.’
This is thrown out as a feeler, and the young
lady is sure to be confused; then the durrynacker
has hold of her mauly (hand) in a minute. It’s
all up with the girl, once the woman gets a grip.
She’s asked in directly, and of course the sisters
(if she has any) and the slavey are let into the
secret, and all have their fortunes told. The fortune-teller
may make a week’s job of it, according
as the loaver comes out. She’ll come away with
her basket full of eggs, bacon, butter, tea and
sugar, and all sorts of things. I <i>have</i> seen them
bring the scran in! Every one is sure to have
handsome husbands, thumping luck, and pretty
children. The durrynacker, too, is not particular,
if there’s a couple of silver spoons&mdash;she doesn’t
like odd ones; and mind you, she alway carries a
basket&mdash;big enough too. I know a man on this
lurk, but he works the article with a small glass
globe filled full of water, and in that he shows
girls their future husbands, and kids them on to
believe they do see them&mdash;ay, and the church
they’re to be married in&mdash;and they fancy they do
see it as they twist the globe this way and that,
while he twists the tin out of them, and no flies.
He actually had the cheek, though he knew
I was fly to every fake, to try to make me
believe that I could see the place where Smith
O’Brien had the fight in Ireland! ‘Don’t you
see them cabbages, and a tall man in a green
velvet cap among them, holloring out, “I’m the
King of Munster?”’ I don’t know any other male
durrynacker worth noticing; the women have
all the call. Young women won’t ask their fortunes
of men. The way the globe man does is to
go among the old women and fiddle (humbug)
them, and, upon my word, three-parts of them are
worse than the young ones. Now I’ll tell you
about the tat (rag) gatherers; buying rags they
call it, but I call it bouncing people. Two men I
lodged with once, one morning hadn’t a farthing,
regularly smashed up, not a feather to fly with,
they’d knocked down all their tin lushing. Well,
they didn’t know what to be up to, till one hit
upon a scheme. ‘I’ve got it, Joe,’ says he. He
borrows two blue plates from the lodging-house
keeper, a washing jug and basin. Off they goes,
one with the crockery, and the other with a bag.
They goes into the by-courts in Windsor, because
this bouncing caper wouldn’t do in the main
drag. Up goes the fellow with a bag, and hollas
out, ‘Now, women, bring out your copper, brass,
white rags, old flannel, bed-sacking, old ropes,
empty bottles, umbrellas&mdash;any mortal thing&mdash;the
best price is given;’ and the word’s hardly out,
when up comes his pal, hollaring, ‘Sam, holloa!
stop that horse,’ as if he’d a horse and cart passing
the court, and then the women bring out their
umbrellas and things, and they’re all to be exchanged
for crockery such as he shows, and all
goes into the bag, and the bagman goes off with
the things, leaving the other to do the bounce,
and he keeps singing out for the horse and cart
with the load of crockery, gammoning there is
one, that the ladies may have their choice, and he
then hurries down to quicken his cart-driver’s
movements, and hooks it, leaving the flats completely
stunned. Oh! it does give them a ferry-cadouzer.
Two other men go about on this lurk,
one with an old cracked plate under his waistcoat,
and the other with a bag. And one sings out,
‘Now, women, fourpence a pound for your white
rags. None of your truck system, your needles
and thread for it. I don’t do it that way;
ready money, women, is the order of the day
with me.’ Well, one old mollesher (woman),
though she must have known her rags would only
bring 2<i>d.</i> a lb. at a fair dealer’s, if there be one,
brought out 8 lbs. of white rags. He weighs
them with his steelyards, and in they went to the
bag. The man with the bag steps it immediately,
and the other whips out his flute quite carelessly,
and says&mdash;‘Which will you have marm, Jem Crow,
or the Bunch of Roses?’ The old woman says
directly, ‘What do you mean, 8 times 4 is 32,
and 32 pence is 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; never mind, I won’t be
hard, give me half-a-crown.’ Well, when she
finds there’s no money, out she hollars, and he
plays his distracted flute to drown her voice, and
backs himself manfully out of the court. I have
known these men get on so that I have seen them
with a good horse and cart. There’s another class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of rag bloaks, who have bills printed with the
Queen’s Arms at the top, if you please, ‘By royal
authority’&mdash;that’s their own authority, and they
assume plenty of it. Well, this bill specifies the best
prices for rags, left-off clothes, &amp;c. One fellow goes
and drops these bills at the kens (houses), the other
comes after him, and as the man who drops marks
every house where a bill has been taken, the
second man knows where to call. Any house
where he gets a call commences the caper. Well,
anything to be disposed of is brought out, often in
the back yard. The party of the house produces
the bill, which promises a stunning tip for the old
lumber. The man keeps sorting the things out,
and running them down as not so good as he expected;
but at the same time he kids them on by
promising three times more than the things are
worth. This is a grand racket&mdash;the way he
fakes them, and then he says, ‘Marm (or sir, as it
may be), I shall give you 15<i>s.</i> for the lot,’ which
stuns the party, for they never expected to get
anything like that&mdash;and their expectations is not
disappointed, for they don’t. Then he turns round
directly, and commences sorting more particularly
than before, putting the best and the easiest to
carry altogether. He starts up then, and whips a
couple of bob, or half a bull (2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) into the
woman’s hand, saying, ‘I always like to bind a
bargain, marm&mdash;one of the fairest dealing men
travelling. Do save all your old lumber for me.’
Of a sudden he begins searching his pockets, and
exclaims, ‘Dear me, I haven’t enough change in
my pocket, but I’ll soon settle that&mdash;my mate has
it outside. I’ll just take a load out to the cart,
and come back for the others with the money;’
and so he hooks it, and I’ve no occasion to tell
you he never comes back; and that’s what he calls
having them on the knock.”</p>

<p>The other inmates at the lodging-houses which
my informant described are of the class concerning
whom full information is or will be given in other
portions of this or the following letters. His description
of the lodging-houses, too, was a corroboration
of the statement I give to-day. All the
classes described meet and mix at the lodging-houses.</p>

<p>I shall reserve what I have to say concerning
the influence of the low lodging-houses of London
and the country till the conclusion of the
present volume.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Chemical Articles
of Manufacture.</span></h3>

<p>The street purveyors of blacking, of the different
preparations of black lead, of plating-balls, of corn-salves,
of grease-removing compositions, of china
and glass cements, of rat poisons, of fly-papers, of
beetle-wafers, of gutta-percha heads, of lucifer-matches,
and of cigar-lights, may be classed
generally under two heads. They are either very
old or very young persons, or else they are men
who recommend their wares by patter.</p>

<p>Among the first-mentioned class are the vendors
of cakes of blacking, papers of black-lead, and
lucifer matches. Of blacking and black-lead the
street-sellers are more frequently old women; of
lucifer matches they are usually women and
children, and of all ages. It is not uncommon,
in the quieter roads of the suburbs especially, to
see a young woman extend her bare red arm from
beneath a scanty ragged shawl, and with an imploring
look, a low curtsey, and a piteous tone,
proffer a box of matches for sale; while a child in
her arms, perhaps of two or three years old, extends
in its little hand another box. There are
also in the street sale of lucifer matches very
many girls and boys, parentless or uncared for,
and many old or infirm women and men.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of chemically-manufactured
articles, who feel it necessary to recommend their
wares by a little street oratory, or patter, (the
paper-worker, whose humorous remarks I have
before quoted, once described it to me as “advertising
by word of mouth,”) are the vendors of
the articles which are to cure, to repair, to renovate,
or to kill. Any other itinerant vendors of
chemical articles are of the ordinary class of street
traders.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Blacking, Black
Lead, etc.</span></h3>

<p>I specify these two commodities jointly, because
they are frequently sold by the same individual.
In Whitechapel and Spitalfields are eight establishments,
where the street-sellers of blacking are
principally supplied with their stock. It is sold
in cakes, which are wrapped in a kind of oil
paper, generally printed on the back, so as to catch
the eye, with the address of some well-known
blacking manufacturer. Thus some which a street-seller
of blacking showed me were printed, in
large type, as a sort of border, “Lewis’s India
Rubber Blacking,” while in the middle was a very
black and very predominant 30, and beneath it,
in small and hardly distinguishable type, “Princess-st.,
Portman-market.” Any shopkeeper, who
“supplies the trade,” if he be a regular customer
of the manufacturer, can have his name and
address printed on the cover of the blacking-cakes.
The 30 is meant to catch the eye with the well-known
flourish of “30, Strand.”</p>

<p>The quality of these cakes of blacking, the
street-sellers whom I questioned told me was
highly approved by their customers, and, as blacking
is purchased by the classes who aim at a
smartness and cleanliness above that of the purchasers
of many street commodities, there is no
reason to doubt the assertion. The sale of this
blacking, indeed, is chiefly on a round, and it
would be hopeless as to future custom to call a
second time at any house where bad blacking had
been sold on a previous visit. The article is
vended wholesale, in “gross boxes,” and “half-gross
boxes.” The half-gross boxes are 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>,
and capital, even in this trifling trade, has its
customary advantages, for the “gross boxes” are
but 3<i>s.</i> It should be remembered, however, that
to the buyer of two “half-gross” a couple of the
plain wooden boxes, in which the blacking is sold,
and often hawked, must be supplied; but to
the buyer of a “gross box” only one of these
cases is furnished. I may mention, to the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
of the vendors, that of the wholesale blacking
makers, two have themselves been street-sellers,
and one still, but only at intervals, goes “on a
blacking-round” among his old customers. There
are other blacking-makers, but those I have specified,
as to number, are more particularly the providers
for the street trade. The poor people who
sell blacking at a distance from the manufacturer’s
premises&mdash;as in the case of the “30, Princess-st.,
Portman-market”&mdash;are supplied by oilmen, chandlers,
and other shopkeepers, who buy largely of
the manufacturers, and can consequently supply
the purchasers by the dozen, for street sale or
hawking, as cheaply as they would be supplied by
the manufacturer himself. A dozen is generally
charged 3&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and as the cakes are sold at &frac12;<i>d.</i>
each (occasionally 1<i>d.</i>, both by the street people
and more frequently the small shopkeepers) the
profit is moderate enough. The cakes, however,
which are regularly retailed at 1<i>d.</i>, are larger, and
cost nearly twice the amount of the others wholesale.</p>

<p>This trade presents the peculiarity of being
almost entirely a street “door-to-door” trade, as
I heard it described. Blacking is not presented
for purposes of begging, as are lucifer-matches,
tracts, memorandum-books, boot-laces, &amp;c.; for
the half-trading, half-begging, is carried on in the
quieter parts of town, and more extensively in the
suburbs, ladies being principally accosted, and to
them blacking is not offered.</p>

<p>There are now, I learn from good authority,
never fewer than 200 persons selling cake blacking,
“from door to door.” More than half of
them are elderly women, and more than three-fourths
women of all ages and girls. The other
sellers are old men and boys. None of the blacking-sellers
make the article they vend. To sell
eight dozen cakes a week is a full average, and of
these the “pennies” and the “half-pennies” are
about equally divided. This gives a weekly outlay
of 6<i>s.</i> to each individual seller, with an average
profit of about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and shows a yearly street-expenditure
by the public of 3120<i>l.</i> The profit,
however, is not in equal apportionment among
the traders in blacking, for the “old hands” on
a regular round will do double the business of the
others.</p>

<p>In liquid blacking the trade is now small. It
is occasionally sold in the street markets on
Saturday nights, but the principal traffic is in the
public-houses. This kind of blacking is retailed at
2<i>d.</i> a bottle, and, I was informed by a man who
had sold it, was “rather queer stuff.” It is labelled
“equal to” (in very small letters) “<span class="smcap">Day and
Martin</span>” in very large letters. One of the manufacturers
a few years ago told my informant that
he had been threatened “with being sued for
piracy, but it was no use sueing a mouse.” There
are sometimes none, and sometimes twenty persons
hawking this blacking, and they are principally,
I am informed, the servants of showmen,
“out of employ,” or “down on their luck.”
Some of these men “raffle” their blacking in
public-houses. They are provided with tickets,
numbered from one to six, which are thrown, the
blank sides upwards on a table, and the drawer
of number six wins a two-penny bottle of blacking
for &frac12;<i>d.</i>; for this the raffler receives 3<i>d.</i> Few of
these traders sell more than one dozen bottles in a
day, the principal trade being in the evening, and
“one-and-a-half dozen is a very good day.” The
goods are carried in a sack, slung from the shoulder,
and are a very heavy carriage, as two-and-a-half
dozen, which are often carried, weigh about
100 lbs. If ten men, the year through, take each
6<i>s.</i> weekly (about half the amount being profit),
which, I am assured, is the average extent of the
trade, we find 156<i>l.</i> yearly expended in this
liquid blacking. “Ten years ago,” said one
blacking seller to me, “it was three times as
much as it is now.” At the mews blacking is
sold by men who are for the most part servants
out of place, or who have become known
to the denizens of the mews, from having been
“helpers” in some capacity, if they have not
worn a livery. Here the article vended is what
it is announced to be,&mdash;“Hoby’s” or “Everett’s”
blacking. The sellers are known to the coachmen
and grooms, many of whom have to “find
their own blacking,” or there would be no business
done in the mews, the dwellers there being
great sticklers for “a good article.” The profit
to the vendors is 3<i>s.</i> in 12<i>s.</i> Shilling bottles are
vended as numerously as “sixpennies.” An old
coachman, who had lived in mews in all parts of
town, calculated that, take the year through, there
was every day twenty men selling blacking in
the mews, with an average profit of 10<i>d.</i> a day,
or 5s. a week, so taking 15<i>s.</i> each. This gives a
mews expenditure, yearly, of 780<i>l.</i></p>

<p><i>Black-Lead</i>, for the polishing of grates, is sold
in small paper packets, the half ounce being a
&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and the ounce a 1<i>d.</i> The profit is cent. per
cent. Nearly all the women who sell blacking, as
I have described, sell black-lead also. In addition
to these elderly traders, however, there are from
twenty to thirty boys and girls who vend black-lead
in the street markets, but chiefly on Saturday
nights, and on other days offer it through the area
rails&mdash;their wretched plight, without any actual
begging, occasionally procuring them custom.</p>

<p>The black-lead sold in the streets has often a
label in imitation of that of established shop-keepers,
as “Superfine Pencil Black-Lead, prepared
expressly for, and sold by T. H. Jennings, Oil-Colour
and Italian Warehouse, 25, Wormwood-street,
City.” The name and address must of
course be different, but the arrangement of the
lines, and often the type, is followed closely,
as are the adornments of the packet, which
in the instance cited are heraldic. In other parts of
town, the labels of tradesmen are imitated in a
similar way, but not very closely; and in nearly
half the quantity sold a <i>bonâ fide</i> label is given,
without imitation or sham. “There would be
more sold in that way,” I was told by a sharp
lad, “quite the real ticket, if the dons as wholesales
the black-lead, would make it up to sell in
ha’porths and penn’orths, with a proper ’lowance
to us as sells.” This boy and a young sister went
on a round; the boy with black-lead, the girl with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
boot-laces, in one direction, the mother going in
another, and each making for their room at six in
the evening, or as soon as “sold out.”</p>

<p>There are, I am informed, 100 to 150 persons
selling and hawking black-lead in the streets, and
it may be estimated that they take 4<i>s.</i> each
weekly (the adults selling other small articles
with the black-lead); thus we find, averaging the
number of sellers at 125, that 1,300<i>l.</i> is yearly
expended in this article, half of which sum forms
the profit of the street-folk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of French Polish.</span></h3>

<p>The greater part of the French polish vended in
the streets is bought at oil and varnish-shops in
Bethnal-green and Whitechapel, the wholesale
price being 1<i>s.</i> a pint. The street-vendors add
turpentine to the polish, put it into small bottles,
and retail it at 1<i>d.</i> a bottle. They thus contrive
to clear 5<i>d.</i> on each shilling they take.</p>

<p>There are now five and sometimes six men
selling French polish in the streets and public-houses.
“But the trade’s getting stale,” I was
told; “there was twice as many in it three or
four years back, and there’ll be fewer still next
year.” When French polish first became famous
there were, I was informed, several cabinet-makers
who hawked it&mdash;some having prepared it themselves&mdash;and
they would occasionally clear 5<i>s.</i> in a
day. Of these street-traders there are now none,
the present vendors having been in no way connected
with the manufacture of furniture. These
men generally carry with them pieces of “fancy
wood,” such as rose, or sandal wood, which they
polish up in the streets to show the excellence of
the varnish. The chief purchasers are working
people and small tradespeople, or their wives, who
require trifling quantities of such a composition
when they re-polish any small article of furniture.</p>

<p>The French polish-sellers, I am assured by a
man familiar with the business, take 2<i>s.</i> a day
each, or rather in an evening, for the sales are
then the most frequent: the 2<i>s.</i> leaves a profit of
10<i>d.</i> The street expenditure is, therefore (reckoning
five regular sellers), 156<i>l.</i> yearly. None of
the French polish-sellers confine themselves entirely
to the sale of it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Grease-removing
Compositions.</span></h3>

<p>The persons engaged in this trade carry it on
with a regular patter. One man’s street announcement
is in the following words: “Here you have
a composition to remove stains from silks, muslins,
bombazeens, cords, or tabarets of any kind or
colour. It will never injure nor fade the finest
silk or satin, but restore it to its original colour.
For grease on silks, &amp;c., only rub the composition
on dry, let it remain five minutes, then take a
clothes’ brush and brush it off, and it will be found
to have removed the stains. For grease in woollen
cloths spread the composition on the place with a
piece of woollen cloth and cold water; when dry
rub it off, and it will remove the grease or stain.
For pitch or tar use hot water instead of cold, as
that prevents the nap coming off the cloth. Here
it is. Squares of grease-removing composition,
never known to fail, only 1<i>d.</i> each.”</p>

<p>This street-traffic, I was informed, was far more
extensively carried on when silks and woollen
cloths, and textile manufactures generally, were
more costly and more durable than at present,
and when to dye, and scour, and “turn” a garment,
was accounted good housewiveship. The
sellers then told wonders of their making old silk
gowns, or old coats, as good as new, by removing
every discolouration, no matter from what cause.
Now a silk dress is rarely, if ever, subjected to
the experiment of being renovated by the virtues
of grease-removing compositions sold in the streets.
The trade, at present, is almost confined to the
removing of the grease from coat-collars, or of
stains from contact with paint, &amp;c., with which
boys (principally) have damaged their garments.</p>

<p>The grease-remover generally carries his wares
on a tray slung in front of him, and often illustrates
the efficacy of his composition, by showing
its application to the very greasy collar of a boy’s
old jacket, which is removed with admirable facility.
The man patters as he carries on this
work. “You would have thought now that
jacket was done for, and only fit for the rag-bag,
or to go to make up a lot for a Jew; but with my
composition&mdash;only 1<i>d.</i> a cake&mdash;it has acquired a
new nap and a new gloss, and you’ve escaped a
tailor’s bill for awhile for 1<i>d.</i> You can use your
own eyes. You’ve seen me do it, and here’s the
very same stuff as I have proved to you is so
useful and was never known to fail. No mother,
or wife, or mistress, or maid, that wishes to be
careful and not waste money, should be without
it in the house. It removes stains from silks,
&amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these many recommendations,
the street trade in grease-removing cakes is a very
poor one. It cannot be carried on in bad weather,
for an audience cannot then be collected, and to
clear 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in a day is accounted fair work. No
grease-remover confines his trade to that commodity.
One of the best known sells also plate balls,
and occasionally works conundrums and comic
exhibitions. The two brothers, who were formerly
Grecians at the Blue Coat School, are also in this
line. There are now seven men who sell grease-removing
compositions, which they prepare themselves.
The usual ingredients are pipe clay, two
pennyworth of which is beat up and “worked
with two colours,” generally red lead and stone
blue. This gives the composition a streaky look,
and takes away the appearance of pipe clay.</p>

<p>The purchasers of this article are, I am told,
women and servants, but the trade is one which
is declining. One of the best localities for sale is
Ratcliff Highway and the purchasers there are
sailors. One man told me that he once made a
pound’s worth for a sailor, who took it to sea with
him. The street-seller did not know for what
purpose, but he conjectured that it was as a matter
of speculation to a foreign country.</p>

<p>Calculating that the seven grease-removers carry
on the sale of the article 3 days each week, and
clear 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day, we find 78 guineas yearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
expended in the streets for the removal of grease.
Nearly the whole is profit.</p>

<p><i>Plating Balls</i> are generally sold by the grease-removers,
but sometimes they are proffered for
sale alone. There are four men whose principal
dependance is on the sale of plating
balls. One announces his wares as “making
plate as good as silver, and all inferior metals
equal to the best plated. No tarnish can stand
against my plate balls,” he goes on, “and if, in
this respectable company, there should chance to
be any lady or genl’man that has no plate, then
let him make an old brass candlestick shine like
gold, or his tin candlestick, extinguisher and all,
shine like silver. Here are the balls that can do
it, and only 4 a penny. You have only to rub
the ball on your wash-leather, or dry woollen
cloth, and rub it on what has to be restored.
Four a penny!”</p>

<p>These balls, which are prepared by the street-sellers,
are usually made of a halfpennyworth of
whitening, a farthing’sworth of red-lead, and an
ounce of quicksilver, costing 7<i>d.</i> A gross of balls
costs 7&frac34;<i>d.</i>, as regards the materials. The receipts
of the plating ball sellers are the same as those of
the grease-removers, but with a somewhat smaller
profit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Corn-Salve.</span></h3>

<p>The street purveyors of corn-salve, or corn-plaster,
for I heard both words used, are not more than
a dozen in number; but, perhaps, none depend
<i>entirely</i> upon the sale of corn-salve for a living.
As is the wont of the pattering class to which
they belong, these men make rounds into the
country and into the suburbs, but there are sometimes,
on one day, a dozen “working the main
drags” (chief thoroughfares) of London: there
are no women in the trade. The salve is most
frequently carried on a small tray, slung in front
of the street professional; but sometimes it is sold
at a small stall or stand. Oxford-street, Holborn,
Tottenham-court-road, and Whitechapel, are favourite
localities for these traders; as are Blackfriars-road
and Newington-causeway on the Surrey
side of the Thames. On the Saturday evening
the corn-salve sellers resort to the street markets.</p>

<p>The patter of these traders is always to the
same purport (however differently expressed)&mdash;the
long-tested efficacy and the unquestionable cheapness
of their remedies. The vendors are glib and
unhesitating; but some, owing, I imagine, to a
repetition of the same words, as they move from
one part of a thoroughfare to another, or occupy a
pitch, have acquired a monotonous tone, little calculated
to impress a street audience&mdash;to effect
which a man must be, or appear to be, in earnest.
The patter of one of these dealers, who sells corn-salve
on fine evenings, and works the public-houses,
“with anything likely,” on wet evenings,
is, from his own account, in the following <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Here you have a speedy remedy for every
sort of corn! Your hard corn, soft corn, blood
corn, black corn, old corn, new corn, wart, or
bunion, can be safely cured in three days! Nothing
further to do but spread this salve on a piece of
glove-leather, or wash-leather, and apply it to the
place. Art and nature does the rest. Either
corns, warts, or bunions, cured for one penny.”</p>

<p>This, however, is but as the announcement of
the article on sale, and is followed by a recapitulation
of the many virtues of that peculiar recipe;
but, as regards the major part of these street-traders,
the recapitulation is little more than a
change of words, if that. There are, however,
one and sometimes two patterers, of acknowledged
powers, who every now and then sell corn-salve&mdash;for
the restlessness of this class of people drives
them to incessant changes in their pursuits&mdash;and
their oratory is of a higher order. One of the
men in question speaks to the following <span class="lock">purport:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Here you are! here you are! all that has to
complain of corns. As fast as the shoemaker
lames you, I’ll cure you. If it wasn’t for me he
dursn’t sing at his work; bless you, but he knows
I’ll make his pinching easy to you. Hard corn,
soft corn, any corn&mdash;sold again! Thank you, sir,
you’ll not have to take a ’bus home when you’ve
used my corn-salve, and you can wear your boots
out then; you can’t when you’ve corns. Now,
in this little box you see a large corn which was
drawn by this very salve from the honourable
foot of the late lamented Sir Robert Peel. It’s
been in my possession three years and four months,
and though I’m a poor man&mdash;hard corn, soft corn, or
any corn&mdash;though I’m a poor man, the more’s the
pity, I wouldn’t sell that corn for the newest
sovereign coined. I call it the free-trade corn,
gen’l’men and leddis. No cutting and paring,
and sharpening penknives, and venturing on razors
to level your corns; this salve draws them
out&mdash;only one penny&mdash;and without pain. But
wonders can’t be done in a moment. To draw
out such a corn as I’ve shown you, the foot, the
whole foot, must be soaked five minutes in warm
soap and water. That makes the salve penetrate,
and draw the corn, which then falls out, in three
days, like a seed from a flower. Hard corn, soft
corn, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>The corn from “the honourable foot” of Sir
Robert Peel, or from the foot of any one likely to
interest the audience, has been scraped and
trimmed from a cow’s heel, and may safely be submitted
to the inspection and handling of the incredulous.
“There it is,” the corn-seller will
reiterate&mdash;“it speaks for itself.”</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]
</p></div>
</div>

<p>One practice&mdash;less common than it was, however,&mdash;of
the corn-salve street-seller, is to get a
friend to post a letter&mdash;expressive of delighted astonishment
at the excellence and rapidity of the
corn-cure&mdash;at some post-office not very contiguous.
If the salve-seller be anxious to remove the corns
of the citizens, he displays this letter, with the
genuine post-mark of Piccadilly, St. James’s-street,
Pall-mall, or any such quarter, to show
how the fashionable world avails itself of his
wares, cheap as they are, and fastidious as are
the fashionable! If the street-professional be
offering his corn-cures in a fashionable locality, he
produces a letter from Cheapside, or Cornhill&mdash;“there
it is, it speaks for itself”&mdash;to show how
the shrewd city-people, who were never taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
by street-sellers in their lives, and couldn’t be,
appreciated that particular corn-salve! Occasionally,
as the salve-seller is pattering, a man comes
impetuously forward, and says loudly, “Here,
doctor, let me have a shilling’s-worth. I bought
a penn’orth, and it cured one corn by bringing it
right out&mdash;here the d&mdash;&mdash;d thing is, it troubled me
seven year&mdash;and I’ve got other corns, and I’m
determined I’ll root out the whole family of
them. Come, now, look sharp, and put up a
shilling’s-worth.” The shilling’s-worth is gravely
handed to the applicant as if it were not only a
<i>boná fide</i>, but an ordinary occurrence in the way
of business.</p>

<p>One corn-salve seller&mdash;who was not in town at
the time of my inquiry into this curious matter&mdash;had,
I was assured, “and others might have” full
faith in the efficacy of the salve he vended. One
of his fellow-traders said to me, “Ay, sir, and he
has good reason for trusting to it for a cure; he
cured <i>me</i> of my corns, that I’m sure of; so there
can be no nonsense about it. He has a secret.”
On my asking this informant if he had tried his
own corn-salve, he laughed, and said “No! I’m
like the regular doctors that way, never tries my
own things.” The same man, who had no great
faith in what he sold being of any use in the cure
of “corn, wart, or bunion,” assured me&mdash;and I
have no doubt with truth&mdash;that he had sold his
remedy to persons utter strangers to him, who
had told him afterwards that it had cured their
corns. “False relics,” says a Spanish proverb,
“have wrought true miracles,” and to what cause
these corn-cures were attributable, it is not my
business to inquire.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of
the ingredients of a street corn-salve. “Anybody,”
said one man, “that understands how to
set about it, can get the recipe for 2<i>d.</i>” Resin,
1 lb., (costing 2<i>d.</i>); tallow, &frac14; lb. (1&frac12;<i>d.</i>); emerald
green (1<i>d.</i>); all boiled together. The emerald
green, I was told, was to “give it a colour.” The
colour is varied, but I have cited the most usual
mode of preparation. Attempts have been made
to give an aromatic odour to the salve, but all the
perfumes within the knowledge, or rather the
means, of the street-sellers, were overpowered by
the resin and the tallow, “and it has,” remarked
one dealer, “a physicky sort of smell as it is,
which answers.” The quantity I have cited would
supply a sufficiency of the composition for the
taking of “a sovereign in penn’orths.” In a
week or so the stuff becomes discoloured, often
from dust, and has to be re-boiled. Some of the
traders illustrate the mode of applying the salve
by carrying a lighted candle, and a few pieces of
leather, and showing how to soften the composition
and spread it on the leather. “After all,
sir,” said the man, who had faith in the virtues of
his fellow street-trader’s salve, “the regular thing,
such as I sell, may do good; I cannot say; but it
is very likely that the resin will draw the corn,
just as people apply cobbler’s wax, which has
resin in it. The chemists will sell you something
of the same sort as I do.”</p>

<p>The principal purchasers are working men, who
buy in the streets, and occasionally in the public-houses.
The trade, however, becomes less and
less remunerative. To take 15<i>s.</i> in a week is a
good week, and to take 10<i>s.</i> is more usual; the
higher receipt is no doubt attributable to a superior
patter being used, as men will give 1<i>d.</i> to be
amused by this street work, without caring
about the nostrum. Calculating that eight of these
traders take 10<i>s.</i> weekly&mdash;so allowing for the frequent
resort of the patterers to anything more attractive&mdash;we
find 208<i>l.</i> expended in the streets on
this salve. The profits of the seller are about
the same as his receipts, for 240 pennyworths can
be made out of materials costing only 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> The
further outlay necessary to this street profession is
a tray worth 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but a large old backgammon
board, which may be bought at the
second-hand shops for 1<i>s.</i> and sometimes for 6<i>d.</i>, is
more frequently used by the street purveyors of

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Glass and China
Cement, and of Razor Paste.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of glass and china cement is an old trade
in the streets, but one which becomes less and
less followed. Before the finer articles of crockeryware
became cheap as they are now, it was of
importance to mend, if possible, a broken dish of
better quality, and of more importance to mend a
china punch-bowl. Dishes, however, are now
much cheaper, and china punch-bowls are no
longer an indispensable part of even tavern festivity.</p>

<p>The sellers of this cement proclaim it as one
which will “cure any china, stone, or earthenware,
and make the broken parts adhere so firmly,
that if you let it fall again, it will break, not at
the part where it has been cemented, but at some
other. Only a halfpenny, or a penny a stick.”
These traders sometimes illustrate the adhesive
strength of the composition by producing a plate
or dish which has been cemented in different
places, and letting it fall, to break in some
hitherto sound part. This they usually succeed
in doing. For the cementing of glass the street
article is now perhaps never sold, and was but
scantily sold, I am informed, at any time, as the
junction was always unsightly.</p>

<p>There are now four men who sell this cement
in the streets, one usually to be found in Wilderness-row,
Goswell-street, being, perhaps, the one
who carries on the trade most regularly. They
all make their own cement; one of the receipts
being&mdash;1 lb. shellac (5<i>d.</i>), &frac14; lb. brimstone (&frac12;<i>d.</i>),
blended together until it forms a thick sort of
glue. This quantity makes half-a-crown’s-worth
of the cement for the purposes of retail. The
sellers do not confine themselves to one locality,
but are usually to be found in one or other of the
street-markets on a Saturday night. If each seller
take 5<i>s.</i> weekly (of which 4<i>s.</i> may be profit), we
find 52<i>l.</i> expended yearly by street customers in
this cement.</p>

<p>I include razor paste under this head, as sometimes,
and at one time more frequently than now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the same individual sold both articles, though not
at the same time.</p>

<p>There are twelve street-sellers of razor-paste,
but they seem to prefer “working” the distant
suburbs, or going on country rounds, as there
are often only three in London. It is still
vended, I am told, to clerks, who use it to
sharpen their pen-knives, but the paste, owing to
the prevalence of the use of steel pens, is now
almost a superfluity, compared to what it was.
It is bought also, and frequently enough in public-houses,
by working men, as a means of “setting”
their razors. The vendors make the paste themselves,
except two, who purchase of a street-seller.
The ingredients are generally fuller’s
earth (1<i>d.</i>), hog’s lard (1<i>d.</i>), and emery powder
(2<i>d.</i>). The paste is sold in boxes carried on a
tray, which will close and form a sort of case,
like a backgammon board. The quantity I have
given will make a dozen boxes (each sold at 1<i>d.</i>),
so that the profit is 7<i>d.</i> in the 1<i>s.</i>, for to the 4<i>d.</i>
paid for ingredients must be added 1<i>d.</i>, for the
cost of a dozen boxes. The paste is announced
as “warranted to put an edge to a razor or pen-knife
superior to anything ever before offered to
the public.” The street-sellers offer to prove this
by sharpening any gentleman’s pen-knife on the
paste spread on a piece of soldier’s old belt, which
sharpening, when required, they accomplish readily
enough. One of these paste-sellers, I was told,
had been apprenticed to a barber; another had
been a cutler, the remainder are of the ordinary
class of street-sellers.</p>

<p>Calculating that 6 men “work” the metropolis
daily, taking 2<i>s.</i> each per day (with 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> profit),
we find 187<i>l.</i> the amount of the street outlay.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Crackers and
Detonating Balls.</span></h3>

<p>This trade, I am informed by persons familiar
with it, would be much more frequently carried
on by street-folk, and in much greater numbers,
were it not the one which of all street callings finds
the least toleration from the police. “You must
keep your eyes on both corners of the street,” said
one man, “when you sell crackers; and what good
is it the police stopping us? The boys have only
to go to a shop, and then it’s all right.”</p>

<p>The trade is only known in the streets at
holiday seasons, and is principally carried on for
a few days before and after the 5th of November,
and again at Christmas-tide. “Last November was
good for crackers,” said one man; “it was either
Guy Faux day, or the day before, I’m not
sure which now, that I took 15<i>s.</i>, and nearly
all of boys, for waterloo crackers and ball crackers
(the common trade names), ‘waterloo’ being
the ‘pulling crackers.’ At least three parts was
ball crackers. I sold them from a barrow, wheeling
it about as if it was hearthstone, and just
saying quietly when I could, ‘Six a penny crackers.’
The boys soon tell one another. All sorts
bought of me; doctors’ boys, school boys, pages,
boys as was dressed beautiful, and boys as hadn’t
neither shoes nor stockings. It’s sport for them
all.” The same man told me he did well at what
he called “last Poram fair,” clearing 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in
three days, or rather evenings or nights. “Poram
fair, sir,” he said, “is a sort of feast among the
Jews, always three weeks I’ve heard, afore their
Passover, and I then work Whitechapel and all
that way.”</p>

<p>I inquired of a man who had carried on this
street trade for a good many years, it might be
ten or twelve, if he had noticed the uses to which
his boy-customers put his not very innocent
wares, and he entered readily into the subject.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” he said, “they’re not all boy-customers,
as you call them, but they’re far the
most. I’ve sold to men, and often to drunken
men. What larks there is with the ball-crackers!
One man lost his eye at Stepney Fair, but that’s
6 or 7 years ago, from a lark with crackers. The
rights of it I never exactly understood, but I
know he lost his eye, from the dry gravel in the
ball-cracker bouncing into it. But it’s the boys
as is fondest of crackers. I sold ’em all last
Christmas, and made my 5<i>s.</i> and better on Boxing-day.
I was sold out before 6 o’clock, as I had a
regular run at last&mdash;just altogether. After that,
I saw one lad go quietly behind a poor lame old
woman and pull a Waterloo close behind her ear;
he was a biggish boy and tidily dressed; and the
old body screamed, ‘I’m shot.’ She turned about,
and the boy says, says he, ‘Does your grandmother
know you’re out? It’s a improper thing,
so it is, for you to be walking out by yourself.’
You should have seen her passion! But as she
was screaming out, ‘You saucy wagabone! You
boys is all wagabones. People can’t pass for you.
I’ll give you in charge, I will,” the lad was off
like a shot.</p>

<p>“But one of the primest larks I ever saw that
way was last winter, in a street by Shoreditch.
An old snob that had a bulk was making it all
right for the night, and a lad goes up. I don’t
know what he said to the old boy, but I saw him
poke something, a last I think it was, against the
candle, put it out, and then run off. In a minute,
three or four lads that was ready, let fly at the bulk
with their ball-crackers, and there was a clatter
as if the old snob had tumbled down, and knocked
his lasts down; but he soon had his head out&mdash;he
was Irish, I think&mdash;and he first set up a roar
like a Smithfield bull, and he shouts, ‘I’m kilt
intirely wid the murthering pistols! Po-lice!
Po-o-lice!’ He seemed taken quite by surprise&mdash;for
they was capital crackers&mdash;I think he
couldn’t have been used to bulks, or he would
have been used to pelting; but how he did bellow,
surely.</p>

<p>“I think it was that same night too, I saw a
large old man, buttoned up, but seeming as if he
was fine-dressed for a party, in a terrible way in the
Commercial-road. I lived near there then. There
was three boys afore me&mdash;and very well they did it&mdash;one
of ’em throws a ball-cracker bang at the old
gent’s feet, just behind him, and makes him jump
stunning, and the boy walks on with his hands in
his pocket, as if he know’d nothing about it.
Just after that another boy does the same, and
then the t’other boy; and the old gent&mdash;Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
how he swore! It was shocking in such a respectable
man, as I told him, when he said, <i>I’d</i>
crackered him! ‘Me cracker you,’ says I; ‘it ’ud
look better if you’d have offered to treat a poor
fellow to a pint of beer with ginger in it, and the
chill off, than talk such nonsense.’ As we was
having this jaw, one of the boys comes back and
lets fly again; and the old gent saw how it was,
and he says, ‘Now, if you’ll run after that lad,
and give him a d&mdash;&mdash;d good hiding, you shall
have the beer.’ ‘Money down, sir,’ says I, ‘if
you mean honour bright;’ but he grumbled something,
and walked away. I saw him soon after,
talking to a Bobby, so I made a short cut home.”</p>

<p>At the fairs near London there is a considerable
sale of these combustibles; and they are
often displayed on large stalls in the fair. They
furnish the means of practical jokes to the people
on their return. “After last Whitsun Greenwich
Fair,” said a street-seller to me, “I saw a gent in a
white choker, like a parson, look in at a pastry-cook’s
shop, as is jist by the Elephant (and Castle),
a-waiting for a ’bus, I s’pose. There was an old
’oman with a red face standing near him; and I
saw a lad, very quick, pin something to one’s
coat and the t’other’s gown. They turned jist
arter, and bang goes a Waterloo, and they looks
savage one at another; and hup comes that indentical
boy, and he says to the red faced ’oman,
a pointing to the white choker, ‘Marm, I seed
him a twiddling with your gown. He done it for
a lark arter the fair, and ought to stand something.’
So the parson, if he were a parson,
walked away.”</p>

<p>There are eight makers, I am told, who supply
the street-sellers and the small shops with these
crackers. The wholesale price is 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> a gross,
the “cracker-balls” being the dearest. The retail
price in the streets is from six to twelve a penny,
according to the appearance and eagerness of the
purchaser. Some street traders carry these commodities
on trays, and very few are stationary,
except at fairs. I am assured, that for a few
days last November, from 50 to 60 men and
women were selling crackers in the streets, of
course “on the sly.” In so irregular and surreptitious
a trade, it is not possible even to approximate
to statistics. The most intelligent man
that I met with, acquainted, as he called it,
“with all the ins and outs of the trade,” calculated
that in November and Christmas, 100<i>l.</i> at
least was expended in the streets in these combustibles,
and another 100<i>l.</i> in the other parts of
the year. About Tower-hill, Ratcliff-highway (or
“the Highway,” as street-sellers often call it), and
in Wapping and Shadwell, the sale of crackers is
the best. The sellers are the ordinary street-sellers,
and no patter is required.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Lucifer-Matches.</span></h3>

<p>Under this head I shall speak only of those who
<i>sell</i> the matches, apart from those who, in proffering
lucifer boxes, mix up trade with mendicancy.
The latter class I have spoken of, and shall treat
of them more fully under the head of “the London
Poor.”</p>

<p>Until “lucifers” became cheap and in general
use, the matches sold by the street-folks, and there
were numbers in the trade, were usually prepared
by themselves. The manufactures were simple
enough. Wooden splints, twice or thrice the
length of the lucifer matches now in use, were
prepared, and dipped into brimstone, melted in an
iron ladle. The matches were never, as now,
self-igniting, or rather ignitable by rapid friction;
but it was necessary to “strike a light” by the
concussion of a flint and steel, the sparks from
which were communicated to tinder kept in a
“box.”</p>

<p>The brimstone match-sellers were of all ages,
but principally, I am told, old people. Many of
them during, and for some years after the war,
wore tattered regimentals, or some remains of
military paraphernalia, and had been, or assumed
to have been, soldiers, but not entitled to a pension;
the same with seamen. I inquired of
some of the present race of match-sellers what
became of the “old brimstones,” as I heard them
called, but from them I could gain little information.
An old groundsel-gatherer told me that
some went into his trade. Others, I learned,
“took to pins,” and others to song or tract selling.
Indeed the brimstone match-sellers not unfrequently
carried a few songs to vend with their
matches. It must be borne in mind that, 15
years ago, those street trades, into which any one
who is master of a few pence can now embark,
were less numerous. Others of the match-sellers,
with rounds, or being known men, displaced their
“brimstones” for “lucifers,” and traded on as
usual. I heard of one old man, now dead, who
made a living on brimstone-matches by selling a
good quantity in Hackney, Stoke Newington, and
Islington, and who long refused to sell lucifer-matches;
“they was new-fangled rubbish,” he said,
“and would soon have their day.” He found his
customers, however, fall off, and in apprehension
of losing them all, he was compelled to move with
the times.</p>

<p>“I believe, sir,” said one man, still a street-seller,
but not having sold matches of any kind
for years,&mdash;“I believe I was the first who
hawked ‘Congreves,’ or ‘instantaneous lights;’
they weren’t called ‘lucifers’ for a good while
after. I bought them at Mr. Jones’s light-house in
the Strand, and if I remember right, for it must
be more than 20 years ago, between 1820 and
1830, Mr. Jones had a patent somehow about
them. I bought them at 7<i>s.</i> a dozen boxes, and
sold them at 1<i>s.</i> a box. I’m not sure how many
matches was in a box, but I think it was 100.
You’ll get as much for a farthing now, as you
would for a shilling then. The matches were
lighted by being drawn quickly through sand-paper.
I sold them for a twelvemonth, and had
the trade all to myself. As far as I know, I had;
for I never met with or heard of anybody else in
it all that time. I did decent at it. I suppose I
cleared my 15<i>s.</i> a week. The price kept the same
while I was in the business. I sold them at city
offices. I supplied the Phœnix in Lombard-street,
I remember, and the better sort of shops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
People liked them when they wanted to light a
candle in a hurry, in places where there was no
fire to seal a letter, or such like. There was no
envelopes in them days. The penny-postage
brought <i>them</i> in. I was sometimes told not to
carry such things there again, as they didn’t want
the house set on fire by keeping such dangerous
things in it. Now, I suppose, lucifers are in every
house, and that there’s not a tinder-box used in
all London.” Such appears to have been the
beginning of the extensive street-trade in these
chemical preparations now carried on. At the
twelvemonth’s end, my informant went into another
line of business.</p>

<p>The “German Congreves” were soon after introduced,
and were at first sold wholesale at the
“English and German” swag-shops in Houndsditch,
at 2<i>s.</i> the dozen boxes, and were retailed
at 3<i>d.</i>, 4<i>d.</i>, and sometimes as high as 6<i>d.</i> the box.
These matches, I am told, “kept their hold”
about five years, when they ceased to be a portion
of the street trade. The German Congreves were
ignited by being drawn along a slip of sand-paper,
at the bottom of the box, as is done at
present; with some, however, a double piece of
sand-paper was sold for purposes of igniting.</p>

<p>After this time cheaper and cheaper matches
were introduced, and were sold in the streets immediately
on their introduction. At first, the
cheaper matches had an unpleasant smell, and
could hardly be kept in a bed-room, but that was
obviated, and the trade progressed to its present
extent.</p>

<p>The lucifer-match boxes, the most frequent in
the street-trade, are bought by the poor persons
selling them in the streets, at the manufacturers,
or at oil-shops, for a number of oilmen buy largely
of the manufacturers, and can “supply the trade”
at the same rate as the manufacturer. The price
is 2&frac14;<i>d.</i> the dozen boxes, each box containing 150
matches. Some of the boxes (German made) are
round, and many used to be of tin, but these are
rarely seen now. The prices are proportionate.
The common price of a lucifer box in the streets
is &frac12;<i>d.</i>, but many buyers, I am told, insist upon
and obtain three a penny, which they do generally
of some one who supplies them regularly. The
trade is chiefly itinerant.</p>

<p>One feeble old man gave me the following
account of his customers. He had been in the
employ of market-gardeners, carmen, and others,
whose business necessitated the use of carts and
horses. In his old age he was unable to do any
hard work; he was assisted, however, by his
family, especially by one son living in the
country; he had a room in the house of a daughter,
who was a widow, but his children were
only working people, with families, he said, and so
he sold a few lucifers “as a help,” and to have
the comfort of a bit of tobacco, and buy an old
thing in the way of clothing without troubling
any one. Out of his earnings, too, he paid 6<i>d.</i> a
week for the schooling of one of his daughter’s
children.</p>

<p>“I <i>sell</i> these lucifers, sir,” he said, in answer
to my inquiries, “I never beg with them: I’d
scorn it. My children help me, as I’ve told you;
I did my best for them when I was able, and so
I have a just sort of claim on them. Well,
indeed, then, sir, as you ask me, if I had only
myself to depend upon, why I couldn’t live. I
must beg or go into the house, and I don’t know
which I should take to worst at 72. I’ve been
selling lucifers about five years, for I was worn
out with hard work and rheumatics when I was
65 or 66. I go regular rounds, about 2 miles in a
day, or 2&frac12;, or if it’s fine 3 miles or more from
where I live, and the same distance back, for I
can sometimes walk middling if I can do nothing
else. I carry my boxes tied up in a handkerchief,
and hold 2 or 3 in my hand. I’m ashamed
to hold them out on any rail where I aint known;
and never do if there isn’t a good-humoured
looking person to be seen below, or through the
kitchen window. But my eyesight aint good,
and I make mistakes, and get snapped up very
short at times. Yesterday, now, I was lucky
in my small way. There’s a gentleman, that if I
can see him, I can always sell boxes to at 1<i>d.</i>
a piece. That’s his price, he says, and he takes
no change if I offer it. I saw him yesterday at
his own door, and says he, ‘Well, old greybeard,
I haven’t seen you for a long time. Here’s 1<i>s.</i>,
leave a dozen boxes.’ I told him I had only 11
left; but he said, ‘O, it’s all the same,’ and he
told a boy that was crossing the hall to take them
into the kitchen, and we soon could hear the
housekeeper grumbling quite loud&mdash;perhaps she
didn’t know her master could hear&mdash;about being
bothered with rubbish that people took in master
with; and the gentleman shouts out, ‘Some of
you stop that old &mdash;&mdash; mouth, will you? She
wants a profit out of them in her bills.’ All was
quiet then, and he says to me quite friendly, ‘If
she wasn’t the best cook in London I’d have
quitted her long since, by G&mdash;.’” The old man
chuckled no little as he related this; he then went
on, “He’s a swearing man, but a good man, I’m
sure, and I don’t know why he’s so kind to me.
Perhaps he is to others. I’m ashamed to hold
my boxes to the ary rails, ’cause so many does
that to beg. I sell lucifers both to mistresses and
maids. Some will have 3 for a 1<i>d.</i>, and though
it’s a poor profit, I do it, for they say, ‘O, if you
come this way constant, we’ll buy of you whenever
we want. If you won’t give 3 a penny,
there’s plenty will.’ I sell, too, in some small
streets, Lisson-grove way, to women that see me
from their windows, and come down to the door.
They’re needle-workers I think. They say sometimes,
‘I’m glad I’ve seen you, for it saves me
the trouble of running out.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’m sure I hardly know how many
boxes I sell. On a middling good day I sell
2 dozen, on a good day 3 dozen, on a bad day
not a dozen, sometimes not half-a-dozen, and
sometimes, but not often, not more than a
couple. Then in bad weather I don’t go out,
and time hangs very heavy if it isn’t a Monday;
for every Monday I buy a threepenny paper
of a newsman for 2<i>d.</i>, and read it as well as I
can with my old eyes and glasses, and get my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
daughter to read a bit to me in the evening, and
next day I send the paper to my son in the
country, and so save him buying one. As well as
I can tell I sell about 9 dozen boxes a week, one
week with another, and clear from 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
It’s employment for me as well as a help.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to estimate the precise number of
persons who really sell lucifer matches as a means
of subsistence, or as a principal means. There
are many, especially girls and women, the majority
being Irishwomen, who do not directly
solicit charity, and do not even say, “Buy a box
of lucifers from a poor creature, to get her a
ha’porth of bread;” or, “please a bit of broken
victuals, if it’s only cold potatoes, for a box of the
best lucifers.” Yet these match-sellers look so
imploringly down an area, or through a window,
some “shouldering” a young child the while, and
remain there so pertinaciously that a box is bought,
or a halfpenny given, often merely to get rid of
the applicant.</p>

<p>An intelligent man, a street-seller, and familiar
with street-trading generally, whom I questioned
on the subject, said: “It’s really hard to tell, sir,
but I should calculate this way. It’s the real
sellers you ask about; them as tries to live on
their selling lucifers, or as their main support. I
have worked London and the outside places&mdash;yes,
I mean the suburbs&mdash;in ten rounds, or districts, but
six is better, for you can then go the same round the
same day next week, and so get known. The real
sellers, in my opinion, is old men and women out
of employ, or past work, and to beg they are
ashamed. I’ve read the Bible you see, sir, though
I’ve had too much to do with gay persons even to
go to church. I should say that in each of those
ten rounds, or at any rate, splicing one with
another, was twenty persons really selling lucifers.
Yes, and depending a good deal upon them,
for they’re an easy carriage for an infirm body,
and as ready a sale as most things. I don’t
reckon them as begs, or whines, or sticks to a
house for an hour, but them as sells; in my
opinion, they’re 200, and no more. All the
others dodges, in one way or other, on pity and
charity. There’s one lurk that’s getting common
now. A man well dressed, and very clean, and
wearing gloves, knocks at a door, and asks to
speak to the master or mistress. If he succeeds,
he looks about him as if he was ashamed, and
then he pulls out of his coat-pocket a lucifer box
or two, and asks, as a favour, to be allowed to sell
one, as reduced circumstances drive him to do so.
He doesn’t beg, but I don’t reckon him a seller,
for he has always some story or other to tell,
that’s all a fakement.” Most dwellers in a
suburb will have met with one of these well-dressed
match-sellers.</p>

<p>Adopting my informant’s calculation, and supposing
that each of these traders take, on lucifers
alone, but 4<i>s.</i> weekly, selling nine dozen (with a
profit to the seller of from 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), we
find 2080<i>l.</i> expended in this way. The matches
are sold also at stalls, with other articles, in the
street markets, and elsewhere; but this traffic, I
am told, becomes smaller, and only amounts to one-tenth
of the amount I have specified as taken by
itinerants. These street-sellers reside in all parts
of town which I have before specified as the
quarters of the poor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Cigar Lights,
or Fuzees.</span></h3>

<p>This is one of the employments to which boys,
whom neglect, ill-treatment, destitution, or a
vagrant disposition, have driven or lured to a
street life, seem to resort to almost as readily as to
the offers, “Old your ’os, sir?” “Shall I carry
your passel, marm?”</p>

<p>The trifling capital required to enter into the
business is one cause of its numbering many followers.
The “fuzees,” as I most frequently heard
them called, are sold at the “Congreve shops,”
and are chiefly German made. At one time, indeed,
they were announced as “German tinder.”
The wholesale charge is 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> per 1000 “lights.”
The 1000 lights are apportioned into fifty rows,
each of twenty self-igniting matches; and these
“rows” are sold in the streets, one or two
for &frac12;<i>d.</i>, and two, three, or four 1<i>d.</i> It is common
enough for a juvenile fuzee-seller to buy only
500; so that 2&frac14;<i>d.</i> supplies his stock in trade.</p>

<p>The boys (for the majority of the street-traders
who sell <i>only</i> fuzees, are boys) frequent the approaches
to the steam-boat piers, the omnibus
stands, and whatever places are resorted to by
persons who love to smoke in the open air. Some
of these young traders have neither shoes nor
stockings, more especially the Irish lads, who are
at least half the number, and their apology for a
cap fully displays the large red ears, and flat
features, which seem to distinguish a class of the
Irish children in the streets of London. Some
Irish boys hold out their red-tipped fuzees with
an appealing look, meant to be plaintive, and say,
in a whining tone, “Spend a halfpenny on a
poor boy, your honour.” Others offer them,
without any appealing look or tone, either in silence,
or saying&mdash;“Buy a fuzee to light your
pipe or cigar, sir; a row of lights for a &frac12;<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>I met with one Irish boy, of thirteen or fourteen
years of age, who was offering fuzees to the
persons going to Chalk Farm fair on Easter
Tuesday, but the rain kept away many visitors,
and the lad could hardly find a customer. He
was literally drenched, for his skin, shining with
the rain, could be seen about his arms and knees
through the slits of his thin corduroy jacket and
trowsers, and he wore no shirt.</p>

<p>“It’s oranges I sell in ginral, your honour,” he
said, “and it’s on oranges I hopes to be next
week, plaze God. But mother&mdash;it’s orange-selling
she is too&mdash;wanted to make a grand show for
Aister wake, and tuk the money to do it, and put
me on the fuzees. It’s the thruth I’m telling
your honour. She thought I might be after
making a male’s mate” (meal’s meat) “out of them,
intirely; but the sorra a male I’ll make to day
if it cost me a fardin, for I haven’t tuk one. I
niver remimber any fader; mother and me lives
together somehow, glory be to God; but it’s often
knowin’ what it is to be hungry we are. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
sould fuzees before, when ingans, and nuts, and
oranges was dear and not for the poor to buy,
but I niver did so bad as to-day. A gintleman
once said to me: ‘Here, Pat, yer sowl, you look
hungry. Here’s a thirteener for yez; go and get
drunk wid it.’ Och, no, your honour, he wasn’t
an Irish gintleman; it was afther mocking me he
was, God save him.” On my asking the boy if
he felt hurt at this mockery, he answered, slily,
with all his air of simplicity, “Sure, thin, wasn’t
there the shillin’? For it was a shillin’ he gave
me, glory be to God. No, I niver heard it called
a thirteener before, but mother has. Och, thin,
sir, indeed, and it’s could and wet I am. I have
a new shirt, as was giv to mother for me by a
lady, but I wouldn’t put it on sich a day as this,
your honour, sir. I’ll go to mass in it ivery
Sunday. I’ve made 6<i>d.</i> a day and sometimes
more a sellin’ fuzees, wid luck, God be praised,
but the bad wither’s put me out intirely this
time.”</p>

<p>The fuzee-sellers frequently offer their wares at
the bars of public-houses in the daytime, and
sometimes dispose of them to those landlords who
sell cigars. From the best information I can command
there are now upwards of 200 persons
selling fuzees in the streets of the metropolis. But
the trade is often collateral. The cigar-seller offers
fuzees, play-bill sellers (boys) do so sometimes at
the doors of the theatres to persons coming out,
the pipe-sellers also carry them; they are sometimes
sold along with lucifer matches, and at
miscellaneous stalls. It will, I believe, be accurate
to state that in the streets there are generally
100 persons subsisting, or endeavouring to subsist,
on the sale of fuzees alone. It may be estimated
also that each of these traders averages a receipt
of 10<i>d.</i> a day (with a profit exceeding 6<i>d.</i>), so
that 1300<i>l.</i> is yearly laid out in the streets in this
way.</p>

<p>Of the fuzee-selling lads, those who are parentless,
or runaway, sleep in the lodging-houses, in
the better conducted of which the master or deputy
takes charge of the stock of fuzees or lucifer-matches
during the night to avert the risk of fire;
in others these combustibles are stowed anywhere
at the discretion, or indiscretion, of the lodgers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Gutta-Percha
Heads.</span></h3>

<p>There are many articles which, having become
cheap in the shops, find their way to the street-traders,
and after a brief, or comparatively brief,
and prosperous trade has been carried on in them,
gradually disappear. These are usually things
which are grotesque or amusing, but of no utility,
and they are supplanted by some more attractive
novelty&mdash;a main attraction being that it is a
novelty.</p>

<p>Among such matters of street-trade are the
elastic toys called “gutta-percha heads;” these,
however, have no gutta-percha in their composition,
but consist solely of a composition made of
glue and treacle&mdash;the same as is used for printer’s
rollers. The heads are small coloured models of
the human face, usually with projecting nose and
chin, and wide or distorted mouth, which admit
of being squeezed into a different form of features,
their elasticity causing them to return to
the original caste. The trade carried on in the
streets in these toys was at one time extensive,
but it seems now to be gradually disappearing.
On a fine day a little after noon, last week, there
was not one “head” exposed for sale in any of
the four great street markets of Leather-lane, the
Brill, Tottenham-court-road including the Hampstead-road,
and High-street, Camden-town.</p>

<p>The trade became established in the streets upwards
of two years ago. At first, I am told by a
street-seller, himself one of the first, there were
six “head-sellers,” who “worked” the parks and
their vicinity. My informant one day sold a gross
of heads in and about Hyde-park, and a more
fortunate fellow-trader on the same day sold 1&frac12;
gross. The heads were recommended, whenever
opportunity offered, by a little patter. “Here,”
one man used to say, “here’s the Duke of Wellington’s
head for 1<i>d.</i> It’s modelled from the
statty on horseback, but is a improvement. His
nose speaks for itself. Sir Robert Peel’s only 1<i>d.</i>
Anybody you please is 1<i>d.</i>; a free choice and
no favour. The Queen and all the Royal Family
1<i>d.</i> apiece.” As the street-seller offered to dispose
of the model of any eminent man’s head and
face, he held up some one of the most grotesque
of the number. Another man one Saturday
evening sold five or six dozen to costermongers
and others in the street markets “pattering” them
off as the likenesses of any policeman who might
be obnoxious to the street-traders! This was
when the trade was new. The number of sellers
was a dozen in the second week; it was soon
twenty-five, all confining themselves to the sale of
the heads; besides these the heads were offered to
the street-buying public by many of the stationary
street-folk, whose stock partook of a miscellaneous
character. The men carrying on this traffic were
of the class of general street-sellers.</p>

<p>“The trade was spoiled, sir,” said an informant,
“by so many going into it, but I’ve heard that
it’s not bad in parts of the country now. The
sale was always best in the parks, I believe, and
Sundays was the best days. I don’t pretend to
be learned about religion, but I know that many
a time after I’d earned next to nothing in a wet
week, it came a fine Sunday morning, and I
took as much as got me and my wife and
children a good dinner of meat and potatoes, and
sometimes, when we could depend on it, smoking
hot from the baker’s oven; and I then felt I had
something to thank God for. You see, sir, when
a man’s been out all the week, and often with
nothing to call half a dinner, and his wife’s earnings
only a few pence by sewing at home, with
three young children to take care of, you’re
nourished and comforted, and your strength keeps
up, by a meat dinner on a Sunday, quietly in
your own room. But them as eats their dinner
without having to earn it, can’t understand about
that, and as the Sunday park trade was stopped,
the police drive us about like dogs, not gentlemen’s
dogs, but stray or mad dogs. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
seems there’s some sort of a new police. I can’t
understand a bit of it, and I don’t want to, for
the old police is trouble enough.”</p>

<p>The gutta-percha heads are mostly bought at the
“English and German” swag-shops. A few are
made by the men who sell them in the streets.
The “swag” price is 1<i>s.</i> the gross; at one time
the swag man demurred to sell less than half a
gross, but now when the demand is diminished, a
dozen is readily supplied for 8<i>d.</i> The street
price retail, is and always was 1<i>d.</i> a head. The
principal purchasers in the street are boys and
young men, with a few tradesmen or working
people, “such as can afford a penny or two,” who
buy the “gutta-percha” heads for their children.
There used to be a tolerable trade in public
houses, where persons enjoying themselves bought
them “for a lark,” but this trade has now
dwindled to a mere nothing. One of the “larks,”
an informant knew to be practised, was to attach
the head to a piece of paper or card, write upon
it some one’s name, make it up into a parcel, and
send it to the flattered individual. The same man
had sold heads to young women, not servant-maids
he thought, but in some not very ill paid
employment, and he believed, from their manner
when buying, for some similar purpose of “larking.”
When the heads were a novelty, he sold a good
many to women of the town.</p>

<p>There are now no street-folks who depend upon
the sale of these gutta-percha heads, but they sell
them occasionally. The usual mode is to display
them on a tray, and now, generally with other
things. One man showed me his box, which,
when the lid was raised, he carried as a tray
slung round his neck, and it contained gutta-percha
heads, exhibition medals, and rings and
other penny articles of jewellery.</p>

<p>There are at present, I am informed, 30 persons
selling gutta-percha heads in the streets, some of
them confining their business solely to those articles.
In this number, however, I do not include those
who are both makers and sellers. Their average
receipts, I am assured, do not exceed 5<i>s.</i> a week
each, for, though some may take 15<i>s.</i> a week,
others, and generally the stationary head-sellers,
do not take 1<i>s.</i> The profit to the street retailer
is one third of his receipts. From this calculation
it appears, that if the present rate of sale continue,
390<i>l.</i> is spent yearly in these street toys. At
one time it was far more than twice the amount.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Fly-Papers
and Beetle-Wafers.</span></h3>

<p>Fly-Papers came, generally, into street-traffic, I
am informed, in the summer of 1848.</p>

<p>The fly-papers are sold wholesale at many of
the oil-shops, but the principal shop for the supply
of the street-traders is in Whitechapel. The
wholesale price is 2&frac14;<i>d.</i> a dozen, and the (street)
retail charge &frac12;<i>d.</i> a paper, or three 1<i>d.</i> A young
man, to whom I was referred, and whom I found
selling, or rather bartering, crockery, gave me the
following account of his experience of the fly-paper
trade. He was a rosy-cheeked, strong-built
young fellow, and said he thought he was “getting
on” in his present trade. He spoke merrily of
his troubles, as I have found common among his
class, when they are over.</p>

<p>“My father had a milk-walk,” he said, “and
when he died I was without money and had
nothing to do, but I soon got a place with a single
gentleman. He had a small house, and kept only
me and a old housekeeper. I was to make myself
generally useful, but when I first went, the
most I had to do was to look after a horse that
master had. Master never was on horseback in
his life, but he took Skipjack&mdash;that was the horse’s
name, he was rising six&mdash;for a debt, and kept him
two months, till he could sell him to his mind.
Master took a largeish garden&mdash;for he was fond of
growing flowers and vegetables, and made presents
of them&mdash;just before poor Skipjack went, and I
was set to work in it, besides do my house-work.
It was a easy place, and I was wery comfable.
But master, who was a good master and a friend
to a poor man, as I know, got into difficulties; he
was something in the City; I never understood
what; and one night, when I’d been above a
year and a-half with him, he told me I must go,
for he couldn’t afford to keep me any longer. Next
day he was arrested, quite sudden I believe, and
sent to prison for debt. I had a good character,
but nobody cared for one from a man in prison,
and in a month my money was out, and my last
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> went for an advertisement, what was no
good to me. I then took to holding horses or
anything that way, and used to sleep in the parks
or by the road-sides where it was quiet. I did
that for a month and more. I’ve sometimes never
tasted food all day, and used to quench myself
(so he worded it) with cold water from the
pumps. It took off the hunger for a time. I got
to know other boys that was living as I was, and
when I could afford it I slept at lodging-houses, the
boys took me to or told me about. One evening
a gentleman gave me 1<i>s.</i> for catching his horse
that he’d left standing, but it had got frightened,
and run off. Next morning I went into the fly-paper
trade,&mdash;it’s nearly two years ago, I think&mdash;because
a boy I slept with did tidy in it. We
bought the papers at the first shop as was open,
and then got leave of the deputy of the lodging-house
to catch all the flies we could, and we stuck
them thick on the paper, and fastened the paper
to our hats. I used to think, when I was in service,
how a smart livery hat, with a cockade to it,
would look, but instead of that I turned out, the
first time in my life that ever I sold anything,
with my hat stuck round with flies. I felt so
ashamed I could have cried. I was miserable, I
felt so awkerd. But I spent my last 2<i>d.</i> in some
gin and milk to give me courage, and that brightened
me up a bit, and I set to work. I went
Mile-end way, and got out of the main streets,
and I suppose I’d gone into streets and places
where there hadn’t often been fly-papers before,
and I soon had a lot of boys following me, and I
felt, almost, as if I’d picked a pocket, or done
something to be ’shamed of. I could hardly cry
‘Catch ’em alive, only a halfpenny!’ But I
found I could sell my papers to public-houses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
shopkeepers, such as grocers and confectioners,
and that gave me pluck. The boys caught flies,
and then came up to me, and threw them against
my hat, and if they stuck the lads set up a shout.
I stuck to the trade, however, and took 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
3<i>s.</i> every day that week, more than half of it
profit, and on Saturday I took 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The trade
is all to housekeepers. I called at open shops and
looked up at the windows, or held up my hat at
private houses, and was sometimes beckoned to go
in and sell my papers. Women bought most, I
think. ‘Nasty things,’ they used to say, ‘there’s
no keeping nothing clean for them.’ I stuck to the
trade for near two months, and then I was worth
13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and had got a pair of good shoes, and a
good second-hand shirt, with one to change it;
and next I did a little in tins and hardware, at
the places where I used to go my fly rounds, and
in the winter I got into the crock-trade, with
another young fellow for a mate, and I’m in it
yet, and getting a tidy connection, I think.”</p>

<p>Some of the fly-paper sellers make their stock-in-trade,
but three-fourths of the number buy them
ready-made. The street-sellers make them of old
newspapers or other waste-paper, no matter how
dirty. To the paper they apply turpentine and
common coach varnish, some using resin instead of
varnish, and occasionally they dash a few grains
of sugar over the composition when spread upon
the paper.</p>

<p>Last summer, I was informed, there were fifty
or sixty persons selling fly-papers and beetle
wafers in the streets; some of them boys, and
all of them of the general class of street-sellers,
who “take” to any trade for which 1<i>s.</i> suffices
as capital. Their average earnings may be estimated
at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, about one-half being
profit. This gives a street outlay, say for a
“season” of ten weeks, of 375<i>l.</i>, calculating fifty
sellers.</p>

<p>A few of these street traders carried a side of a
newspaper, black with flies, attached to a stick,
waving it like a flag. The cries were “Catch ’em
alive! Catch ’em alive for &frac12;<i>d.</i>!” “New method
of destroying thousands!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Miscellaneous
Manufactured Articles.</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the more staple wares which form
the street trade in manufactured articles of a
miscellaneous character, are many, as I said before,
which have been popular for a while and are now
entirely disused. In the course of my inquiry it
was remarkable how oblivious I found many of
the street-sellers as to what they had sold at
various periods. “O dear, yes sir, I’ve sold
all sorts of things in the streets besides what
I’m on now; first one and then another as
promised a few pence,” was the substance of a remark
I frequently heard; but <i>what</i> was meant by
the one and the other thing thus sold they had a
difficulty to call to mind, but on a hint being
thrown out they could usually give the necessary
details. From the information I acquired I select
the following curious matter.</p>

<p>Six or seven years ago <i>Galvanic Rings</i> were
sold extensively by the street-folk. These were
clumsy lead-coloured things, which were described
by the puffing shop-keepers, and in due course by
the street-sellers, as a perfect amulet; a thing
which by its mere contact with the finger would
not only cure but prevent “fits, rheumatics, and
cramps.” On my asking a man who had sold
them if these were all the ailments of which he
and the others proclaimed the galvanic rings an
infallible cure, he answered: “Like the quack
medicines you read about, sir, in ’vertisements, we
said they was good for anything anybody complained
of or was afraid was coming on them, but
we went mostly for rheumatics. A sight of tin
some of the shopkeepers must have made, for
what we sold at 1<i>d.</i> they got 6<i>d.</i> a piece for.
Then for gold galvanics&mdash;and I’ve been told they
was gilt&mdash;they had 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. The streets is
nothing to the shops on a dodge. I’ve been told
by people as I’d sold galvanics to, that they’d had
benefit from them. I suppose that was just superstitious.
I think Hyams did the most of any
house in galvanics.”</p>

<p>The men selling these rings&mdash;for the business
was carried on almost entirely by men&mdash;were the
regular street-traders, who sell “first one thing
and then another.” They were carried in boxes,
as I have shown medals are now, and they generally
formed a portion of the street-jeweller’s stock,
whether he were itinerant or stationary. The
purchasers were labourers in the open air, such as
those employed about buildings, whose exposure
to the alternations of heat and cold render them
desirous of a cure for, or preventive against rheumatism.
The costermongers were also purchasers,
and in the course of my inquiries among that
numerous body, I occasionally saw a galvanic ring
still worn by a few, and those chiefly, I think,
fish-sellers.</p>

<p>Nor was the street or shop trade in these galvanic
rings confined to amulets for the finger. I
heard of one elderly woman, then a prosperous
street-seller in the New Cut, who slept with a
galvanic ring on every toe, she suffered so much
from cramp and rheumatism! There were also
galvanic shields, which were to be tied round the
waist, and warranted “to cure all over.” They
were retailed at 6<i>d.</i> each. Galvanic earrings were
likewise a portion of this manufacture. They
were not “drops” from the ear, but filled behind
and around it as regards the back of the skull,
and were to avert rheumatic attacks, and even
aching from the head. The street price was 1<i>s.</i>
the pair. Galvanic bracelets, handsomely gilt,
were 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the pair. But the sale of all these
higher-priced charms was a mere nonentity compared
to that of the penny rings.</p>

<p>Another trade&mdash;if it may be classed under this
head&mdash;carried on by great numbers and with
great success for a while, was that of <i>cards with
the Lord’s Prayer in the compass of a sixpence</i>.
This was an engraving&mdash;now and then offered in
the streets still&mdash;strictly fulfilling the announcement
as to the compass in which the Prayer was
contained, with the addition of a drawing of the
Bible, as part of the engraving, “within the sixpence.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
This trade was at first, I am told, chiefly
in the hands of the patterers: “Grand novelty!”
they said; “splendid engraving! The Lord’s
Prayer, with a beautiful picture of the Bible, all
legible to the naked eye, in the compass of a sixpence.
Five hundred letters, all clear, on a sixpence.”
One man said to me: “I knew very
well there wasn’t 500, but it was a neat number
to cry. A schoolmaster said to me once&mdash;‘Why,
there isn’t above half that number of letters.’ He
was wrong though; for I believe there’s 280.”
This card was published six or seven years ago,
and the success attending the sale of the Lord’s
Prayer, led to the publication of the Belief in the
same form. “When the trade was new,” said
one man, “I could sell a gross in a day without
any very great trouble; but in a little time there
was hundreds in the trade, and one might patter
hard to sell four dozen.”</p>

<p>The wholesale price was 8<i>s.</i> the gross, and as
thirteen cards went to the dozen, the day’s profit
when a gross was sold was 5<i>s.</i> When the sale
did not extend to beyond four dozen the profit was
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> A few cards “in letters of gold” were
vended in the streets at 6<i>d.</i> each. They had
large margins and presented a handsome appearance.
The wholesale price was 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen.</p>

<p>When this trade was at its height, there were,
I am told, from 500 to 700 men, women and
children engaged in it; selling the cards both
with and without other articles. The cards had
also a very extensive sale in the country.</p>

<p><i>Pen-holders with glass or china handles</i> are another
commodity which appeared suddenly, about
six months ago, in street commerce, and at once became
the staple of a considerable traffic. These pens
are eight or nine inches long, the “body,” so to
speak, being of solid round glass, of almost all
colours, green, blue, and black predominating, with
a seal (lacquered white or yellow) at the top, and a
holder of the usual kind, with a steel pen at the
bottom. Some are made of white pot and called
“China pens,” and of these some are ornamented
with small paintings of flowers and leaves. These
wares are German, and were first charged 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the gross, without pens, which were an additional
3<i>d.</i> at the swag-shops. The price is now 5<i>s.</i> the
gross, the pens being the same. The street-sellers
who were fortunate enough to “get a good
start” with these articles did exceedingly well.
The pen-holders, when new, are handsome-looking,
and at 1<i>d.</i> each were cheap; some few were at
first retailed at 2<i>d.</i> One man, I am told, sold
two-and-a-half gross in one day in the neighbourhood
of the Bank, purchasers not seldom taking
a dozen or more. As the demand continued,
some men connected with the supply of goods for
street sale, purchased all the stock in the swag-shops,
expending about 170<i>l.</i>, and at once raised
the price to 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the gross. This amount the
poorer street-sellers demurred to give, as they
could rarely obtain a higher price than 1<i>d.</i> each,
and 2<i>d.</i> for the ornamented holders, but the street-stationers
(who bought, however, very sparingly)
and the small shopkeepers gave the advance “as
they found the glass-holders asked for.” On the
whole, I am told, this forestalling was not very
profitable to the speculators, as when fresh supplies
were received at the “swags,” the price fell.</p>

<p>At first this street business was carried on by
men, but it was soon resorted to by numbers of
poor women and children. One gentleman informed
me that in consequence of reading “London
Labour and the London Poor,” he usually
had a little talk with the street-sellers of whom he
purchased any trifle; he bought these pen-holders
of ten or twelve different women and girls; all of
them could answer correctly his inquiry as to the
uses of the pens; but only one girl, of fifteen or
sixteen, and she hesitatingly, ventured to assert
that she could write her own name with the pen
she offered for sale. The street-trade still continues,
but instead of being in the hands of 400
individuals&mdash;as it was, at the very least, I am
assured, at one period&mdash;there are now only about
fifty carrying it on itinerantly, while with the
“pitched” sales-people, the glass-holders are
merely a portion of the stock, and with the itinerants
ten dozen a week (a receipt of 10<i>s.</i>, and a
profit of 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>) is now an average sale. The
former glass-holder sellers of the poorer sort are
now vending oranges.</p>

<p><i>Shirt Buttons</i> form another of the articles&mdash;(generally
either “useful things” or with such
recommendation to street-buyers as the galvanic
amulets possessed)&mdash;which every now and then
are disposed of in great quantities in the streets.
If an attempt be made by a manufacturer to establish
a cheaper shirt button, for instance, of
horn, or pot, or glass, and if it prove unsuccessful,
or if an improvement be effected and the old stock
becomes a sort of dead stock, the superseded goods
have to be disposed of, and I am informed by a
person familiar with those establishments, that
the swag-shopkeepers can always find customers,
“for anything likely,” with the indispensable
proviso that it be cheap. In this way shirt buttons
have lately been sold in the streets, not only
by the vendors of small wares in their regular
trade, but by men, lads, and girls, some of the
males shirtless themselves, who sell them solely,
with a continuous and monotonous cry of “Halfpenny
a dozen; halfpenny a dozen.” The wholesale
price of the last “street lot,” was 3<i>d.</i> the
gross, or &frac14;<i>d.</i> the dozen. To clear 6<i>d.</i> a day in
shirt buttons is “good work;” it is more frequently
4<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Walking-Sticks.</span></h3>

<p>The walking-sticks sold in the streets of London
are principally purchased at wholesale houses in
Mint-street and Union-street, Borough, and their
neighbourhoods. “There’s no street-trade,” said
an intelligent man, “and I’ve tried most that’s
been, or promised to be, a living in the streets,
that is so tiresome as the walking-stick trade.
There is nothing in which people are so particular.
The stick’s sure to be either too short or too long,
or too thick or too thin, or too limp or too stiff.
You would think it was a simple thing for a man
to choose a stick out of a lot, but if you were with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
me a selling on a fine Sunday at Battersea Fields,
you’d see it wasn’t. O, it’s a tiresome job.”</p>

<p>The trade is a summer and a Sunday trade.
The best localities are the several parks, and the
approaches to them, Greenwich-park included;
Hampstead Heath, Kennington Common, and,
indeed, wherever persons congregate for pedestrian
purposes, Battersea Fields being, perhaps, the
place where the greatest Sunday trade is carried
on. Some of the greater thoroughfares too, such
as Oxford-street and the City-road, are a good
deal frequented by the stick-sellers.</p>

<p>This trade&mdash;like others where the article sold
is not of general consumption or primary usefulness&mdash;affords,
what I once heard a street-seller
call, “a good range.” There is no generally recognised
price or value, so that a smart trader in
sticks can apportion his offers, or his charges, to
what he may think to be the extent of endurance
in a customer. What might be 2<i>d.</i> to a man who
“looked knowing,” might be 6<i>d.</i> to a man who
“looked green.” The common sticks, which are
the “cripples,” I was told, of all the sorts of
sticks (the spoiled or inferior sticks) mixed with
“common pines,” are 15<i>d.</i> the dozen. From this
price there is a gradual scale up to 8<i>s.</i> the dozen
for “good polished;” beyond that price the street-seller
rarely ventures, and seldom buys even at
that (for street-trade) high rate, as fourpenny and
sixpenny sticks go off the best; these saleable
sticks are generally polished hazel or pine. “I’ve
sold to all sorts of people, sir,” said a stick-seller.
“I once had some very pretty sticks, very cheap,
only 2<i>d.</i> a piece, and I sold a good many to boys.
They bought them, I suppose, to look like men,
and daren’t carry them home; for I once saw a
boy I’d sold a stick to, break it and throw it
away just before he knocked at the door of a respectable
house one Sunday evening. I’ve sold
shilling sticks to gentlemen, sometimes, that had
lost or broken or forgot their own. Canes there’s
nothing done in now in the streets; nor in ‘vines,’
which is the little switchy things that used to be
a sort of a plaything. There’s only one stick-man
in the streets, as far as I know, I think&mdash;that has
what you may call a capital in sticks. Only the
other day I saw him sell a registered stick near
Charing-cross. It was a beauty. A Bath cane,
with a splendid ivory head, and a compass let
into the ivory. The head screwed off, and beneath
was a map of London and a Guide to the
Great Exhibition. O, but he has a beautiful
stock, and aint he aristocratic! ‘Ash twigs,’
with the light-coloured bark on them, not polished,
but just trimmed, was a very good sale, but
they’re not now. Why, as to what I take, it’s
such a uncertain trade that it’s hard to say. Some
days I haven’t taken 6<i>d.</i>, and the most money
I ever took was one Derby day at Epsom&mdash;I
wish there was more Derby days, for poor
people’s sakes&mdash;and then I took 30<i>s.</i> The
most money as ever I took in London was 14<i>s.</i>&mdash;one
Sunday, in Battersea Fields, when I had
a prime cheap stock of bamboos. When I keep
entirely to the stick trade, and during the summer,
I may take 35<i>s.</i> in a week, with a profit
of 15<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>The street stick-sellers are, I am assured, sometimes
about 200 in number, on a fine Sunday in
the summer. Of these, some are dock-labourers,
who thus add to their daily earnings by a seventh
day’s labour; others, and a smarter class, are the
“supers” (supernumeraries) of theatres, who also
eke out their pittance by Sunday toil; porters,
irregularly employed, and consequently “hard
pushed to live,” also sell walking-sticks on the
Sundays; as do others who “cannot afford”&mdash;as
a well-educated man, a patterer on paper, once
said to me&mdash;“to lose a day if they were d&mdash;&mdash;d
for it.” The usual mode of this street-trade is
to carry the bundle of sticks strapped together,
under the arm, and deposit the ends on the ground
when a sale is to be effected. A few, however,
and principally Jews, have “stands,” with the
walking-sticks inclosed in a sort of frame. On
the Mondays there are not above a third of the
number of stick-sellers there are on the Sundays;
and on the other days of the week not above a
seventh, or an eighth. Calculating that for 12
weeks of the year there are every day 35 stick-sellers,
each taking, on an average, 30<i>s.</i> a week
(with a profit, individually, of about 12<i>s.</i>), we find
630<i>l.</i> expended in walking-sticks in the streets.</p>

<p>On clear winter days a stick-seller occasionally
plies his trade, but on frosty days they are occupied
in letting out skates in the parks, or wherever
ponds are frozen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Whips, etc.</span></h3>

<p>These traders are a distinct class from the
stick-sellers, and have a distinct class of customers.
The sale is considerable; for to many the possession
of a whip is a matter of importance. If one
be lost or stolen, for instance, from a butcher’s
cart at Newgate-market, the need of a whip to
proceed with the cart and horse to its destination,
prompts the purchase in the quickest manner,
and this is usually effected of the street-seller who
offers his wares to the carters at every established
resort.</p>

<p>The commonest of the whips sold to cart-drivers
is sometimes represented as whalebone covered
with gut; but the whalebone is a stick, and the
flexible part is a piece of leather, while the gut is
a sort of canvas, made to resemble the worked gut
of the better sort of whips, and is pasted to the
stock; the thong&mdash;which in the common sort is
called “four strands,” or plaits&mdash;being attached to
the flexible part. Some of these whips are old
stocks recovered, and many are sad rubbish; but
for any deceit the street-seller can hardly be considered
responsible, as he always purchases at the
shop of a wholesale whipmaker, who is in some
cases a retailer at the same price and under the
same representations as the street-seller. The
retail price is 1<i>s.</i> each; the wholesale, 8<i>s.</i> and 9<i>s.</i>
a dozen. Some of the street whip-sellers represent
themselves as the makers, but the whips are
almost all made in Birmingham and Walsall.</p>

way or other connected with the care of horses,
and some were described to me as “beaten-out
countrymen,” who had come up to town in the
hope of obtaining employment, and had failed.
One man, of the last-mentioned class, told me
that he had come to London from a village in
Cambridgeshire, bringing with him testimonials of
good character, and some letters from parties
whose recommendation he expected would be serviceable
to him; but he had in vain endeavoured
for some months to obtain work with a carrier,
omnibus proprietor, or job-master, either as driver
or in charge of horses. His prospects thus failing
him, he was now selling whips to earn his
livelihood. A friend advised him to do this, as
better than starving, and as being a trade that he
<span class="lock">understood:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I often thought I’d be forced to go back home,
sir,” he said, “and I’d have been ashamed to do ’t,
for I <i>would</i> come to try my luck in London, and
would leave a place I had. All my friends&mdash;and
they’re not badly off&mdash;tried to ’suade me to stop
at home another year or two, but come I would,
as if I must and couldn’t help it. I brought good
clothes with me, and they’re a’most all gone; and
I’d be ashamed to go back so shabby, like the
prodigal’s son; you know, sir. I’ll have another
try yet, for I get on to a cab next Monday, with
a very respectable cab-master. As I’ve only myself,
I know I can do. I was on one, but not
with the same master, after I’d been six weeks
here; but in two days I was forced to give it up,
for I didn’t know my way enough, and I didn’t
know the distances, and couldn’t make the money
I paid for my cab. If I asked another cabman,
he was as likely to tell me wrong as right. Then
the fares used to be shouting out, ‘I say, cabby,
where the h&mdash;&mdash; are you going? I told you
Mark-lane, and here we are at the Minories.
Drive back, sir.’ I know my way now well
enough, sir. I’ve walked the streets too long not
to know it. I notice them on purpose now, and
know the distances. I’ve written home for a
few things for my new trade, and I’m sure to get
them. They don’t know I’m selling whips. There
would be such a laugh against me among all
t’ young fellows if they did. Me as was so sure
to do well in London!</p>

<p>“It’s a poor trade. A carman’ll bid me 6<i>d.</i>
for such a whip as this, which is 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> the half
dozen wholesale. ‘I have to find my own whips,’
my last customer said, ‘though I drives for a
stunning grocer, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to him.’   They’re
great swearers some of them. I make 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> in
a week, for I can walk all day without tiring. I
one week cleared 14<i>s.</i> Next week I made 3<i>s.</i>
I <i>have</i> slept in cheap lodging-houses&mdash;but only
in three: one was very decent, though out
of the way; one was middling; and the
t’other was a pig-sty. I’ve seen very poor places
in the country, but nothing to it. I now pay 2<i>s.</i>
a week for a sort of closet, with a bed in it, at
the top of a house, but it’s clean and sweet; and
my landlord’s a greengrocer and coal-merchant
and firewood-seller;&mdash;he’s a good man&mdash;and I can
always earn a little against the rent with him, by
cleaning his harness, and grooming his pony&mdash;he
calls it a pony, but it’s over 15 hands&mdash;and
greasing his cart-wheels, and mucking out his
stable, and such like. I shall live there when
I’m on my cab.”</p>

<p>Other carmen’s whips are 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and as high
as 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but the great sale is of those at 1<i>s</i>.
The principal localities for the trade are at the
meat-markets, the “green markets,” Smithfield,
the streets leading to Billingsgate when crowded
in the morning, the neighbourhood of the docks
and wharfs, and the thoroughfares generally.</p>

<p>The trade in the other kind of whips is again
in the hands of another class, in that of cabmen
who have lost their licence, who have been
maimed, and the numerous “hands” who job
about stables&mdash;especially cab-horse stables&mdash;when
without other employment. The price of the
inferior sort of “gig-whips” is 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, the
wholesale price being from 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
dozen. Some are lower than 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but the
cabmen, I am told, “will hardly look at them;
they know what they’re a-buying of, and is wide
awake, and that’s one reason why the profit’s so
small.” Occasionally, one whip-seller told me, he
had sold gig-whips at 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to gentlemen
who had broken their “valuable lance-wood,” or
“beautiful thorn,” and who made a temporary
purchase until they could buy at their accustomed
shops. “A military gent, with mustachers, once
called to me in Piccadilly,” the same man stated,
“and he said, ‘Here, give me the best you can
for half-a-crown, I’ve snapped my own. I never
use the whip when I drive, for my horse is
skittish and won’t stand it, but I can’t drive
without one.’”</p>

<p>In the height of the season, two, and sometimes
three men, sell handsome gig-whips at the
fashionable drives or the approaches. “I have
taken as much as 30<i>s.</i> in a day, for three whips,”
said one man, “each 10<i>s.</i>; but they were silver-mounted
thorn, and very cheap indeed; that’s
8 or 9 years back; people looks oftener at 10<i>s.</i> now.
I’ve sold horse-dealers’ whips too, with loaded
ends. Oh, all prices. I’ve bought them, wholesale,
at 8<i>s.</i> a dozen, and 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a piece. Hunting
whips are never sold in the streets now. I have
sold them, but it’s a good while ago, as riding
whips for park gentlemen. The stocks were of fine
strong lancewood&mdash;such a close grain! with buck
horn handles, and a close-worked thong, fastened
to the stock by an ‘eye’ (loop), which it’s slipped
through. You could hear its crack half a mile
off. ‘Threshing machines,’ I called them.”</p>

<p>All the whip-sellers in a large way visit the
races, fairs, and large markets within 50 miles
of London. Some go as far as Goodwood at the
race-time, which is between 60 and 70 miles distant.
On a well-thronged race-ground these men
will take 3<i>l.</i> or 4<i>l.</i> in a day, and from a half to
three-fourths as much at a country fair. They
sell riding-whips in the country, but seldom in
town.</p>

<p>An experienced man knew 40 whip-sellers, as
nearly as he could call them to mind, by sight,
and 20 by name. He was certain that on no day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
were there fewer than 30 in the streets, and sometimes&mdash;though
rarely&mdash;there were 100. The most
prosperous of the body, including their profits at
races, &amp;c., make 1<i>l.</i> a week the year through; the
poorer sort from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>, and the latter are three
times as numerous as the others. Averaging that
only 30 whip-sellers take 25<i>s.</i> each weekly (with
profits of from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>) in London alone, we
find 1,950<i>l.</i> expended in the streets in whips.</p>

<p>Some of the whip-sellers vend whipcord, also,
to those cabmen and carters who “cord” their
own whips. The whipcord is bought wholesale
at 2<i>s.</i> the pound (sometimes lower), and sold at
&frac12;<i>d.</i> the knot, there being generally six dozen
knots in a pound.</p>

<p>Another class “mend” cabmen’s whips, re-thonging,
or “new-springing” them, but these are
street-artisans.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Pipes, and of
Snuff and Tobacco Boxes.</span></h3>

<p>The pipes now sold in the streets and public-houses
are the “china bowls” and the “comic
heads.” The “china-bowl” pipe has a bowl of
white stone china, which unscrews, from a flexible
tube or “stem,” as it is sometimes called, about
a foot long, with an imitation-amber mouth-piece.
They are retailed at 6<i>d.</i> each, and cost 4<i>s.</i> a
dozen at the swag-shops. The “comic heads” are
of the clay ordinarily used in the making of pipes,
and cost 16<i>d.</i> the dozen, or 15<i>s.</i> the gross.
They are usually retailed at 2<i>d.</i> Some of the
“comic heads” may be considered as hardly
well described by the name, as among them
are death’s-heads and faces of grinning devils.
“The best sale of the comic heads,” said one
man, “was when the Duke put the soldiers’
pipes out at the barracks; wouldn’t allow them
to smoke there. It was a Wellington’s head
with his thumb to his nose, taking a sight, you
know, sir. They went off capital. Lots of
people that liked their pipe bought ’em, in the
public-houses especial, ’cause, as I heerd one man&mdash;he
was a boot-closer&mdash;say, ‘it made the old boy
a-ridiculing of hisself.’ At that time&mdash;well, really,
then, I can’t say how long it’s since&mdash;I sold little
bone ‘tobacco-stoppers’&mdash;they’re seldom asked for
now, stoppers is quite out of fashion&mdash;and one of
them was a figure of ‘old Nosey,’ the Duke you
know&mdash;it was intended as a joke, you see, sir;
a tobacco-<i>stopper</i>.”</p>

<p>There are now nine men selling pipes, which they
frequently raffle at the public-houses; it is not unusual
for four persons to raffle at &frac12;<i>d.</i> each, for a
“comic head.” The most costly pipes are not now
offered in the streets, but a few are sold on race-courses.
I am informed that none of the pipe-sellers
depend entirely upon their traffic in those
wares, but occasionally sell (and raffle) such things
as china ornaments or table-covers, or tobacco or
snuff-boxes. If, therefore, we calculate that four
persons sell pipes daily the year through, taking
each 25<i>s.</i> (and clearing 10<i>s.</i>), we find 260<i>l.</i> yearly
expended upon the hawkers’ pipes.</p>

<p>The snuff and tobacco-boxes disposed of by
street-traders, for they are usually sold by the
same individual, are bought at the swag-shops. In
a matter of traffic, such as snuff-boxes, in which
the “fancy” (or taste) of the purchaser is freely
exercised, there are of course many varieties.
The exterior of some presents a series of transverse
lines, coloured, and looking neat enough.
Others have a staring portrait of the Queen, or of
“a young lady,” or a brigand, or a man inhaling
the pungent dust with evident delight; occasionally
the adornment is a ruin, a farm-house, or a
hunting scene. The retail price is from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>,
and the wholesale 3<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen. The
Scotch boxes, called “Holyroods” in the trade,
are also sold in the streets and public-houses.
These are generally the “self-colour” of the wood;
the better sort are lined with horn, and are, or
should be, remarkable for the closeness and nice
adjustment of the hinges or joints. They are sold&mdash;some
I was told being German-made&mdash;at the
swag-shops at 3<i>s.</i> the dozen, or 4<i>d.</i> each, to 6<i>s.</i> the
dozen, or 8<i>d.</i> each. “Why, I calc’lated,” said
one box-seller, “that one week when I was short
of tin, and had to buy single boxes, or twos, at a
time, to keep up a fair show of stock, the swags
got 2<i>s.</i> more out of me than if I could have gone
and bought by the dozen. I once ventured to buy
a very fine Holyrood; it’ll take a man three
hours to find out the way to open it, if he doesn’t
know the trick, the joints is so contrived. But I
have it yet. I never could get an offer for what
it cost me, 5<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>The tobacco-boxes are of brass and iron (though
often called “steel”). There are three sizes: the
“quarter-ounce,” costing 3<i>s.</i> the dozen; the “half-ounce,”
4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; and “the ounce,” 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen,
or 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> each. These are the prices of the
brass. The iron, which are “sized” in the same
way, are from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, wholesale.
They are retailed at from 3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> each, the brass
being retailed at from 4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> All these boxes
are opened and shut by pressure on a spring; they
are partly flat (but rounded), so as to fit in any
pocket. The cigar-cases are of the same quality as
the snuff-boxes (not the Holyroods), and cost, at
the German swag-shops, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen, or 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>
each. They are usually retailed, or raffled for on
Saturday and Monday nights, at 6<i>d.</i> each, but the
trade is a small one.</p>

<p>One branch of this trade, concerning which I
heard many street-sellers very freely express their
opinions, is the sale of “indecent snuff-boxes.”
Most of these traders insisted, with a not unnatural
bitterness, that it would be as easy to stop
the traffic as it was to stop Sunday selling in the
park, but then “gentlemen was accommodated
by it,” they added. These boxes and cigar-cases
are, for the most part, I am told, French, the
lowest price being 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a box. One man, whose
information was confirmed to me by others, gave
me the following account of what had come within
his own <span class="lock">knowledge:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There’s eight and sometimes nine persons carrying
on the indecent trade in snuff-boxes and cigar-cases.
They make a good bit of money, but
they’re drunken characters, and often hard up.
They’ve neither shame nor decency; they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
tempt lads or anybody. They go to public-houses
which they know is used by fast gents that has
money to spare. And they watch old and very
young gents in the streets, or any gents indeed,
and when they see them loitering and looking
after the girls, they take an opportunity to offer a
‘spicy snuff-box, very cheap.’ It’s a trade only
among rich people, for I believe the indecent sellers
can’t afford to sell at all under 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and they ask
high prices when they get hold of a green ’un; perhaps
one up on a spree from Oxford or Cambridge.
Well, I can’t say where they get their goods,
nor at what price. That’s their secret. They
carry them in a box, with proper snuff-boxes to be
seen when its opened, and the others in a secret
drawer beneath; or in their pockets. You may
have seen a stylish shop in Oxford-street, and in
the big window is large pipe heads of a fine
quality, and on them is painted, quite beautiful,
naked figures of women, and there’s snuff-boxes
and cigar-cases of much the same sort, but they’re
nothing to what these men sell. I must know, for
it’s not very long since I was forced, through
distress, to colour a lot of the figures. I could
colour 50 a day. I hadn’t a week’s work at it.
I don’t know what they make; perhaps twice as
much in a day, as in the regular trade can be
made in a week. I was told by one of them that
one race day he took 15<i>l.</i> It’s not every day
they do a good business, for sometimes they may
hawk without ever showing their boxes; but gentlemen
will have them if they pay ever so much
for them. There’s a risk in the trade, certainly.
Sometimes the police gets hold of them, but very
very seldom, and it’s 3 months. Or if the Vice
Society takes it up, it may be 12 months. The
two as does best in the trade are women; they
carry great lots. They’ve never been apprehended,
and they’ve been in the trade for years. No, I
should say they was not women of the town.
They’re both living with men, but the men’s not
in the same trade, and I think is in no trade;
just fancy men. So I’ve understood.”</p>

<p>I may observe that the generality of the hawkers
of indecent prints and cards are women.</p>

<p>There are about 35 persons selling snuff and
tobacco-boxes&mdash;the greatest sale being of tobacco-boxes&mdash;and
cigar-cases, generally with the other
things I have mentioned. Of these 35, however,
not one-half sell snuff-boxes constantly, but resort
to any traffic of temporary interest in the public
or street-public estimation. Some sell only in the
evenings. Reckoning that 15 persons on snuff

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Cigars.</span></h3>

<p>Cigars, I am informed, have constituted a portion
of the street-trade for upwards of 20 years,
having been introduced not long after the removal
of the prohibition on their importation
from Cuba. It was not, however, until five or six
years later that they were at all extensively sold
in the streets; but the street-trade in cigars is
no longer extensive, and in some respects has
ceased to exist altogether.</p>

<p>I am told by experienced persons that the cigars
first vended in the streets and public-houses were
really smuggled. I say “really” smuggled, as
many now vended under that pretence never came
from the smuggler’s hands. “Well, now, sir,” said
one man, “the last time I sold Pickwicks and
Cubers a penny apiece with lights for nothing,
was at Greenwich Fair, on the sly rather, and
them as I could make believe was buying a
smuggled thing, bought far freer. Everybody likes
a smuggled thing.” [This remark is only in consonance
with what I have heard from others of
the same class.] “In my time I’ve sold what was
smuggled, or made to appear as sich, but far more
in the country than town, to all sorts&mdash;to gentlemen,
and ladies, and shopkeepers, and parsons, and
doctors, and lawyers. Why no, sir, I can’t say
as how I ever sold anything in that way to an
exciseman. But smuggling’ll always be liked;
it’s sich a satisfaction to any man to think he’s
done the tax-gatherer.”</p>

<p>The price of a cigar, in the earlier stages of the
street-traffic, was 2<i>d.</i> and 3<i>d.</i> One of the boxes
in which these wares are ordinarily packed was
divided by a partition, the one side containing the
higher, and the other the lower priced article.
The division was often a mere trick of trade&mdash;in
justification of which any street-seller would be
sure to cite the precedent of shopkeepers’ practices&mdash;for
the cigars might be the same price
(wholesale) but the bigger and better-looking were
selected as “threepennies,” the “werry choicest
and realest Hawanners, as mild as milk, and as
strong as gunpowder,” for such, I am told, was
the cry of a then well-known street-trader. The
great sale was of the “twopennies.” As the
fuzees, now so common, were unknown, and lucifer
matches were higher-priced, and much inferior
to what they are at present, the cigar seller in
most instances carried tow with him, a portion of
which he kept ignited in a sort of tinder-box, and
at this the smokers lighted their cigars; or the
vender twisted together a little tow and handed
it, ignited, to a customer, that if he were walking
on he might renew his “light,” if the cigar
“wouldn’t draw.”</p>

<p>A cheaper cigar soon found its way into street
commerce, “only a penny apiece, prime cigars;”
and on its first introduction, a straw was fitted
into it, as a mouth-piece. “Cigar tubes” were
also sold in the streets; they were generally of
bone, and charged from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> each. The cigar
was fitted into the tube, and they were strongly
recommended on the score of economy, as “by
means of this tube, any gen’l’man can smoke his
cigar to half a quarter of an inch, instead of being
forced to throw it away with an inch and a half
left.” These tubes have not for a long time been
vended in the streets. I am told by a person,
who himself was then engaged in the sale, that
the greatest number of penny cigars ever sold in
the streets in one day was on that of her Majesty’s
coronation (June 28, 1838). Of this he was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
positive from what he had experienced, seen, and
heard.</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” said another street-seller,
“the greatest injury the street-trade in such things
had was when the publicans took to selling cigars.
They didn’t at first, at least not generally; I’ve
sold cigars myself, at the bars of respectable houses,
to gentlemen that was having their glass of ale
with a friend, and one has said to another, ‘Come,
we’ll have a smoke,’ and has bought a couple.
O, no; I never was admitted to offer them in a
parlour or tap-room; that would have interfered
with the order for ‘screws’ (penny papers of
tobacco), which is a rattling good profit, I can tell
you. Indeed, I was looked shy at, from behind
the bar; but if customers chose to buy, a landlord
could hardly interfere. Now, it’s no go at all
in such places.”</p>

<p>One common practice among the smarter street-seller,
when “on cigars,” was, until of late years,
and still is, occasionally at races and fairs, to
possess themselves of a few really choice “weeds,”
as like as they could procure them to their stock-in-trade,
and to smoke one of them, as they urged
their traffic.</p>

<p>The aroma was full and delicate, and this was
appealed to if necessary, or, as one man worded
it, the smell was “left to speak for itself.” The
street-folk who prefer the sale of what is more or
less a luxury, become, by the mere necessities of
their calling, physiognomists and quick observers,
and I have no reason to doubt the assertion of one
cigar-vendor, when he declared that in the earlier
stages of this traffic he could always, and most
unerringly in the country, pick out the man
on whose judgment others seemed to rely, and by
selling him one of his choice reserve, procure a
really impartial opinion as to its excellence, and
so influence other purchasers. When the town
trade “grew stale”&mdash;the usual term for its falling-off&mdash;the
cigar-sellers had a remunerative field in
many parts of the country.</p>

<p>In London, before railways became the sole
means of locomotion to a distance, the cigar-sellers
frequented the coaching-yards; and the “outsides”
frequently “bought a cigar to warm their noses of a
cold night,” and sometimes filled their cases, if
the cigar-seller chanced to have the good word of
the coachman or guard.</p>

<p>The cigar street-trade was started by two Jews,
brothers, named Benasses, who were “licensed to
deal in tobacco,” and vended good articles. When
they relinquished the open-air business, they supplied
the other street-sellers, whose numbers increased
very rapidly. The itinerant cigar-vending
was always principally in the hands of the
Jews, but the general street-traders resorted to the
traffic on all occasions of public resort,&mdash;“sich
times,” observed one, “as fairs and races, and
crownations, and Queen’s weddings; I wish they
came a bit oftener for the sake of trade.” The
manufacture of the cigars sold at the lowest rates,
is now almost entirely in the hands of the Jews,
and I am informed by a distinguished member of
that ancient faith, that when I treat of the Hebrew
children, employed in <i>making</i> cigars, there
will be much to be detailed of which the public
have little cognisance and little suspicion.</p>

<p>The cigars in question are bought (wholesale)
in Petticoat-lane, Rosemary-lane, Ailie-street,
Tenter-ground, in Goodman’s-fields, and similar
localities. The kinds in chief demand are Pickwicks,
7<i>s.</i> and 8<i>s.</i> per lb.; Cubas, 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; common
Havannahs and Bengal Cheroots, the same price;
but the Bengal Cheroots are not uncommonly
smuggled.</p>

<p>“The best places for cigar-selling,” one man
stated, “I’ve always found to be out of town;
about Greenwich and Shooter’s Hill, and to the
gents going to Kensington Gardens, and such like
places. About the Eagle Tavern was good, too, as
well as the streets leading to the Surrey Zoological&mdash;one
could whisper, ‘cheap cigar, sir, half what
they’ll charge you inside.’ I’ve known young
women treat their young men to cigars as they
were going to Cremorne, or other public places;
but there’s next to no trade that way now, and
hasn’t been these five or six years. I don’t know
what stopped it exactly. I’ve heard it was shop-keepers
that had licences, complaining of street
people as hadn’t, and so the police stopped the
trade as much as they could.”</p>

<p>At all the neighbouring races and fairs, and at
any great gathering of people in town, cigars are
sold, more with the affectation than the reality of
its being done, “quite on the sly.” The retail
price is 1<i>d.</i> each, and three for 2<i>d.</i> Some of the
cheap cigars are made to run 200, and even as
high as 230 to the pound. A fuzee is often given
into the bargain.</p>

<p>I am told that, on all favourable opportunities,
there are still 100 persons who vend cigars in the
streets of London, while a greater number of
“London hands” carry on the trade at Epsom
and Ascot races. At other periods the business
is all but a nonentity. To clear 1<i>l.</i> a week is
considered “good work.” At one period, on
every fine Sunday, there were not, I am assured,
fewer than 500 persons selling cigars in the open
air in London and its suburbs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Sponge.</span></h3>

<p>This is one of the street-trades which has been
long in the hands of the Jews, and, unlike the
traffic in pencils, sealing-wax, and other articles
of which I have treated, it remains so principally
still.</p>

<p>In perhaps no article which is a regular branch
of the street-trade, is there a greater diversity in
the price and quality than in sponge. The street-sellers
buy it at 1<i>s.</i> (occasionally 6<i>d.</i>), and as high
as 21<i>s.</i> the pound. At one time, I believe about
20 years back, when fine sponge in large pieces
was scarce and dear, some street-sellers gave 28<i>s.</i>
the pound, or, in buying a smaller quantity, 2<i>s.</i>
an ounce.</p>

<p>“I have sold sponge of all sorts,” said an experienced
street-seller, “both ‘fine toilet,’ fit for
any lady or gentleman, and coarse stuff not fit to
groom a ass with. That very common sponge is
mostly 1<i>s.</i> the lb. wholesale, but it’s no manner of
use, it’s so sandy and gritty. It weighs heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
or there might be a better profit on it. It has to
be trimmed up and damped for showing it, and
then it always feels hask (harsh) to the hand.
It rubs to bits in no time. There was a old gent
what I served with sponges, and he was very
perticler, and the best customer I ever had, for
his housekeeper bought her leathers of me. Like
a deal of old coves that has nothing to do and
doesn’t often stir out, but hidles away time in
reading or pottering about a garden, he was fond
of a talk, and he’d give me a glass of something
short, as if to make me listen to him, for I used to
get fidgety, and he’d talk away stunning. He’s
dead now. He’s told me, and more nor once,
that sponges was more of a animal than a wegetable,”
continued the incredulous street-seller,
“I do believe people reads theirselves silly. Such
&mdash;&mdash; nonsense! Does it look like a animal?
Where’s its head and its nose? He’d better
have said it was a fish. And it’s not a wegetable
neither. But I’ll tell you what it is, sir,
and from them as has seen it where its got with
their own eyes. I have some relations as is sea-farin’-men,
and I went a woyage once myself when
a lad&mdash;one of my relations has seen it gathered by
divers, I forget where, from the rocks at the bottom
and shores of the sea, and he says it’s just sea-moss&mdash;stuff
as grows there, as moss does to old
walls in England. That’s what it is, sir. As
it’s grown in the water, it holds water you see.
I’ve made 15<i>s.</i> on sponge alone, in a good week,
when I had a good stock; but oftener I’ve made
only 10<i>s.</i>, and sometimes not 5<i>s.</i> My best trade
is at private houses a little ways out of town.
I’ve heard gents say, ‘A good sponging’s as good
as a bath,’ and when I could get good things cheap
they’d be sure to sell. No, I never did much
at the mews.”</p>

<p>Another man told me that he once bought a
large quantity of sponge at 6<i>d.</i> the lb., trimmed
it up as well as he could, and got a man to help
him, and the two “worked it off” in barrows;
there was six barrows full, and as one was
emptied it was replenished. It was sold at 1<i>d.</i>
and 2<i>d.</i> a lump; about twenty lumps, or pieces,
going to a pound, so that there was 14<i>d.</i> profit
on what cost 6<i>d.</i>, even on the penny
lumps. He had forgotten the exact amount he
cleared, and he and his mate sold it all in one
summer’s evening, but it was somewhere about 10<i>s.</i>
This happened some years ago, when the common
sponge, which I heard called also “honeycomb”
sponge, was not so “blown upon,” as my informant
expressed it, as it is now. On my asking
this man as to the proportion of Jews in this
trade, he answered: “Well, many a day I’m
satisfied there’s 100 people selling sponge, and I
should say that for every ten or twelve Jews is one
Christian, and half of them, or more, has been in
some sort of service, I mean the Christians has,
most likely stable-helpers, and they supplies the
mews and the job and livery stables, such of them
as requires men to find their own sponges, but
that’s only a few; sponges is mostly bought for
such places at the saddlers’ and other shops. In
my opinion, sir, Jews is better Christians than
Christians themselves, for <i>they</i> help one another,
and we don’t. I’ve been helped by a Jew myself,
without any connection with them. They’re
terrible keen hands at a bargain, though.”</p>

<p>The sponge in the street-trade is purchased,
wholesale, chiefly in Houndsditch. The wholesale
trade in sponge, I may add, is also in the hands
of the Jews. The great mart is Smyrna, the
best qualities being gathered in the islands of the
Greek Archipelago. The sponge is carried by
the street-traders in baskets, the bearer holding a
specimen piece or two in his hand. Smaller
pieces are sometimes carried in nets, and nets
were more frequently in use for this purpose than
at present. It is nearly all sold by itinerants, in
the business parts as well as the suburbs, the
purchasers being “shopkeepers, innkeepers, gentlemen,
and gentlemen’s servants.” Sometimes
low-priced sponge is offered in a street-market on
a Saturday or Monday night, but very rarely, as
it is a thing little used by the poor. A little is
sold to the cabmen at their stands. The sponge-sellers,
I may add, when going a regular round,
offer their wares to any passer-by. A little is
done by the Jews in bartering sponge for old
clothes. There are five or six women in the
trade.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that the estimate of my
informant, as to the number of sponge-sellers, is
correct. But some sell sponge only occasionally,
some make it only a portion of their business, and
others vend it only when they “have it a bargain.”
Calculating, then, that only fifty persons (so allowing
for the irregularities in the trade) vend
sponge daily, and that each takes 15<i>s.</i> weekly,&mdash;some
taking 25<i>s.</i>, and others but 5<i>s.</i>&mdash;with about
half profit on the whole (the common sponge
is often from 200 to 300 per cent. profit), we find
the outlay to be 1,950<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Wash-Leathers.</span></h3>

<p>The wash-leathers, sometimes called “shammys”
(chamois), now sold extensively in the streets, are
for the most part the half of a sheep-skin, or of
a larger lamb-skin. The skin is “split” by machinery,
and to a perfect nicety, into two portions.
That known as the “grain” (the part to which
the fleece of the animal is attached) is very thin,
and is dressed into a “skiver,” a kind of leather
used in the commoner requirements of book-binding,
and for such purposes as the lining of
hats. The other portion, the “flesh,” is dressed
as wash-leather. These skins are bought at the
leather-sellers and the leather-dressers, at from
2<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> the dozen. The higher priced, or
those from 12<i>s.</i> are often entire, and not “split”
skins. The great majority of the street-sellers
of wash-leathers are women, and principally
Irishwomen. They offer their wash-leathers in
all parts of town, calling at shops and inns;
and at private houses offering them through
the area rails, or knocking at the door when
it is accessible. Many of these street-sellers
are the wives of Irish labourers, employed by
bricklayers and others, who are either childless,
or able to leave their younger children under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
the care of an older brother or sister, or when the
poverty of the parents, or their culpable neglect,
is extreme, allow them to run at large in the
court or street, untended. The wives by this
street-trade add to the husbands’ earnings. In
the respects of honesty and chastity, these women
bear good characters.</p>

<p>The wash-leathers are sold for the cleaning of
windows, and of plate and metal goods. Sixpence
is a common price for a leather, the higher
priced being sold at the mews and at gentlemen’s
houses. The “chamois” sold at the mews,
however, are not often sold by the Irishwomen,
but by the class I have described as selling scissors,
&amp;c., there. The leathers are also cut into
pennyworths, and these pennyworths are sometimes
sold on Saturday evenings in the street-markets.</p>

<p>There are, I am assured, 100 individuals
selling little or nothing else but wash-leathers
(for these traders are found in all the suburbs) in
London, and that they take 10<i>s.</i> weekly, with a
profit of from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> There are, also, 100
other persons selling them occasionally, along with
other goods, and as they vend the higher-priced
articles, they probably receive nearly an equal
amount. Hence it would appear that upwards of
5000<i>l.</i> is annually expended in the streets in
this purchase.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Spectacles and
Eye-Glasses.</span></h3>

<p>Twenty-five years ago the street-trade in spectacles
was almost entirely in the hands of the
Jews, who hawked them in their boxes of jewellery,
and sold them in the streets and public-houses,
carrying them in their hands, as is done
still. The trade was then far more remunerative
than it is at the present time to the street-folk
carrying it on. “People had more money then,”
one old spectacle-seller, now vending sponges, said,
“and there wasn’t so many forced to take to the
streets, Irish particularly, and opticians’ charges
were higher than they are now, and those who
wanted glasses thought they were a take-in if
they wasn’t charged a fair price. O, times was
very different then.”</p>

<p>The spectacles in the street-trade are bought at
swag-shops in Houndsditch. The “common metal
frames,” with or without slides, are 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen wholesale, and are retailed from
4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> The “horn frames” are 6<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the dozen, and are retailed from 9<i>d.</i> to 18<i>d.</i>, and
even 2<i>s.</i> The “thin steel” are from 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
21<i>s.</i> the dozen, and are retailed from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>
There are higher and lower prices, but those I
have cited are what are usually paid by the street-traders.
The inequality of the retail prices is
accounted for by there being some difference in
the spectacles in a dozen, some being of a better-looking
material in horn or metal; others better
finished. Then there is the chance of which
street-sellers are not slow to avail themselves&mdash;(“no
more nor is shopkeepers,” one man said)&mdash;I
mean, the chance of obtaining an enhanced
price for an article, with whose precise value the
buyer is unacquainted.</p>

<p>“The patter,” said the street-trader I have
before quoted, “is nothing now, to what I’ve
known it. You call it patter, but I don’t. I
think it’s more in the way of persuasion, and
is mostly said in public-houses, and not in
the streets. Why, I’ve persuaded people, when
I was in the trade and doing well at it&mdash;for that
always gives you spirits&mdash;I’ve persuaded them
in spite of their eyes that they wanted glasses. I
knew a man who used to brag that he could talk
people blind, and then they bought! It wasn’t
old people I so much sold to as young and middle-aged.
I think perhaps I sold as many because
people thought they looked better, or more knowing
in them, than to help their eyesight. I’ve
known my customers try my glasses, one pair
after another, in the chimney glass of a public-house
parlour. ‘They’re real Scotch pebbles,’ I
used to say sometimes&mdash;and I always had a fair
article,&mdash;‘and was intended for a solid silver frame
but the frame was made too small for them, and
so I got them and put them into this frame myself,
for I’m an optician, out of work, by trade.
They’re worth 15<i>s.</i>, but you may have them,
framed and all, for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’ I got 5<i>s.</i> for one pair
once that way but they were a superior thing; I
had them a particular bargain.” One man told
me that not long ago he asked 10<i>d.</i> for a pair
of spectacles, and a journeyman slop-tailor said
to him, “Why I only gave 1<i>s.</i> for this pair I’m
wearing a few years back, and they ought to be
less than 10<i>d.</i> now, for the duty’s off glass.”</p>

<p>The eye-glasses sold in the streets are “framed”
in horn. They are bought at the same places as
the spectacles, and cost, wholesale, for “single
eyes” 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen. The retail
price is from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> The “double eyes,” which
are jointed in the middle so that the frame can be
fitted to the bridge of the nose, are 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
15<i>s.</i> the dozen, and are retailed by the street-folk
from 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>The spectacles are sold principally to working
men, and are rarely hawked in the suburbs. The
chief sale is in public-houses, but they are offered
in all the busier thoroughfares and wherever a
crowd is assembled. “The eye-glasses,” said a
man who vended them, “is sold to what I calls
counter-hoppers and black-legs. You’ll see most
of the young swells that’s mixed up with gaming
concerns at races&mdash;for there’s gaming still, though
the booths is put down in many places&mdash;sport
their eye-glasses; and so did them as used to be
concerned in getting up Derby and St. Leger
‘sweeps’ at public-houses; least-ways I’ve sold
to them, where sweeps was held, and they was
busy about them, and offered me a chance, sometimes,
for a handsome eye-glass. But they’re going
out of fashion, is eye-glasses, I think. The other
day I stood and offered them for nearly five hours
at the foot of London-bridge, which used to be a
tidy pitch for them, and I couldn’t sell one. All
that day I didn’t take a halfpenny.”</p>

<p>There are sometimes 100 men, the half of
whom are Jews and Irishmen in equal propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>tions,
now selling spectacles and eye-glasses. Some
of these traders are feeble from age, accident,
continued sickness, or constitution, and represent
that they must carry on a “light trade,” being
incapable of hard work, even if they could get it.
Two women sell spectacles along with Dutch
drops. As in other “light trades,” the spectacle
sellers do not, as a body, confine themselves to
those wares, but resort, as one told me, “to anything
that’s up at the time and promises better,”
for a love of change is common among those who
pursue a street life. It may be estimated, I am
assured, that there are thirty-five men (so allowing
for the breaks in regular spectacle selling) who
vend them daily, taking 15<i>s.</i> a week (with a
profit of 10<i>s.</i>), the yearly expenditure being thus
1365<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Dolls.</span></h3>

<p>The making of dolls, like that of many a thing
required for a mere recreation, a toy, a pastime, is
often carried on amidst squalor, wretchedness, or
privation, or&mdash;to use the word I have frequently
heard among the poor&mdash;“pinching.” Of this matter,
however, I shall have to treat when I proceed to
consider the manufacture of and trade in dolls
generally, not merely as respects street-sale.</p>

<p>Dolls are now so cheap, and so generally sold
by open-air traders whose wares are of a miscellaneous
character, as among the “swag-barrow”
or “penny-a piece” men of whom I have treated
separately, that the sale of what are among the
most ancient of all toys, as a “business of itself,”
is far smaller, numerically, than it was.</p>

<p>The dolls are most usually carried in baskets
by street-sellers (who are not makers) and generally
by women who are very poor. Here and
there in the streets most frequented by the patrons
of the open-air trade may be seen a handsome
stall of dolls of all sizes and fashions, but these
are generally the property of makers, although
those makers may buy a portion of their stock.
There are also smaller stalls which may present
the stock of the mere seller.</p>

<p>The dolls for street traffic may be bought at
the swag-shops or of the makers. For the little
armless 1<i>d.</i> dolls the maker charges the street-seller
8<i>s.</i>, and to the swag-shop keeper who may buy
largely, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen. Some little stalls are
composed entirely of penny dolls; on others the
prices run from 1<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> The chief trade, however,
among the class I now describe, is carried on
by the display of dolls in baskets. If the vendor
can only attract the notice of children&mdash;and more
especially in a private suburban residence, where
children are not used to the sight of dolls on stalls
or barrows, or in shops&mdash;and can shower a few
blessings and compliments, “God be wid your
bhutiful faces thin&mdash;and yours too, my lady,
ma’am (with a curtsey to mistress or maid). Buy
one of these dolls of a poor woman: shure they’re
bhutiful dolls and shuted for them angels o’ the
worruld;” under such circumstances, I say, a sale
is almost certain. I may add that the words I
have given I myself heard a poor Irishwoman,
whom I had seen before selling large pincushions
in the same neighbourhood (that of the Regent’s
Park), address to a lady who was walking round
her garden accompanied by two children.</p>

<p>A vendor of dolls expresses an opinion that as
long as ever there are children from two years old
to ten, there will always be purchasers of dolls;
“but for all that,” said he, “somehow or another
’t is nothing of a trade to what it used to be. I’ve
seen the time when I could turn out in the morning
and earn a pound afore night; but it’s different
now there’s so many bazaars, and so many
toy shops that the doll hawker hasn’t half the
chance he used to have. Sartinly we gets a
chance now and then&mdash;fine days is the best&mdash;and
if we can get into the squares or where the
children walks with their nurses, we can do tidy;
but the police are so very particular there’s not
much of a livelihood to be got. Spoiled children
are our best customers. Whenever we sees a
likely customer approaching&mdash;we, that is, those
who know their business&mdash;always throw ourselves
in the way, and spread out our dolls to the best
advantage. If we hears young miss say <i>she will</i>
have one, and cries for it, we are almost sure of a
customer, and if we see her kick and fight a bit
with the nuss-maid we are sure of a good price.
If a child <i>cries well</i> we never baits our price.
Most of the doll-sellers are the manufacturers of
the dolls&mdash;that is, I mean, they puts ’em together.
The heads are made in Hamburgh; the principal
places for buying them in London are at Alfred
Davis’s, in Houndsditch; White’s, in Houndsditch;
and Joseph’s, in Leadenhall-street. They are sold
as thus:&mdash;The heads that we sell for 3<i>d.</i> each,
when made up, cost us 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per gross, or 7&frac12;<i>d.</i>
per dozen; these are called 1&mdash;O’s. No. 2&mdash;O’s.,
are 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per gross, and No. 3&mdash;O’s. 10<i>s.</i>
per gross. One yard and half of calico will make
a dozen bodies, small size. These we get sewn
for three halfpence, and we stuffs and finishes
them ourselves.</p>

<p>“When our 3<i>d.</i> dolls are made up, they cost
about 1<i>s.</i> per dozen&mdash;so there is 2<i>d.</i> profit on every
doll, which I thinks is little enough; but we
often sells ’em at 2<i>d.</i>; we lays ’em out to the
best advantage in a deep basket, all standing up,
as it were, or leaning against the sides of the
basket. The legs and bodies is carefully wrapped
in tissue paper, not exactly to preserve the lower
part of the doll, for that isn’t so very valuable,
but in reality to conceal the legs and body, which
is rather the reverse of symmetrical; for, to tell
the truth, every doll looks as if it were labouring
under an attack of the gout. There are, however,
some very neat articles exported from Germany,
especially the jointed dolls, but they are too dear
for the street-hawker, and would not show to such
advantage. There is also the plaster dolls, with
the match legs. I wonder how they keep their
stand, for they are very old-fashioned; but they
sell, for you never see a chandler’s shop window
without seeing one of these sticking in it, and a falling
down as if it was drunk. Then there’s the wax
dolls. Some of ’em are made of wax, and others
of ‘<i>pappy mashy</i>,’ and afterwards dipped in wax.
The cheapest and best mart for these is in Barbi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>can;
it would astonish many if they knew
exactly what was laid out in the course of a year
in dolls. It would be impossible, I think, to ascertain
exactly; but I think I could guess something
near the mark. There are, at least, at this time
of year, when the fairs are coming on, fifty doll-hawkers,
who sell nothing else. Say each of these
sells one dozen dolls per day, and that their average
price is 4<i>d.</i> each. That is just 10<i>l.</i> a day, and 60<i>l.</i>
per week. In the winter time so many are not
sold; but I have no doubt that 50<i>l.</i>’s worth of dolls
are sold each week throughout the year by London
hawkers alone, or just upon 3000<i>l.</i> per annum.
The shops sell as many as the hawkers, and the
stalls attending fairs half the amount; and you
may safely say that the sum taken for dolls in and
around London in one year amounts to 7500<i>l.</i>
A doll-merchant can begin business with a trifle,”
continued my informant; “a shilling will obtain
a dozen 3<i>d.</i> dolls. If you have no basket, carry
them in your arms, although they don’t show off
to such advantage there as they do when nicely
basketed; however, if you’ve luck, you may soon
raise a basket; for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> you can get a very
nice one; and although the doll trade is not what
it used to be, there are,” said my informant,
“worse games than that yet, I know. One man,
who is now in a very respectable way of business&mdash;‘<i>a
regular gentleman</i>’&mdash;was a very few years
ago only a doll-hawker. Another man, who had
two hands and only one arm&mdash;poor fellow! he
was born with one arm, and had two hands, one
appended to his arm in the usual way, and the
other attached to his shoulder&mdash;a freak of nature,
I think, they called it. However, my one-armed
friend keeps now a very respectable little swag-shop
at North Shields, in Northumberland.”</p>

<p>I inquired of my informant whether he objected
to relate a little of his history? He replied,
“not the least,” and recounted as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“They call me <i>Dick the Dollman</i>. I was, I
believe, the first as ever cried dolls three a shilling
in the streets. Afore I began they al’ays stood
still with ’em; but I cried ’em out same as they
do mackrel; that is twenty years ago. I wasn’t
originally a doll-seller. My father was a pensioner
in Greenwich College. My mother used to hawk,
and had a licence. I was put to school in St.
Patrick’s-school, Lanark’s-passage, where I remained
six years, but I didn’t learn much. At
thirteen years of age I was apprenticed to a brush
and broom maker’s, corner of C&mdash;&mdash; Street, Spitalfields.
My master was not the honestest chap
in the world, for he bought hair illegal, was found
out, and got transported for seven years. A man
who worked for my master took me to finish my
apprenticeship; this man and his wife was very
old people. I used to work four days in the
week, two for them and two for myself; the
other two days I went out hawking brooms and
brushes, and very often would earn 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> on a
Saturday, but times was better then than they are
now. Arter that, for sake of gain, I left the old
people, I was offered 20<i>s.</i> to make and hawk; and in
course I took it. I remained with this master five
months; he was afflicted with rheumatic fever&mdash;went
into the hospital&mdash;and I was left to shift for
myself. When my master went to the hospital I
had 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in my pocket; I knew I <i>must</i>
do something, and, to tell you the truth, I
didn’t like the brush-making; I would rather
have hawked something without the trouble of
making it. I think <i>now</i> I was a little afflicted
with laziness. I was passing London-bridge and
saw a man selling Marshall’s pocket-books; I
knowed him afore; I thought I should like to try
the pocket-book selling, and communicated my
wishes to the man; he told me they cost eight
shillings a dozen, if I liked we would purchase a
dozen a’twixt us; we did so; I received half a
dozen, but I afterwards learned that my friend
obtained seven for his share, as they were sold
thirteen to the dozen. I went to Chancery-lane
with my lot and was very lucky; I sold the six
books to one gentleman for six shillings: in course
I soon obtained another supply; that day I sold four
dozen, and earned 20<i>s.</i> I was such a good seller that
Marshall let me have 3<i>l.</i> or 4<i>l.</i>’s worth on credit&mdash;<i>and
I never paid him</i>. I know that was wrong now;
but I was such a foolish chap, and used to spend
my money as fast as I got it. I would have
given Marshall a shilling the other day if I had
had one, for I see him selling penny books in the
street. I thought it was hard lines, and had been
such a gentleman too. Somerset-house corner
was a capital stand for selling pocket-books. The
way I took to the dolls was this; I met a girl
with a doll basket one day as I was standing at
Somerset-house corner; she and I got a talking.
‘Will you go to the ’Delphy to night?’ says I; she
consented. They was a playing Tom and Jerry
at this time, all the street-sellers went to see it,
and other people; and nice and crabbed some on
’em was. Well, we goes to the ’Delphy&mdash;and I
sees her often arter that, and at last gets married.
She used to buy her dolls ready made; I soon
finds out where to get the heads&mdash;and the profits
when we made them ourselves was much greater.
We began to serve hawkers and shops; went to
Bristol&mdash;saved 47<i>l.</i>&mdash;comes to London and spends
it all; walks back to Bristol, and by the time we
got there we had cleared more than 20<i>l.</i> We
were about a month on the journey, and visited
Cheltenham and other towns. We used to spend
our money very foolishly; we were too fond of
what was called getting on the spree. You see
we might have done well if we had liked, but we
hadn’t the sense. My wife got very clever at the
dolls and so did I. Then I tried my hand at the
wax dolls, and got to make them very well. I
paid a guinea to learn.</p>

<p>“I was selling wax-dolls one day in London,
and a gentleman asked me if I could mend a wax
figure whose face was broken. I replied yes, for
I had made a few wax heads, large size, for some
showmen. I had made some murderers who was
hung; lately I made Rush and Mr. and Mrs.
Manning; but the showmen can’t afford to get
new heads now-a-days, so they generally makes
one head do for all; sometimes they changes the
dress. Well, as I was telling you, I went with
this gentleman, and proposed that he should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
a new head cast, for the face of the figure was so
much broken. It was Androcles pulling the
thorn out of the lion’s foot, and was to be exhibited.
I got 20<i>s.</i> for making the new head.
The gentleman asked me if I knew the story
about Androcles. Now I had never heard on him
afore, but I didn’t like to confess my ignorance,
so I says ‘yes;’ then he offers me 30<i>s.</i> a week to
describe it in the Flora Gardens, where it was to
be exhibited. I at once accepted the engagement;
but I was in a bit of a fix, for I didn’t know
what to say. I inquired of a good many people,
but none on ’em could tell me; at last I was
advised to go to Mr. Charles Sloman&mdash;you know
who I mean&mdash;him as makes a song and sings it
directly; I was told he writes things for people.
I went, and he wrote me out a patter. I asked
him how much he charged; he said, ‘Nothing my
man.’ Sartinly he wasn’t long a-doing it, but it
was very kind of him. I got what Mr. Sloman
wrote out for me printed, and this I stuck inside
my hat; the people couldn’t see it, though I dare
say they wondered what I was looking in my hat
about. However, in a week or so, I got it by
heart, and could speak it well enough. After exhibiting
Androcles I got an engagement with
another waxwork show&mdash;named Biancis&mdash;and
afterwards at other shows. I was considered a
very good doorsman in time, but there’s very little
to be got by that now; so we keeps to the dolly
business, and finds we can get a better living at
that than anything else. Me and the old woman
can earn 1<i>l.</i> a week, bad and all as things are;
but we’re obliged to hawk.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Swag-Barrowmen,” and “Lot-Sellers.”</span></h3>

<p>The “swag” (miscellaneous) barrow is one of
the objects in the streets which attracts, perhaps
more readily than any other, the regards of the
passer-by. There are so many articles and of such
various uses; they are often so closely packed, so
new and clean looking, and every here and there
so tastefully arranged, that this street-trader’s
barrow really repays an examination. Here are
spread on the flat part of the barrow, pepper-cruets
or boxes, tea-caddies, nutmeg-graters,
vinegar-cruets, pen-cases, glass or china-handled
pens, pot ornaments, beads, ear-rings, finger-rings
(plain or with “stones”), cases of scent-bottles,
dolls, needle-cases, pincushions, Exhibition medals
and “frames” (framed pictures), watches, shawl-pins,
extinguishers, trumpets and other toys,
kaleidoscopes, seals, combs, lockets, thimbles, bone
tooth-picks, small playing-cards, teetotums, shuttle-cocks,
key-rings, shirt-studs or buttons, hooks
and eyes, coat-studs, money-boxes, spoons, boxes
of toys, earthenware-mugs, and glass articles, such
as salt-cellars and smelling-bottles. On one barrow
were 225 articles.</p>

<p>At the back and sides of the swag-barrow are
generally articles which are best displayed in an
erect position. These are children’s wooden
swords, whips, climbing monkeys, and tumblers,
jointed snakes twisting to the wind from the top
of a stick, kites, and such things as tin egg-holders.</p>

<p>Perhaps on very few barrows or stalls are to be
seen <i>all</i> the articles I have enumerated, but they
are all “in the trade,” and, if not found in this
man’s stock, may be found in his neighbour’s.
Things which attain only a temporary sale, such
as galvanic rings, the Lord’s Prayer in the compass
of a sixpence, gutta-percha heads, &amp;c., are
also to be found, during the popular demand, in
the miscellaneous trader’s stock.</p>

<p>Each of the articles enumerated is retailed at
1<i>d.</i> “Only a penny!” is the cry, “pick ’em out
anywhere; wherever your taste lies; only a
penny, a penny, a penny!” But on a few other
barrows are goods, mixed with the “penny”
wares, of a higher price; such as knives and
forks, mustard pots, sham beer glasses (the glasses
which appear to hold beer frothing to the brim),
higher-priced articles of jewellery, skipping-ropes,
drums, china ornaments, &amp;c. At these barrows
the prices run from 1<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The practice of selling by commission, the
same as I have shown to prevail among the
costers, exists among the miscellaneous dealers of
whom I am treating, who are known among street-folk
as “swag-barrowmen,” or, in the popular
ellipsis, “penny swags;” the word “swag” meaning,
as I before showed, a collection&mdash;a lot.</p>

<p>The “swag-men” are often confounded with
the “lot-sellers”; so that I proceed to show the
difference.</p>

<p>The <i>Lot-Sellers</i> proper, are those who vend a
variety of small articles, or “a lot,” all for 1<i>d.</i>
A “lot” frequently consists of a sheet of songs, a
Chinese puzzle, a 5<i>l.</i> note (Bank of Elegance),
an Exhibition snuff-box (containing 6 spoons),
a half jack (half sovereign), a gold ring, a silver
ring, and a chased keeper with rose, thistle, and
shamrock on it. The lots are diversified with
packs of a few cards, little pewter ornaments,
boxes of small wooden toys, shirt-buttons, baby
thimbles, beads, tiny scent bottles, and such like.</p>

<p>The “penny apiece” or “swag” trade, as contradistinguished
from the “penny lots” vended by
the lot-sellers, was originated by a man who, some
19 years ago, sold a variety of trifles from a tea-tray
in Petticoat-lane. My informant had heard
him say&mdash;for the original “penny apiece” died
four years ago&mdash;that he did it to get rid of the odds
and ends of his stock. The system, however, at
once attracted popularity, and the fortunate street-seller
prospered and “died worth money.” At
that period penny goods (excepting such things as
sweet-stuffs, pastry, &amp;c.) were far less numerous
in the streets, and yet I have never met with an
old street-trader (a statement fully borne out by
old and intelligent mechanics) who did not pronounce
spare pennies to be far more abundant in
those days among the poorer and even middle
classes. There were, moreover, far fewer street
chapmen, so that this novel mode of business had
every chance to thrive.</p>

<p>The origin of “lot-selling,” or selling “penny
lots” instead of penny articles, was more curious.
It was commenced by an ingenious Swiss (?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
(about a year after the “penny apiece” trade),
known in the street circles as “Swede.” He was
a refugee, a Roman Catholic, and a hot politician.
He spoke and understood English well,
but had no sympathy with the liberal parties in
this country. “He was a republican,” he would
say, “and the Chartists were only milk and
water.” When he established his lot-selling he
used to place to his mouth an instrument, which
was described to me as “like a doubled card,”
and play upon it very finely. This would attract
a crowd, and he would then address them in good
English, but with a slight foreign accent: “My
frents; come to me, and I will show you my
musical instruments, which will play Italian, Swiss,
French, Scotch, Irish, or any tunes. And here
you see beautiful cheap lots of useful tings, and
elegant tings. A penny a lot, a penny a lot!”
The arrangement of the “lots” was similar to
what it is at present, but the components of the
pennyworth were far less numerous. This man
carried on a good trade in London for two or
three years, and then applied his industry to a
country more than a town career. He died about
five or six years ago, at his abode in Fashion-street,
Spitalfields, “worth money.” At the time of his
decease he was the proprietor of two lodging-houses;
one in Spitalfields, the other in Birmingham, both
I am told, well conducted; the charge was 4<i>d.</i> a
night. He did not reside in either, but employed
“deputies.” I may observe that he sold his “musical
instruments,” also, at 1<i>d.</i> each, but the sale
was insignificant. “Only himself seemed master
of ’em,” said one man; “with other people they
were no better nor a Jew’s-harp.”</p>

<p>Of the “penny apiece” street-vendors, there
are about 300 in London; 250 having barrows,
and 50 stalls or pitches on the ground. Some
even sell at “a halfpenny apiece,” but chiefly to
get rid of inferior wares, or when “cracked up,”
and unable to “spring” a better stock. The barrows
are 7 feet by 3; are well built in general,
and cost 50<i>s.</i> each. These barrows, when fully
stocked, are very heavy (about 4 cwt.), so that it
requires a strong man to propel one any distance,
and though occasionally the man’s wife officiates
as the saleswoman, there is always a man connected
with the business. In my description of
a stock of penny goods, I have mentioned that
there were 225 articles; these were counted on a
barrow in a street near the Brill&mdash;but probably on
another occasion (when there appeared a better
chance of selling) there might be 500 articles, such
things as rings and the like admitting of being
stowed by the hundred in very small compass.
The great display, however, is only on the occasion
of holidays, or “when a man starts and wants
to stun you with a show.” At Maidstone Fair
the other day, a London street-seller, rather well
to do, sold his entire stock of penny articles to a
shopkeeper of the town, and when counted there
were exactly fifteen gross, or 2160 “pieces” as
they are sometimes called. These, vended at 1<i>d.</i>
each, would realize just 9<i>l.</i>, and would cost,
wholesale, about 6<i>l.</i>, or for ready money, at the
swag-shops, where they may be bought, from 10<i>s.</i>
to 20<i>s.</i> less, according to the bargaining powers of
the buyer. The man’s reason for selling was that
the Fair was “no good;” that is to say, the farmers
had no money, and their labourers received
only 7<i>s.</i> a week, so there was no demand; the
swag-seller, therefore, rather than incur the
trouble and expense of having to carry his wares
back to London, sold at a loss to a shopkeeper in
Maidstone, who wanted a stock.</p>

<p>The swag-barrowmen selling on commission
have 3<i>s.</i> in every 20<i>s.</i> worth of goods that they
sell. The commission may average from 9<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>
a week in tolerable weather, but as in bad, and
especially in foggy weather, the trade cannot be
prosecuted at all, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> may be the highest average,
or 10<i>s.</i> the year through.</p>

<p>The character of the penny swag-men belongs
more to that of the costermongers than to any
other class of street-folk. Many of them drink as
freely as their means will permit. I was told of a
match between a teetotaller and a beer-drinker,
about nine years ago. It was for 5<i>s.</i> a side, and
the “Championship.” Each man started with an
equal stock, alike in all respects, but my informant
had forgotten the precise number of articles.
They pattered, twenty-five yards apart one from
another, three hours in James-street, Covent-garden;
three hours in the Blackfriars-road; and
three hours in Deptford. The teetotaller was
“sold out” in seven-and-a-half hours; while his
opponent&mdash;and the contest seems to have been
carried on very good-humouredly&mdash;at the nine
hours’ end, had four dozen articles left, and was
rather exhausted, or, as it was described to me,
“told out.” The result, albeit, was not looked
upon, I was assured, as anything very decisive of
the relative merits of beer or water, as the source
of strength or inspiration of “patter.” The teetotaller
was the smarter, though he did not appear
the stronger, man; he abandoned the championship,
and went into another trade four years ago.
The patter of the swag-men has nothing of the
humour of the paper-workers; it is merely declaratory
that the extensive stock offered on such
liberal terms to the public would furnish a wholesale
shop; that such another opportunity for cheap
pennyworths could never by any possibility occur
again, and that it was a duty on all who heard the
patterer to buy at once.</p>

<p>The men having their own barrows or stalls
(but the stall-trade is small) buy their goods as
they find their stock needs replenishment at the
swag-shops. “It was a good trade at first, sir,”
said one man, “and for its not being a good
trade now, we may partly blame one another.
There was a cutting down trade among us.
Black earrings were bought at 14<i>d.</i> the dozen,
and sold at a loss at 1<i>d.</i> each. So were children’s
trap-bats, and monkeys up sticks, but they are
now 9<i>d.</i> a dozen. Sometimes, sir, as I know,
the master of a swag-barrow gets served out. You
see, a man may once on a time have a good day,
and take as much as 2<i>l.</i> Well, next day he’ll
use part of that money, and go as a penny swag
on his own account; or else he’ll buy things he is
sold out of, and work them on his own account on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
his master’s barrow. All right, sir; his master
makes him a convenience for his own pocket, and
so his master may be made a convenience for the
man’s. When he takes the barrow back at the
week’s end, if he’s been doing a little on his own
dodge, there’s the stock, and there’s the money.
It’s all right between a rich man and a poor
man that way; turn and turn about’s fair play.”</p>

<p>The lot-sellers are, when the whole body are
in London, about 200 in number; but they are
three times as itinerant into the country as are
the traders in the heavier and little portable swag-barrows.
The lot-sellers nearly all vend their
goods from trays slung from their shoulders. The
best localities for the lot-sellers are Ratcliffe-highway,
Commercial-road, Whitechapel, Minories,
Tower-hill, Tooley-street, Newington-causeway,
Walworth, Blackfriars and Westminster-roads,
Long-acre, Holborn, and Oxford-street. To this
list may be added the Brill, Tottenham-court-road,
and the other street-markets, on Saturday evenings,
when some of these places are almost impassable.
The best places for the swag-barrow trade
are also those I have specified. Their customers,
alike for the useful and fancy articles, are the
working-classes, and the chief sale is on Saturdays
and Mondays. One swag-man told me that he
thought he could sell better if he had a less
crowded barrow, but his master was so keen of
money that he <i>would</i> make him try everything.
It made selling more tiresome, too, he said, for a
poor couple who had a penny or two to lay out
would fix on half the things they saw, and change
them for others, before they parted with their
money.</p>

<p>Of the penny-a-piece sellers trading on their
own account, the receipts may be smaller than
those of the men who work the huge swag-barrows
on commission, but their profits are greater. Calculating
that 100 of these traders are, the year
round, in London (some are absent all the summer
at country fairs, and on any favourable opportunity,
while a number of swag-barrowmen leave
that employment for costermongering on their own
account), and that each takes 2<i>l.</i> weekly, we find
no less than 10,400<i>l.</i> thus expended in the streets
of London in a year.</p>

<p>The lot-sellers also resort largely to the country,
and frequently try other callings, such as the sale
of fruit, medals, &amp;c. Some also sell lots only
on Saturday and Monday nights. Taking these
deductions into consideration, it may be estimated
that only fifty men (there is but one female lot-seller
on her own account) carry on the trade,
presuming it to be spread over the six days of
the week. Each of them may take 13<i>s.</i> weekly
(with a profit of 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), so showing the street
outlay to be 1,690<i>l.</i> The “lots” are bought at the
German and English swag-shops; the principal

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Roulette Boxes.</span></h3>

<p>In my account of the street-trade in “China
ornaments” I had occasion to mention a use to
which a roulette box, or portable roulette table,
was put. I need only repeat in this place that
the box (usually of mahogany) contains a board,
with numbered partitions, which is set spinning,
by means of a central knob, on a pivot; the lid
is then placed on the box, a pea is slipped
through a hole in the lid, and on the number of
the partition in which the pea is found deposited,
when the motion has ceased, depends the result. The
table, or board, is thus adapted for the determination
of that mode of raising money, popular among costermongers
and other street-folk, who in their very
charities crave some excitement; I mean a “raffle;”
or it may be used for play, by one or more persons,
the highest number “spun” determining the
winner. These street-sold tables may still be
put to another use: In the smaller sort, “going no
higher than fourteen,” one division is blank. Thus
any one may play against another, or several others
spinning in turns, the “blank” being a chance in
the “banker’s” favour. Some of the tables, however,
are numbered as high as 36, or as a seller of
them described it, “single and double zero, bang;
a French game.”</p>

<p>This curious street-trade has been carried on for
seven years, but with frequent interruptions, by
one man, who, until within these few weeks, was
the sole trader in the article. There are now but
two selling roulette-boxes at all regularly. The
long-established salesman wears mustachios, and
has a good deal the look of a foreigner. During
his seven years’ experience he has sold, he calculates,
12,000 roulette-boxes, at a profit of from
175<i>l.</i> to 200<i>l.</i> The prices (retail) are from 1<i>s.</i> to
2<i>l.</i>, at which high amount my informant once
disposed of “a roulette” in the street. He has
sold, however, more at 1<i>s.</i> than at all other rates
together. The “shilling roulette” is about three
inches in diameter; the others proportionately
larger. These wares are German made, bought at
a swag-shop, and retailed at a profit of from 15 to
33 per cent. They are carried in a basket, one
being held for public examination in the vendor’s
hand.</p>

<p>“My best customers,” said the experienced
man in the business, “are stock-brokers, travellers,
and parsons; people that have spare time on
their hands. O, I mean by ‘travellers,’ gentlemen
going on a railway who pass the time away
at roulette. Now and then a regular ‘leg,’ when
he’s travelling to Chester, York, or Doncaster, to
the races, may draw other passengers into play,
and make a trifle, or not a trifle, by it; or he will
play with other legs; but it’s generally for
amusement, I’ve reason to believe. Friends travelling
together play for a trifle to pass away
time, or who shall pay for breakfasts for two, or
such like. I supplied one gaming-house with a
large roulette-table made of a substance that if you
throw it into water&mdash;and there’s always a pail of
‘tepid’ ready&mdash;would dissolve very quickly. When
it’s not used it’s hung against the wall and is so
made that it looks to be an oil-painting framed.
It cost them 10<i>l.</i> I suppose I have the ‘knock’
of almost every gaming-house in London. There’s
plenty of them still. The police can drive such
as me about in the streets or out of the streets to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
starve, but lords, and gentlemen, and some parsons,
I know, go to the gaming-houses, and when
one’s broke into by the officers&mdash;it’s really funny&mdash;John
Smith, and Thomas Jones, and William
Brown are pulled up, but as no gaming implements
are found, there’s nothing against them.
Some of these houses are never noticed for a long
time. The ‘Great Nick’ hasn’t been, nor the ‘Little
Nick.’ I don’t know why they’re called ‘Nicks,’
those two; but so they are. Perhaps after Old
Nick. At the Great Nick I dare say there’s often
1000<i>l.</i> depending. But the Little Nick is what
we call only ‘brown papermen,’ low gamblers&mdash;playing
for pence, and 1<i>s.</i> being a great go. I
wonder the police allow <i>that</i>.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Poison for Rats.</span></h3>

<p>The number of Vermin-Destroyers and Rat-Catchers
who ply their avocation in London
has of late years become greatly diminished.
One cause which I heard assigned for this
was that many ruinous old buildings and old
streets had been removed, and whole colonies of
rats had been thereby extirpated. Another was
that the race of rat-catchers had become distrusted,
and had either sought some other mode of subsistence,
or had resorted to other fields for the
exercise of their professional labours.</p>

<p>The rat-catcher’s dress is usually a velveteen
jacket, strong corduroy trowsers, and laced boots.
Round his shoulder he wears an oil-skin belt, on
which are painted the figures of huge rats, with
fierce-looking eyes and formidable whiskers. His
hat is usually glazed and sometimes painted after
the manner of his belt. Occasionally&mdash;and in the
country far more than in town&mdash;he carries in his
hand an iron cage in which are ferrets, while two
or three crop-eared rough terriers dog his footsteps.
Sometimes a tamed rat runs about his shoulders
and arms, or nestles in his bosom or in the large
pockets of his coat. When a rat-catcher is thus
accompanied, there is generally a strong aromatic
odour about him, far from agreeable; this is owing
to his clothes being rubbed with oil of thyme and
oil of aniseed, mixed together. This composition
is said to be so attractive to the sense of the rats
(when used by a man who understands its due apportionment
and proper application) that the vermin
have left their holes and crawled to the master of
the powerful spell. I heard of one man (not a rat-catcher
professionally) who had in this way tamed
a rat so effectually that the animal would eat out
of his mouth, crawl upon his shoulder to be fed,
and then “smuggle into his bosom” (the words of
my informant) “and sleep there for hours.” The
rat-catchers have many wonderful stories of the
sagacity of the rat, and though in reciting their
own feats, these men may not be the most trustworthy
of narrators, any work on natural history
will avouch that rats <i>are</i> sagacious, may be trained
to be very docile, and are naturally animals of
great resources in all straits and difficulties.</p>

<p>One great source of the rat-catcher’s employment
and emolument thirty years ago, or even to a later
period, is now comparatively a nonentity. At that
time the rat-catcher or killer sometimes received a
yearly or quarterly stipend to keep a London
granary clear of rats. I was told by a man who
has for twenty-eight years been employed about
London granaries, that he had never known a rat-catcher
employed in one except about twenty or
twenty-two years ago, and that was in a granary by
the river-side. The professional man, he told me,
certainly poisoned many rats, “which stunk so,”
continued my informant&mdash;but then all evil odours
in old buildings are attributed to dead rats&mdash;“that
it was enough to infect the corn. He poisoned
two fine cats as well. But I believe he was a
young hand and a bungler.” The rats, after these
measures had been taken, seem to have deserted
the place for three weeks or a month, when they
returned in as great numbers as ever; nor were
their ravages and annoyances checked until the
drains were altered and rebuilt. It is in the
better disposition of the drains of a corn-magazine,
I am assured, that the great check upon the
inroads of these “varmint” is attained&mdash;by strong
mason work and by such a series and arrangement
of grates, as defy even the perseverance of a rat.
Otherwise the hordes which prey upon the garbage
in the common sewers, are certain to find their
way into the granary along the drains and channels
communicating with those sewers, and will
increase rapidly despite the measures of the rat-catcher.</p>

<p>The same man told me that he had been five or
six times applied to by rat-catchers, and with
liberal offers of beer, to allow them to try and capture
the black rats in the granary. One of these
traders declared that he wanted them “for a gent
as vas curous in them there hinteresting warmint.”
But from the representations of the other applicants,
my informant was convinced that they were
wanted for rat-hunts, the Dog Billy being backed
for 100<i>l.</i> to kill so many rats in so many
minutes. “You see, sir,” the corn merchant’s man
continued, “ours is an old concern, and there’s
black rats in it, great big fellows; some of ’em
must be old, for they’re as white about the muzzle
as is the Duke of Wellington, and they have the
character of being very strong and very fierce. One
of the catchers asked me if I knew what a stunning
big black rat would weigh, as if I weighed
rats! I always told them that I cared nothing
about rat-hunts and that I knew our people
wouldn’t like to be bothered; and they was gentlemen
that didn’t admire sporting characters.”</p>

<p>The black rat, I may observe, or the English
rat, is now comparatively scarce, while the brown,
or Hanoverian, rat is abundant. This brown rat
seems to have become largely domiciled in England
about the period of the establishment of the Hanoverian
dynasty; whence its name. “A Hanover
rat” was a term of reproach applied by the Jacobites
to the successful party.</p>

<p>The rat-catchers are also rat-killers. They
destroy the animals sometimes by giving them
what is called in the trade “an alluring poison.”
Every professional destroyer, or capturer, of rats
will pretend that as to poison he has his own particular
method&mdash;his secret&mdash;his discovery. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
there is no doubt that arsenic is the basis of all
their poisons. Its being inodorous, and easily
reducible to a soft fine powder, renders it the best
adapted for mixing with anything of which rats
are fond&mdash;toasted cheese, or bacon, or fried liver,
or tallow, or oatmeal. Much as the poisoner may
be able to tempt the animal’s appetite, he must,
and does, proceed cautiously. If the bait be placed
in an unwonted spot, it is often untouched. If it
be placed where rats have been accustomed to find
their food, it is often devoured. But even then it
is frequently accounted best to leave the bait unpoisoned
for the first night; so that a hungry
animal may attack it greedily the second. With
oatmeal it is usual to mix for the first and even
second nights a portion of pounded white sugar.
If this be eaten it accustoms the jealous pest to
the degree of sweetness communicated by arsenic.
The “oatmeal poison” is, I am told, the most
effectual; but even when mixed only with sugar
it is often refused; as “rats is often better up to a
dodge nor Kirstians” (Christians).</p>

<p>Another mode of killing rats is for the professional
destroyer to slip a ferret into the rats’
haunts wherever it is practicable. The ferret
soon dislodges them, and as they emerge for
safety they are seized by terriers, who, after
watching the holes often a long time, and very
patiently, and almost breathlessly, throttle them
silently, excepting the short squeak, or half-squeak,
of the rat, who, by a “good dog,” is seized unerringly
by the part of the back where the
terrier’s gripe and shake is speedy death; if the
rat still move, or shows signs of life, the well-trained
rat-killer’s dog cracks the vermin’s skull
between his teeth.</p>

<p>If the rats have to be taken alive, they are
either trapped, so as not to injure them for a rat-hunt
(or the procedure in the pit would be accounted
“foul”), or if driven out of their holes by
ferrets, they can only run into some cask, or other
contrivance, where they can be secured for the
“sportsman’s” purposes. Although any visible
injury to the body of the rat will prevent its reception
into a pit, the creatures’ teeth are often
drawn, and with all the cruelty of a rough
awkwardness, by means of pinchers, so that they
may be unable to bite the puppies being trained
for the pit on the rats. If the vermin be not
truly seized by the dog, the victim will twist
round and inflict a tremendous bite on his worrier,
generally on the lip. This often causes the
terrier to drop his prey with a yell, and if a puppy
he may not forget the lesson from the sharp nip
of the rat. To prevent this it is that the rat-catchers
play the dentist on their unfortunate captives.</p>

<p>I heard many accounts of the “dodges” practised
by, or imputed to, the rat-catchers: that it
was not a very unusual thing to deposit here and
there a dead rat, when those vermin were to be
poisoned on any premises; it is then concluded
that the good poison has done its good work, and
the dead animal supplies an ocular demonstration
of professional skill. These men, also, I am informed,
let loose live rats in buildings adapted for
the purpose, and afterwards apply for employment
to destroy them.</p>

<p>I am informed that the principal scene of the
rat-catcher’s labours in London is at the mews,
and in private stables, coach-houses, and out-buildings.
It is probable that the gentlemen’s
servants connected with such places like the excitement
of rat-hunting, and so encourage the
profession which supplies them with that gratification.
In these places such labours are often
necessary as well as popular; for I was informed
by a coachman, then living with his family in a
West End mews, and long acquainted with the
mews in different parts of town, that the drainage
was often very defective, and sanitary regulations&mdash;except,
perhaps, as regarded the horses&mdash;little
cared for. Hence rats abounded, and were with
difficulty dislodged from their secure retreats in
the ill-constructed drains and kennels.</p>

<p>The great sale of the rat-catchers is to the
shops supplying “private parties” with rats for
the amusement of seeing them killed by dogs.
With some “fast” men, one of these shopkeepers
told me, it was a favourite pastime in their own
rooms on the Sunday mornings. It is, however,
somewhat costly if carried on extensively, as the
retail charge from the shops is 6<i>d.</i> per rat. The
price from the catcher to the dealer is from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 7<i>s.</i> the dozen. Rats, it appears, are sometimes
scarce, and then the shopkeeper must buy, “to
keep up his connection,” at enhanced cost. One
large bird-seller, who sold also plain and fancy
rats, white mice, and live hedgehogs, told me
that he had, last winter, been compelled to give
7<i>s.</i> a dozen for his vermin and sell them at 6<i>d.</i>
each.</p>

<p>The grand consumption of rats, however, is in
Bunhill-row, at a public-house kept by a pugilist.
A rat-seller told me that from 200 to 500 rats
were killed there weekly, the weekly average
being, however, only the former number; while
at Easter and other holidays, it is not uncommon
to see bills posted announcing the destruction of
500 rats on the same day and in a given time,
admittance 6<i>d.</i> Dogs are matched at these and
similar places, as to which kills the greatest
number of these animals in the shortest time.
I am told that there are forty such places in London,
but in some only the holiday times are celebrated
in this small imitation of the beast combats
of the ancients. There is, too, a frequent abandonment
of the trade in consequence of its “not
paying,” and perhaps it may be fair to estimate
that the average consumption of this vermin-game
does not exceed, in each of these places, 20 a
week, or 1040 in a year; giving an aggregate&mdash;over
and above those consumed in private sport&mdash;of
52,000 rats in a year, or 1000 a week in
public amusement alone.</p>

<p>To show the nature of the sport of rat-catching,
I print the following bill, of which I procured two
copies. The words and type are precisely the
same in each, but one bill is printed on good and
the other on very indifferent paper, as if for distribution
among distinct classes. The concluding
announcement, as to the precise moment at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
killing will commence, reads supremely business-<span class="lock">like:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A dealer in live animals told me that there
were several men who brought a few dozens of
rats, or even a single dozen, from the country;
men who were not professionally rat-catchers, but
worked in gardens, or on farms, and at their
leisure caught rats. Even some of the London
professional rat-catchers work sometimes as country
labourers, and their business is far greater, in
merely rat-catching or killing, in the country than
in town. From the best information I could command,
there are not fewer than 2000 rats killed,
for sport, in London weekly, or 104,000 a year,
including private and public sport, for private
sport in this pursuit goes on uninterruptedly; the
public delectation therein is but periodical.</p>

<p>This calculation is of course exclusive of the
number of rats <i>killed</i> by the profession, “on the
premises,” when these men are employed to “clear
the premises of vermin.”</p>

<p>There are, I am told, 100 rat-catchers resorting,
at intervals, to London, but only a fourth of that
number can be estimated as carrying on their
labours regularly in town, and their average
earnings, I am assured, do not exceed 15<i>s.</i> a
week; being 975<i>l.</i> a year for London merely.</p>

<p>These men have about them much of the affected
mystery of men who are engaged on the turf.
They have their “secrets,” make or pretend to
“make their books” on rat fights and other sporting
events; are not averse to drinking, and lead
in general irregular lives. They are usually on
intimate terms with the street dog-sellers (who
are much of the same class). Many of the rat-catchers
have been brought up in stables, and
there is little education among them. When in
London, they are chiefly to be found in Whitechapel,
Westminster, and Kent-street, Borough;
the more established having their own rooms; the
others living in the low lodging-houses. None of
them remain in London the entire year.</p>

<p>These men also sell rat-poison (baked flour or
oatmeal sometimes) in cakes, arsenic being the
ingredient. The charge is from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>, “according
to the circumstances of the customer.” In
like manner the charge for “clearing a house of
vermin” varies from 2<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i>: a very frequent
charge is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Rhubarb
and Spice.</span></h3>

<p>From the street-seller whose portrait has already
been given I received the following history. He
appeared to be a very truthful and kindly-disposed
old <span class="lock">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am one native of Mogadore in Morocco. I am
an Arab. I left my countree when I was sixteen or
eighteen year of age. I forget, sir. I don’t know
which, about eighteen, I tink it was. My fader was
like market man, make de people pay de toll&mdash;he
rent de whole market, you see, from de governemen,
and make de people pay so much for deir stands.
I can’t tell you what dey call dem dere. I couldn’t
recollect what my fader pay for de market; but
I know some of de people pay him a penny, some
a ha’penny, for de stands. Dere everyting sheap, not
what dey are here in England. Dey may stop all
day for de toll or go when de market is over.
My fader was not very rish&mdash;not very poor&mdash;he
keep a family. We have bread, meat, shicken,
apples, grapes, all de good tings to eat, not like
here&mdash;tis de sheapest countree in de world. My
fader have two wifes, not at once you know, he
bury de first and marry anoder. I was by
second wife. He have seven shildren by her, four
sons and tree daughters. By de first I tink dere
was five, two sons and tree daughters. Bless
you, by de time I was born dere was great many
of ’em married and away in de world. I don’t
know where dey are now. Only one broder I got
live for what I know, wheder de oders are dead or
where dey are I can’t tell. De one broder I speak
of is in Algiers now; he is dealer dere. What led
me to come away, you say? Like good many I
was young and foolish; like all de rest of young
people, I like to see foreign countries, but you see
in my countree de governemen don’t like de
people to come away, not widout you pay so mush,
so Gibraltar was de only port I could go to, it was
only one twenty miles across de water&mdash;close to
us. You see you go to Gibraltar like smuggling&mdash;you
smuggle yourself&mdash;you talk wid de Captain
and he do it for you.</p>

<p>“My fader been dead years and years before I
come away, I suppose I was about ten year old
when he die. I had been at school till time I
was grown up, and after dat I was shoemaker.
I make de slippers. Oh yes! my moder was alive
den&mdash;she was dead when I was here in England.
I get about one penny a pair for de slippers in
my countree; penny dere as good as shilling here
amost. I could make tree, four, five pair in one
day. I could live on my gains den better dan
what I could do here wid twelve times as mush&mdash;dat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
time I could. I don’t know what it is now.
Yes, my moder give me leave to go where I like.
She never see me since” (sighing). “Oh yes, I
love her very mush. I am old man now, but I never
forgot her yet;” here the old man burst into tears
and buried his face in his handkerchief for several
minutes. “No, no! she don’t know when I come
away dat she never see me again, nor me neider.
I tell I go Gibraltar, and den I tell her I go to
Lisbon to see my broder, who was spirit merchant
dere. I didn’t say noting not at all about coming
back to her, but I tought I should come back
soon. If I had tought I never see no more, not
all de gold in de world take me from her. She
was good moder to me. I was de youngest but
one. My broders kept my moder, you see. Where
I came from it is not like here, if only one in de
family well off, de oders never want for noting.
In my country, you see, de law is you must maintain
your fader and moder before you maintain
your own family. You must keep dem in de
house.” Here he repeated the law in Hebrew.
“De people were Mahomedans in Mogadore, but
we were Jews, just like here, you see. De first
ting de Jews teesh de shildren is deir duty to deir
faders and deir moders. And dey love one anoder
more than de gold; but dey love de gold more
dan most people, for you see gold is more to dem.
In my countree de governemen treat de Jews very
badly, so de money all de Jews have to help dem.
Often de government in my country take all deir
money from de Jews, and kill dem after, so de
Jews all keep deir money in secret places, put de
gold in jars and dig dem in de ground, and de
men worths hundreds go about wid no better
clothes dan mine.</p>

<p>“Well, you see I leave my poor moder, we kissed
one anoder, and cry for half an hour, and come
away to Gibraltar. When I get dere, my broder
come away from Lisbon to Gibraltar; dat time it
was war time, and de French was coming to Lisbon,
so everybody run. When I come away
from Mogadore, I have about one hundred dollars&mdash;some
my moder give me, and some I had save.
When I got to Gibraltar, I begin to have a little
stand in de street wid silk handkershiefs, cotton
handkershiefs, shop goods you know. I do
very well wid dat, so after I get licence to hawk
de town, and after dat I keep shop. Altogeder,
I stop in Gibraltar about six year. I had den
about five or six hundred dollars. I live very
well all de time I dere. I was wid my broder
all de time. After I am six year in Gibraltar,
I begin to tink I do better in England. I tink,
like good many people, if I go to anoder part dat
is risher&mdash;’t is de rishest countree in de world&mdash;I
do better still. So I start off, and get I
here I tink in 1811, when de tree shilling pieces
first come out. I have about one hundred and
tirty pound at dat time. I stop in London a
good bit, and eat my money; it was most done
before I start to look for my living. I try to
look what I could do, but I was quite stranger
you see. I am about fourteen or fifteen month
before I begin to do anyting. I go to de play
house; I see never such tings as I see here before
I come. When I come here, I tink I am in heaven
altogether&mdash;God a’mighty forgive me&mdash;such sops
(shops) and such beautiful tings. I live in Mary
Axe Parish when I first come; same parish where
I live now. Well, you see some of my countreemen
den getting good living by selling de
rhubarb and spices in de street. I get to know
dem all; and dat time you see was de good
time, money was plenty, like de dirt here.
Dat time dere was about six or seven Arabians in
de street selling rhubarb and spices, five of ’em
was from Mogadore, and two from not far off;
and dere is about five more going troo de country.
Dey all sell de same tings, merely rhubarb and
spice, dat time; before den was good for tem tings&mdash;after
dat dey get de silks and tings beside. I can’t
tell what first make dem sell de rhubarb and de
spice; but I tink it is because people like to buy
de Turkey rhubarb of de men in de turbans.
When I was little shild, I hear talk in Mogadore
of de people of my country sell de rhubarb in
de streets of London, and make plenty money
by it.</p>

<p>“Dere was one very old Arabian in de streets
wen I first come; dey call him Sole; he been
forty year at de same business. He wear de long
beard and Turkish dress. He used to stand by
Bow Shursh, Sheapside. Everybody in de street
know him. He was de old establish one. He
been dead now, let me see&mdash;how long he been
dead&mdash;oh, dis six or seven and twenty year. He
die in Gibraltar very poor and very old&mdash;most
ninety year of age. All de rhubarb-sellers was
Jews. Dere was anoder called Ben Aforiat, and
two broders; and anoder, his name was Azuli.
One of Aforiat’s broders use to stand in St. Paul’s
Shurshyard. He was very well know; all de
oders hawk about de town like I do myself. Now
dey all gone dead, and dere only four of us now
in England; dey all in London, and none in de
country. Two of us live in Mary Axe, anoder
live in, what dey call dat&mdash;Spitalfield, and de
oder in Petticoat-lane. De one wat live in
Spitalfield is old man, I dare say going for 70.
De one in Petticoat-lane not mush above 30. I
am little better dan 73, and de oder wat live in
Mary Axe about 40. I been de longest of all in
de streets, about tirty-eight or tirty-nine year.
All dat was here when I first come, die in
London, except dat old man Sole wat I was
telling you of, dat die in Gibraltar. About
tirteen or fourteen die since I come to England;
some die in de Hospital of de Jews at Mile End;
some die at home&mdash;not one of dem die worth
no money. Six of dem was very old people,
between 60 and 70; dere was some tirty, some
forty. Some of dem die by inshes. Dere was
one fine fellow, he was six foot two, and strong
man, he take to his bed and fall away so; at last
you see troo his hand; he was noting but de carcase;
oders die of what you call de yellow jaundice;
some have de fever, but deir time was come;
de death we must be.</p>

<p>“When I first come to dis countree me make
plenty of money by selling de rhubarb in de street.
Five-and-twenty year ago I make a pound a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
some time. Take one week wid another, I dare
say I clear, after I pay all de cost of my living,
tirty shillings; and now, God help me, I don’t
make not twelve shilling a week, and all my
food to pay out of dat. One week wid anoder,
when I go out I clear about twelve shilling.
Everyting is so sheep now, and dere is so
many sops (shops), people has no money to
buy tings with. I could do better when everyting
was dear. I could live better, get more money,
and have more for it. I have better food, better
lodging, and better clothes. I don’t know wat
is de cause, as you say. I only know dat I am
worse, and everybody is worse; dat is all I know.
Bread is sheeper, but when it was one and ninepence
de loaf I could get plenty to buy it wid, but
now it is five pence, I can’t no five pence to have
it. If de cow is de penny in de market what is de
use of dat, if you can’t get no penny to buy him?
After I been selling my rhubarb for two years,
when I fust come here, I save about a hundred
and fifty pound, and den you see I agree wid tree
oder of my countrymen to take a sop (shop) in
Exeter. De oder tree was rhubarb-sellers, like
myself, and have save good bit of money as well.
One have seven hundred pound; but he have brought
tree or four hundred pound wid him to dis countree.
Anoder of de tree have about two hundred,
and de oder about one hundred; dey have all save
deir money out of de rhubarb. We keep our sop,
you see, about five year, and den we fall in pieces
altogeder. We take and trust, and lose all our
money. T’oders never keep a sop before, and not
one of us was English scholar; we was forced to
keep a man, and dat way we lose all our money,
so we was force to part, and every one go look for
hisself. Den we all go selling rhubarb again
about de country, and in London; and I never
able to hold up my head since. When I come
back to de rhubarb times is getting bad, and I
not able to save no more money. All I am worth
in de world is all I got in my box, and dat altogether
is not more dan ten shilling. Last week
I havn’t a pound of meat in de house, and I am
obliged to pawn my waistcoat and handkerchief
to get me some stock. It easy to put dem in,
but very hard to get dem out.</p>

<p>“I had two wives. After two or tree year when
I come I marry my first. I had two shildren by
my first, but both of dem die very young; one
was about five year old and de oder about tree.
When I travel the countree, my first wife she go
wid me everywhere. I been to all parts&mdash;to
Scotland, to Wales, but not Ireland. I see enough
of dem Irish in dis countree, I do no want no
more of dem dere. Not one of my countree I
tink ever been to Ireland, and only one beside
myself been to Scotland; but dat no use, de
Scotsh don’t know wat de spice is. All de time I
am in Scotland I can’t get no bread, only barley
and pea meal, and dat as sour as de winegar&mdash;and
I can’t get no flour to make none too&mdash;so I
begin to say, by God I come to wrong countree
here. When I go across de countree of England
I never live in no lodging-houses&mdash;always in de
public&mdash;because you see I do business dere; de
missus perhaps dere buy my spices of me. I
lodge once in Taunton, at a house where a woman
keep a lodging-house for de Jewish people wat go
about wid de gold tings&mdash;de jewellery. At oder
towns I stop at de public, for dere is de company,
and I sell my tings.</p>

<p>“I buy my rhubarb and my spice of de large
warehouse for de drugs; sometime I buy it of my
countreemen. We all of us know de good spice
from de bad. You look! I will show you how
to tell de good nutmeg from de bad. Here is
some in de shell: you see, I put de strong pin in
one and de oil run out; dat is because dey has
not been put in de spirit to take away de oil for
to make de extract. Now, in de bad nutmeg all
de oil been took out by de spirit, and den dere is
no flavour, like dose you buy in de sheep sops
(cheap shops). I sell de Rhubarb, East Indy and
Turkey, de Cloves, Cinnamons, Mace, Cayenne
Pepper, White Pepper&mdash;a little of all sorts when
I get de money to buy it wid. I take my solemn
oat I never sheat in scales nor weight; because
de law is, ‘take weight and give weight,’ dat is
judge and justice. Dere is no luck in de sort
weight&mdash;no luck at all. Never in my life I put no
tings wid my goods. I tell you de troot, I grind
my white pepper wid my own hands, but I buy me
ginger ground, and <i>dat</i> is mixed I know. I tink
it is pea flour dey put wid it, dere is no smell in dat,
but it is de same colour&mdash;two ounces of ginger will
give de smell to one pound of pea flour. De public-houses
<i>will</i> have de sheap ginger and dat I buy.
I tell you de troot. How am I tell what will
become of me. Dat is de Almighty’s work” (here
he pointed to Heaven). “De Jews is very good to
deir old people. If it was not for my old woman
I be like a gentleman now in de hospital at Mile
End; but you see, I marry de Christian woman,
and dat is against our people&mdash;and I would never
leave her&mdash;no not for all de good in de world to
come to myself. If I am poor, I not de only one.
In de holiday times I send a petition, and perhaps
dere is five shillings for me from de hospital. In
de Jews’ Hospital dere is only ten&mdash;what you call
de Portuguese Jews. We have hospital to our
ownselves. Dere de old people&mdash;dey are all
above sixty&mdash;are all like noblemen, wid good
clothes, plenty to eat, go where you like, and pipe
of tobacco when you want. But I wont go in no
hospital away from my old woman. I will get a
bit of crust for her as long as I can stand&mdash;but I
can hardly do that now. Every one got his feeling,
and I will feel for her as long as I live.
When dere is de weather I have de rheumatis&mdash;oh!
very bad&mdash;sometime I can scarcely stand or
walk. I am seventy-tree, and it is a sad time for
me now. I am merry sometime tho’. Everyting
wid de pocket. When de pocket is merry, den I
am merry too. Sometime I go home wid one
shilling, and den I tink all gets worse and worse,
and what will become of me I say&mdash;but dat is
de Almighty’s work, and I trust in him. Can I
trust any better one? Sometime I say I wish I
was back in my countree&mdash;and I tink of my poor
moder wat is dead now, and den I am very sad.
Oh yes, bless your heart, very sad indeed!”</p>

<p>The old man appears to sell excellent articles,
and to be a very truthful, fair-dealing man.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Hawking of Tea.</span></h3>

<p>“Persons hawking tea without a licence” (<i>see</i>
Chitty’s Edition of “Burn’s Justice,” vol. ii.
p. 1113) “are liable to a penalty, under 50 Geo.
III., cap. 41.; and, even though they had a
licence, they would be liable to a penalty for
selling tea in an unentered place.” The penalty
under this act is 10<i>l.</i>, but the prohibition in question
has long been commonly, if not very directly,
evaded.</p>

<p>The hawking of tea in London cannot be considered
as immediately a street-trade, but it is
in some respects blended with street callings
and street traffic, so that a brief account is necessary.</p>

<p>I will first give a short history of what is, or
was, more intimately a portion of the street-trade.</p>

<p>Until about eight or ten years ago, tea was extensively
hawked&mdash;from house to house almost&mdash;“on
tally.” The tally system is, that wherein
“weekly payments” are taken in liquidation of
the cost of the article purchased, and the trade is
one embodying much of evil and much of trickery.
At the present time the tallymen are very numerous
in London, and in the tally trade there
are now not less than 1000 hawkers of, or travellers
in, tea; but they carry on their business
principally in the suburbs. When I come to treat
of the class whom I have called “distributors,” I
shall devote an especial inquiry to the tally trade,
including, of course, the tea trade. Mr. M’Culloch
mentions that a Scotchman’s “tally-walk”&mdash;and
the majority of the tallymen are Scotchmen&mdash;is
worth 15 per cent. more than an Englishman’s.</p>

<p>The branch of the tea trade closely connected
with the street business is that in tea-leaves. The
exhausted leaves of the tea-pot are purchased of
servants or of poor women, and they are made
into “new” tea. One gentleman&mdash;to whose information,
and to the care he took to test the
accuracy of his every statement, I am bound to
express my acknowledgments&mdash;told me that it
would be fair to reckon that in London 1500 lbs.
of tea-leaves were weekly converted into new tea,
or 78,000 lbs. in the year! One house is known
to be very extensively and profitably concerned in
this trade, or rather <i>manufacture</i>, and on my
asking the gentleman who gave me the information
if the house in question (he told me the
name) was accounted respectable by their fellow-citizens,
the answer was at once, “<i>Highly</i> respectable.”</p>

<p>The <i>old</i> tea-leaves, to be converted into <i>new</i>,
are placed by the manufacturers on hot plates, and
are re-dried and <i>re-dyed</i>. To give the “green”
hue, a preparation of copper is used. For the
“black” no dye is necessary in the generality of
cases. This tea-manufacture is sold to “cheap”
or “slop” shopkeepers, both in town and country,
and especially for hawking in the country, and is
almost always sold ready mixed.</p>

<p>The admixture of sloe-leaves, &amp;c., which used
to be gathered for the adulteration of tea, is now
unknown, and has been unknown since tea became
cheaper, but the old tea-leaf trade, I am
assured, carried on so quietly and cleverly, that
the most vigilant excise-officers are completely in
the dark; a smaller “tea-maker” was, however,
fined for tea-leaf conversion last year.</p>

<p>Into this curious question, concerning the
purposes for which the old tea-leaves are now
purchased by parties in the street, I shall enter
searchingly when I treat of the <i>street-buyers</i>. The
information I have already received is of great
curiosity and importance, nor shall I suppress the
names of those dishonest traders who purchase the
old dried tea-leaves, as a means of cheating their
customers.</p>

<p>Into the statistics of this strange trade I will
not now enter, but I am informed that great
quantities of tea-leaves are sent from the country
to London. Perhaps of the 1500 lbs. weekly
manufactured, three quarters may be collected in
the metropolis.</p>

<p>I may here add, that the great bulk of the tea
<i>now</i> hawked throughout the metropolis is supplied
from the handsome cars, or vans, of well-known
grocers and tea-dealers. Of these&mdash;it
was computed for me&mdash;there are, on no day,
fewer than 100 in the streets of London, and of
its contiguous and its more remote suburbs, such
as Woolwich, and even Barnet. One tradesman
has six such cars. The tea is put up in bags of 7,
14, and 21 lbs., duly apportioned in quarter, half,
and whole pounds; a quarter of a pound being
the smallest quantity vended in this manner. The
van and its contents are then entrusted to a
driver, who has his regular round, and very often
his regular customers. The customers purchase
the tea from their faith in the respectability of the
firm&mdash;generally well known through extensive
advertising. The teas <i>are</i> supplied by the house
which is pronounced to supply them; for the
tradesman is the capitalist in the matter, his carman
is the labourer, and the house is responsible
for the quality of the article. When a new connection
has to be formed, or an “old connection”
to be extended, circulars (<i>bonâ fide</i>) are sent
round, and the carman afterwards calls: and, “in
some genteel streets,” I was told, “calls, oft
enough, at every house, and, in many districts, at
every decent-looking house in every street.” So
far, then, even this part of the traffic may be considered
one of the streets. The remuneration of
the street-traveller in, or hawker of, tea, is usually
1<i>d.</i> per lb. on the lower-priced kinds, 2<i>d.</i> on the
higher (but more often 1<i>d.</i>) and, very rarely indeed,
3<i>d.</i> on the highest. The trade is one peculiar
to great cities&mdash;and most peculiar, I am assured,
to London&mdash;for the tradesman does not
know so much as the name of his customer; nor,
perhaps, does the carman, but merely as “Number
such-an-one.” The supply is for ready money, or,
if credit be given, it is at the risk of the carman,
who has a weekly wage in addition to his perquisites.
Every evening, when the vehicle is
driven back to the premises of its owner, “stock
is taken,” and the money taken by the carman&mdash;minus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
what may be called the “poundage”&mdash;is
paid over to the proper party.</p>

<p>A man who had driven, or, as he called it,
“managed,” one of these vans, told me that he
made this way, 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day; “but,” he
added, “if you make a good thing of it that way,
you have all the less salary.” These carmen are
men of good character and good address, and were
described to me, by a gentleman familiar with the
trade, as “of the very best class of porters.”</p>

<p>As this vehicular-itinerant business has now
become an integral part of the general tea-trade,
I need not further dwell upon it, but reserve it
until I come to treat of the shopmen of grocers
and tea-dealers, and thence of the tea-trade in
general. I may add, however, that the tea thus
hawked is, as regards, perhaps, three-fourths of
the quantity sold, known as “mixed,” and sold at
4<i>s.</i> per lb.&mdash;costing, at a tea-broker’s, from 2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>
to 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> It is announced, as to its staple
or entire compound, to be “congou,” but is in
reality a tea known as “pouchong.” Some old
ladies are still anxious, I was told, for a cup of
good strong bohea; and though bohea has been
unknown to the tea-trade since the expiration of the
East India Company’s Charter in 1834, the accommodating
street-traveller will undertake to supply
the genuine leaf to which the old lady had
been so long accustomed. The green teas thus sold
(and they are not above a fiftieth part of the
other) are common twankays and common young
hysons, neither of them&mdash;I can state on excellent
authority&mdash;accounted in the trade to be “true
teas,” but, as in the case of some other green
tea, “Canton made.” The “green” is sold from
the vans generally at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; sometimes, but
rarely, as high as 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> What is sold at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
may cost, on the average, 3<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> I may add,
also, that when a <i>good</i> article is supplied, such
profits in the tea-trade are not accounted at all
excessive.</p>

<p>But the more usual mode of tea hawking is by
itinerant dealers who have a less direct connection
with the shop whereat they purchase their goods.
To this mode of obtaining a livelihood, the hawkers
are invited by all the persuasive powers of
advertising eloquence: “To persons in want of a
genteel and lucrative employment”&mdash;“To Gentlemen
of good address and business habits,” &amp;c., &amp;c.
The genteel and lucrative employment is to hawk
tea under the auspices of this “company” or the
other. The nature of this business, and of the
street tea-trade generally, is shown in the following
statement:&mdash;“About twelve years ago I came
to London in expectation of a situation as tide-waiter;
I did not succeed, however, and not being
able to obtain any other employment, and trusting
to the promises of gentlemen M.P.s for too long
a time, my means were exhausted, and I was
at length induced to embark in the tea business.
To this I was persuaded by a few friends who
advanced me some money, considering that it
would suit me well, while my friends would
endeavour to get me a connection, that is, procure
me customers. I accordingly went to a well-known
Tea Company in the City, a firm bearing
a great name. Their advertisements put
forth extraordinary statements, of so many persons
realizing independencies from selling their teas,
and in very short spaces of time. I was quite
pleased at the prospect presented to me in such
glowing terms, and, depending not a little on my
own industry and perseverance, I embraced the
opportunity and introduced myself forthwith to
the Company. They advised me in the first
place to take out a licence for selling teas, to secure
me against any risk of fines or forfeitures.
The cost of a licence, after payment of 2<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i>
preliminary expenses, is 11<i>s.</i> per annum, to be
paid quarterly, as it becomes due, and it is paid
by the Company for their agents. The licence is
granted for the place of abode of the ‘traveller,’
and strictly prohibits him from hawking or exposing
his wares for sale at places other than at
such place of abode, but he may of course supply
his customers where he will, and serve them at
their places of abode respectively. Everything
thus prepared, I commenced operations, but soon
found that this tea dealing was not so advantageous
as I had anticipated. I found that the
commission allowed by the Company on cheap
teas was very low. For those generally used by
the working people, ‘4<i>s.</i> tea,’ for instance, or
that at 4<i>s.</i> per pound, I had to pay to the Company
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pound, thus allowing the travelling
dealer or agent for commission only 6<i>d.</i> in
the pound, or 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per quarter. Now 80 or
100 customers is considered a fair connection
for a dealer, and allowing each customer to take a
quarter of a pound at an average, 80 good customers
at that rate would bring him 10<i>s.</i>,
or 100 customers 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> clear profit weekly.
But many customers do not require so much as a
quarter of a pound weekly, while others require
more, so that I find it rather awkward to subdivide
it in portions to suit each customer, as the
smallest quantity made at the warehouse is a
quarter of a pound, and every quarter is done up
in a labelled wrapper, with the price marked on it.
So that to break or disturb the package in any
way might cause some customers to suspect that
it had been meddled with unfairly.</p>

<p>“Another disadvantage was in dealing with the
‘Tea Company.’ No sugars are supplied by
them, which makes it more inconvenient for the
travelling dealer, as his customers find it difficult
to get sugars, most retail grocers having an objection
to sell sugars to any but those who are purchasers
of teas as well. However, I was not
confined to deal with this Company, and so I tried
other places, and found a City house, whose terms
were preferable. Here I could get tea for 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>,
as good as that for which the Company charged
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, besides getting it done up to order in plain
paper, and in quantities to suit every variety of
customer. There were also sugars, which must be
had to accommodate the customers, at whatever
trouble or inconvenience to the traveller; for it is
very lumbersome to carry about, and leaves
scarcely any profit at all.</p>

<p>“The trade is anything but agreeable, and the
customers are often exacting. They seem to fancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
however cheaply and well they may be supplied,
that the tea-seller is under obligations to them;
that their custom will be the making of him, and,
therefore, they expect some compliment in return.
The consequence is, that very often, unless he be
willing to be accounted a ‘shabby man,’ the tea-dealer
is obliged, of a Saturday night, to treat his
customers, to ensure a continuance of their custom.
Other customers take care to be absent at
the time he calls. Those who are anxious to run
up bills, perhaps, keep out of the way purposely
for two or more successive nights of the dealer’s
calling, who, notwithstanding, cannot very well
avoid serving such customers. This is another evil,
and if the tea-man’s capital be not sufficient to enable
him to carry on the business in this manner,
giving credit (for it is unavoidable), he is very
soon insolvent, and compelled to give up the
business. I had to give it up at last, after having
carried it on for four years, leaving 8<i>l.</i> or 9<i>l.</i> due
to me, in small sums, varying from 1<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>, one
shilling of which I never expect to be paid. I could
not have continued it so long, for my means would
not allow me to give credit; but getting partial
employment at the last-mentioned house, where I
dealt, enabled me to do so. When, however, I
got permanently employed, I grew tired of tea-dealing,
and gave it up.</p>

<p>“In my opinion the business would best suit
persons casually employed, such as dockmen and
others, who might have leisure to go about; those
also who get other commissions and hawk about
other commodities, such as soft wares, might do
very well by it; otherwise, in most cases, ’t is only
resorted to as a make-shift where no other employment
can be obtained.</p>

<p>“I do not know how many persons are in the
trade. I have, however, heard it asserted, that
there were between 4000 and 5000 persons in
London engaged in the business, who are, with
but few exceptions, Scotchmen; they, of all others,
manage to do the best <i>in this</i> line.</p>

<p>“A man, to undertake the tea business, requires
a double capital, because in the first place, he has
to purchase the tea, then he must give credit, and
be able to support himself till such time as he can
get in his money. Some of the tea-dealers manage
to eke out their profits by mixing tea-leaves,
which have been used, with the genuine commodity.
They spread the old tea-leaves on tins
which they have for the purpose, and, by exposing
them either to the action of the air or the heat of
the fire, the leaves crisp up as they had been
before they were used, and are not distinguishable
from the rest. I never vended such an article,
and that may be one reason why I could not succeed
in the business.”</p>

<p>I believe the career thus detailed is a common
one among the hawkers of tea, or rather the
“travellers” in the tea trade. Many sell it on
tally.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_WOMEN_STREET-SELLERS"></a>OF THE WOMEN STREET-SELLERS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the volume is now fast drawing to a close, and
a specific account has been furnished of almost every
description of street-<i>seller</i> (with the exception of
those who are the <i>makers</i> of the articles they
vend), I purpose giving a more full and general
history and classification than I have yet done of
the feminine portion of the traders in the streets.</p>

<p>The women engaged in street-sale are of all
ages and of nearly all classes. They are, however,
chiefly of two countries, England and Ireland.
There are (comparatively) a few Jewesses,
and a very few Scotchwomen and Welchwomen
who are street-traders; and they are so, as it
were, accidentally, from their connection, by marriage
or otherwise, with male street-sellers. Of
foreigners there are German broom-women, and a
few Italians with musical instruments.</p>

<p>The first broad and distinctive view of the
female street-sellers, is regarding them <i>nationally</i>,
that is to say, either English or Irish women&mdash;two
classes separated by definite characteristics
from each other.</p>

<p>The Irishwomen&mdash;to avoid burthening the
reader with an excess of subdivisions&mdash;I shall
speak of generally; that is to say, as one homogeneous
class, referring those who require a more
specific account to the description before given of
the street-sellers.</p>

<p>The Englishwomen selling in the streets appear
to admit of being arranged into four distinct
groups, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Wives of Street-Sellers.</p>

<p>2. Mechanics’ or Labourers’ Wives, who go out
Street-Selling (while their husbands are at work)
as a means of helping out the family income.</p>

<p>3. Widows of former Street-Sellers.</p>

<p>4. Single Women.</p>

<p>I do not know of any street-trade carried on
<i>exclusively</i> by women. The sales in which they
are principally concerned are in fish (including
shrimps and oysters), fruit and vegetables (widows
selling on their own account), fire-screens and ornaments,
laces, millinery, artificial flowers (but
not in any great majority over the male traders),
cut flowers, boot and stay-laces and small wares,
wash-leathers, towels, burnt linen, combs, bonnets,
pin-cushions, tea and coffee, rice-milk, curds
and whey, sheeps’-trotters, and dressed and undressed
dolls.</p>

<p>What may be called the “heavier” trades,
those necessitating the carrying of heavy weights,
or the pushing of heavily-laden barrows, are in
the hands of men; and so are, even more exclusively,
what may be classed as the more skilled
trades of the streets, viz. the sale of stationery,
of books, of the most popular eatables and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
drinkables (the coffee-stalls excepted), and in
every branch dependent upon the use of patter.
In such callings as root-selling, crock-bartering,
table-cover selling, mats, game, and poultry, the
wife is the helpmate of her husband; if she trade
separately in these things, it is because there is a
full stock to dispose of, which requires the exertions
of two persons, perhaps with some hired
help just for the occasion.</p>

<p>The difference in the street-traffic, as carried on
by Englishwomen and Irishwomen, is marked
enough. The Irishwoman’s avocations are the
least skilled, and the least remunerative, but as
regards mere toil, such as the carrying of a heavy
burthen, are by far the most laborious. An Irishwoman,
though not reared to the streets, will carry
heavy baskets of oranges or apples, principally when
those fruits are cheap, along the streets while her
English co-trader (if not a costermonger) may be
vending laces, millinery, artificial flowers, or other
commodities of a “light,” and in some degree of
street estimation a “genteel” trade. Some of
the less laborious callings, however, such as that
in wash-leathers, are principally in the hands of
young and middle-aged Irishwomen, while that in
sheeps’-trotters, which does not entail heavy labour,
are in the hands mostly of elderly Irishwomen. The
sale of such things as lucifer-matches and water-cresses,
and any “stock” of general use, and attainable
for a few pence, is resorted to by the very
poor of every class. The Irishwoman more readily
unites begging with selling than the Englishwoman,
and is far more fluent and even eloquent;
perhaps she pays less regard to truth, but she
unquestionably pays a greater regard to chastity.
When the uneducated Irishwoman, however, has
fallen into licentious ways, she is, as I once heard
it expressed, the most “savagely wicked” of any.</p>

<p>After these broad distinctions I proceed to
details.</p>

<p>1. From the best information at my command it
may be affirmed that about one-half of the women
employed in the diverse trades of the streets, are
the wives or concubines (permanently or temporarily)
of the men who pursue a similar mode of
livelihood&mdash;the male street-sellers. I may here
observe that I was informed by an experienced
police-officer&mdash;who judged from his personal observation,
without any official or even systematic
investigation&mdash;that the women of the town, who
survived their youth or their middle age, did not
resort to the sale of any commodity in the streets,
but sought the shelter of the workhouse, or died,
he could not tell where or under what circumstances.
Of the verity of this statement I have
no doubt, as a street-sale entails some degree of
industry or of exertion, for which the life of those
wretched women may have altogether unfitted them.</p>

<p>In the course of the narratives and statements
I have given, it is shown that some wives pursue
one (itinerant or stationary) calling, while the
husband pursues another. The trades in which
the husband and wife (and I may here remark
that when I speak of “wives,” I include all,
so regarded in street life, whether legally united
or not)&mdash;the trades in which the woman is,
more than in any others, literally the help-mate
of the man, are the costermonger’s (including
the flower, or root, sellers) and the crockery-ware
people. To the costermonger some help is
often indispensable, and that of a wife is the
cheapest and the most honest (to say nothing of
the considerations connected with a home) which can
be obtained. Among the more prosperous costermongers
too, especially those who deal in fish,
the wife attends to the stall while the husband
goes “a round,” and thus a greater extent of
business is transacted. In the root and crockery-trades
the woman’s assistance is necessary when
barter takes place instead of sale, as the husband
may be ignorant of the value of the old female
attire which even “high-hip ladies,” as they
were described to me, loved to exchange for a
fuchsia or a geranium; for a glass cream-jug or a
china ornament. Of the married women engaged
in any street-trade, I believe nineteen-twentieths
are the wives of men also pursuing some street
avocation.</p>

<p>2. There are, however, large classes of female
street-sellers who may be looked upon as exceptions,
the wife selling in the streets while the husband
is engaged in some manual labour, but they
are only partially exceptions. In the sale of wash-leathers,
for instance, are the wives of many Irish
bricklayers’ labourers; the woman may be constantly
occupied in disposing of her wares in the
streets or suburbs, and the man labouring at any
building; but in case of the deprivation of work,
such a man will at once become a street-seller,
and in the winter many burly Irish labourers sell
a few nuts or “baked taties,” or a few pairs of
braces, or some article which seems little suitable
for the employment of men of thews and muscle.
In the course of my present inquiry I have, in
only very rare instances, met with a poor Irishman,
who had not a reason always at his tongue’s
end to justify anything he was doing. Ask a
bricklayer’s labourer why, in his youth and
strength, he is selling nuts, and he will at once
reply: “Sure thin, your honnur, isn’t it better
than doin’ nothing? I must thry and make a
pinny, ’til I’m in worruk again, and glory be
to God, I hope that’ll be soon.”</p>

<p>An experienced man, who knows all the street-folk
trading in Whitechapel and its neighbourhood,
and about Spitalfields, told me that he could count
up 100 married women, in different branches of
open-air commerce, and of them only two had
husbands who worked regularly in-doors. The
husband of one woman works for a slop-tailor,
the other is a bobbin turner; the tailor’s wife
sells water-cresses every morning and afternoon;
the turner’s wife is a “small-ware woman.” The
tailor, however, told my informant that his eyesight
was failing him, that his earnings became
less and less, that he was treated like dirt, and
would go into some street-trade himself before
long. When the man and his wife are both in
the street-trade, it is the case in three instances
out of four (excluding of course the costermongers,
root-sellers, and crock-man’s pursuits) that the
couple carry on different callings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>In the full and specific accounts I gave of the
largest body of street-sellers, viz., the costermongers,
I showed that concubinage among persons
of all ages was the rule, and marriage the exception.
It was computed that, taking the mass of costermongers,
only one couple in twenty, living together,
were married, except in Clerkenwell, where the
costers are very numerous, and where the respected
incumbent at certain seasons marries poor persons
gratuitously; there one couple in ten were really
man and wife.</p>

<p>Of the other classes of women street-sellers,
directly the reverse is the case; of those living
as man and wife, one couple in twenty may be
<i>unmarried</i>. An intelligent informant thought
this average too high, and that it was more
probably one in sixteen. But I incline to the
opinion of one in twenty, considering how many
of the street-traders have “seen better days,”
and were married before they apprehended being
driven to a street career. In this enumeration
I include only street-<i>traders</i>. Among such people
as ballad singers, concubinage, though its wrongfulness
is far better understood than among
ignorant costermongers, is practised even more
fully; and there is often among such classes even
worse than concubinage&mdash;a dependance, more or
less, on the wages of a woman’s prostitution,
and often a savage punishment to the wretched
woman, if those wages of sin are scant or
wanting.</p>

<p>3. The widows in the street-trades are very
generally the widows of street-sellers. I believe
that very few of the widows of mechanics, when
left unprovided for on their husbands’ demise,
resort to street traffic. If they have been needle-women
before marriage, they again seek for employment
at needle-work; if they have been servants,
they become charwomen, or washerwomen,
or again endeavour to obtain a livelihood in
domestic service.</p>

<p>There are some to whom those resources are
but starvation, or a step from starvation, or whom
they fail entirely, and then they “<i>must</i> try the
streets,” as they will describe it. If they are young
and reckless, they become prostitutes; if in more
advanced years, or with good principles, they
turn street-sellers; but this is only when destitution
presses sharply.</p>

<p>4. The single women in the street-callings are
generally the daughters of street-sellers, but their
number is not a twentieth of the others, excepting
they are the daughters of Irish parents. The costermongers’
daughters either help their parents, with
whom they reside, or carry on some similar trade;
or they soon form connections with the other sex,
and easily sever the parental tie, which very probably
has been far too lax or far too severe. I made
many inquiries, but I did not hear of any unmarried
young woman, not connected with street-folk
by birth or rearing, such as a servant maid,&mdash;endeavouring
to support herself when out of work
or place by a street avocation. Such a person will
starve on slop millinery or slop shirt-making; or
will, as much or more from desperation than
from viciousness, go upon the town. With the
Irish girls the case is different: brought up to a
street-life, used to whine and blarney, they grow
up to womanhood in street-selling, and as they
rarely form impure connections, and as no one may
be induced to offer them marriage, their life is
often one of street celibacy. A young Irishwoman,
to whom I was referred in the course of my
inquiry among fruit-sellers, had come to London
in the hopes of meeting her brother, with whom
she was to emigrate; but she could learn nothing
of him, and, concluding that he was dead, became
an apple-seller. She sat, when I saw her,
on cold wintry days, at the corner of a street in
the Commercial-road, seemingly as much dead as
alive, and slept with an aunt, also a single woman,
who was somewhat similarly circumstanced;
and thus these two women lived on about 6<i>d.</i> a
day each. Their joint bed was 1<i>s.</i> a week, and
they contrived to subsist on what remained when
this shilling was paid. The niece referred me,
not without a sense of pride, to her priest, as to
her observance of her religious duties, and declared
that where she lodged there were none but
women lodgers, and those chiefly her own countrywomen.
I believe such cases are not uncommon.
A few, who have had the education of
ladies (as in the case of an envelope-seller whose
statement I gave), are driven to street-trading, but
it is as a desperate grasp at something to supply
less bitter bread, however little of it, than is supplied
in the workhouse. I have many a time
heard poor women say: “God knows, sir, I should
live far better, and be better lodged and better
cared for in the house (they seldom call it workhouse),
but I’d rather live on 2<i>d.</i> a day.” Into
the question of out and in-door relief I need not
now enter, but the prevalent feeling I have indicated
is one highly honourable to the English poor.
I have heard it stated that the utter repugnance
to a workhouse existence was weaker than it used
to be among the poor, but I have not met with
anything to uphold such an opinion.</p>

<p>Such constitute the several classes of women
street-sellers. I shall now proceed to speak of the
habits and characters of this peculiar portion of
the street-folk.</p>

<p><i>As regards the religion</i> of the women in street-trades,
it is not difficult to describe it. The Irishwomen
are Roman Catholics. Perhaps I am justified
in stating that they are <i>all</i> of that faith. The
truth of this assertion is proved, moreover, to as
full a demonstration as it very well can be proved
without actual enumeration, by the fact that the
great majority of the Irishwomen in the streets are
from the Catholic provinces of Connaught, Leinster,
and Munster; there are very few from Ulster,
and not one-twentieth of the whole from any one of
the other provinces. Perhaps, again, it is not
extravagant to estimate that three-fourths of the
women and girls from the sister island, now selling
things in the streets, have been, when in their own
country, connected through their husbands or
parents with the cultivation of the land. It is
not so easy to speak of what the remaining fourth
were before they became immigrants. Some were
the wives of mechanics, who, when their husbands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
failing to obtain work in London became street-traders,
had adopted the same pursuits. I met
with one intelligent man having a stall of very
excellent fruit in Battle-bridge, who had been a
brogue-maker. He had been in business on his
own account in Tralee, but mended the indifferent
profits of brogue-making by a little trade in “dry
goods.” This, he told me with a cautious glance
around him and in a half whisper, though it
was twenty-eight years since he left his country,
meant smuggled tobacco. He found it advisable,
on account of being “wanted” by the revenue officers,
to leave Tralee in great haste. He arrived
in London, got employment as a bricklayer’s
labourer, and sent for his wife to join him. This
she did, and from her first arrival, sold fruit in the
streets. In two or three years the husband’s work
among the builders grew slack, and he then took to
the streets. Another man, a shoemaker, who came
from Dublin to obtain work in London, as he was
considered “a good hand,” could not obtain it,
but became a street-seller, and <i>his</i> wife, previously
to himself, had resorted to a street-trade in fruit.
He became a widower and married as “his second,”
the daughter of an Irish carpenter who had been disappointed
in emigrating from London, and whose
whole family had become fruit-sellers. A third
man, who had worked at his trade of a tailor
in Cork, Waterford, Wicklow, and Dublin (he
“tramped” from Cork to Dublin) had come
to London and been for many years a street-seller
in different capacities. His wife and
daughter now assist him, or trade independently,
in selling “roots.” “Rayther,” this man said,
“than put up wid the wages and the <i>ter-ratement</i>
(said very emphatically) o’ thim slop masters at
the Aist Ind, I’d sill myself as a slave. The
sthraits doesn’t degrade a man like thim thieves
o’ the worruld.” This man knew, personally, ten
Irish mechanics who were street-sellers in London,
as were their wives and families, including some
five-and-twenty females.</p>

<p>I adduce these and the following details somewhat
minutely, as they tend to show by what
class of Irish immigrants the streets of the imperial
metropolis are stocked with so large a body of
open-air traders.</p>

<p>There is also another class of women who, I am
informed on good authority, sometimes become
street-sellers, though I met with no instance myself.
The orphan children of poor Irish parents
are, on the demise of their father and mother sometimes
taken into a workhouse and placed out as
domestic servants. So, as regards domestic servants,
are the daughters of Irish labourers, by
their friends or the charitable. As the wages of
these young girls are small and sometimes nominal,
the work generally hard, and in no few instances
the food scanty and the treatment severe, domestic
service becomes distasteful, and a street life “on a
few oranges and limmons” is preferred. There is,
moreover, with some of this class another cause
which almost compels the young Irish girl into the
adoption of some street calling. A peevish mistress,
whose numerous family renders a servant necessary,
but whose means are small or precarious,
becomes bitterly dissatisfied with the awkwardness
or stupidity of her Irish handmaiden; the
girl’s going, or “teasing to go,” every Sunday
morning to mass is annoying, and the girl is often
discharged, or discharges herself “in a huff.” The
mistress, perhaps, with the low tyranny dear to
vulgar minds, refuses her servant a character, or,
in giving one, suppresses any good qualities, and
exaggerates the failings of impudence, laziness,
lying, and dirtiness. Thus the girl cannot obtain
another situation, and perforce perhaps she becomes
a street-seller.</p>

<p>The readiness with which young Irish people
thus adapt themselves to all the uncertainties and
hardships of a street life is less to be wondered at
when we consider that the Irish live together, or
at any rate associate with one another, in this
country, preserving their native tastes, habits, and
modes of speech. Among their tastes and habits,
a dislike to a street life does not exist as it does
among English girls.</p>

<p>The poor Irish females in London are for the
most part regular in their attendance at mass, and
this constant association in their chapels is one
of the links which keeps the street-Irish women
so much distinct from the street-English. In the
going to and returning from the Roman Catholic
chapels, there is among these people&mdash;I was told
by one of the most intelligent of them&mdash;a talk of
family and secular matters,&mdash;of the present too
high price of oranges to leave full 6<i>d.</i> a day at two
a penny, and the probable time when cherries
would be “in” and cheap, “plaze God to prosper
them.” In these colloquies there is an absence of
any interference by English street-sellers, and an
unity of conversation and interest peculiarly Irish.
It is thus that the tie of religion, working with
the other causes, keeps the Irish in the London
streets knitted to their own ways, and is likely to
keep them so, and, perhaps, to add to their
number.</p>

<p>It was necessary to write somewhat at length of
so large a class of women who <i>are</i> professors of a religion,
but of the others the details may be brief;
for, as to the great majority, religion is almost a
nonentity. For this absence of religious observances,
the women street-sellers make many, and
sometimes, I must confess, valiant excuses. They
must work on a Sunday morning, they will
say, or they can’t eat; or else they tell you,
they are so tired by knocking about all the
week that they must rest on a Sunday; or
else they have no clothes to go to church in,
and ar’n’t a-going there just to be looked down
upon and put in any queer place as if they had a
fever, and for ladies to hold their grand dresses
away from them as they walked in to their grand
pews. Then, again, some assert they are not used
to sit still for so long a time, and so fall asleep.
I have heard all these causes assigned as reasons
for not attending church or chapel.</p>

<p>A few women street-sellers, however, <i>do</i> attend
the Sunday service of the Church of England.
One lace-seller told me that she did so because it
obliged Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who was the best friend and
customer she had, and who always looked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
her pew in the gallery to see who were on the
poor seats. A few others, perhaps about an equal
number, attend dissenting places of worship of the
various denominations&mdash;the Methodist chapels
comprising more than a half. If I may venture
upon a calculation founded on the result of my
inquiries, and on the information of others who
felt an interest in the matter, I should say that
about five female street-sellers attended Protestant
places of worship, in the ratio of a hundred attending
the Roman Catholic chapels.</p>

<p><i>The localities in which the female street-sellers
reside</i> are those (generally) which I have often had
occasion to specify as the abodes of the poor. They
congregate principally, however, in the neighbourhood
of some street-market. The many courts in
Ray-street, Turnmill-street, Cow-cross, and other
parts of Clerkenwell, are full of street-sellers, especially
costermongers, some of those costermongers
being also drovers. Their places of sale are in
Clerkenwell-green, Aylesbury-street, and St. John-street.
Others reside in Vine-street (late Mutton-hill),
Saffron-hill, Portpool Lane, Baldwin’s-gardens,
and the many streets or alleys stretching
from Leather-lane to Gray’s-inn-lane, with a few
of the better sort in Cromer-street. Their chief
mart is Leather-lane, now one of the most crowded
markets in London. The many who use the Brill
as their place of street-traffic, reside in Brill-row,
in Ossulston-street, Wilstead-street, Chapel-street,
and in the many small intersecting lanes and
alleys connected with those streets, and in other
parts of Somers-town. The saleswomen in the
Cripplegate street-markets, such as Whitecross-street,
Fore-street, Golden-lane, &amp;c., reside in
Play-house-yard, and in the thick congregation of
courts and alleys, approximating to Aldersgate-street,
Fore-street, Bunhill-row, Chiswell-street,
Barbican, &amp;c., &amp;c. Advancing eastward, the
female street-sellers in Shoreditch (including the
divisions of the Bishopsgate-streets Within and Without,
Norton Folgate, and Holywell-street) reside
in and about Artillery-lane, Half-moon-street, and
the many narrow “clefts” (as they are called in
one of Leigh Hunt’s essays) stretching on the
right hand as you proceed along Bishopsgate-street,
from its junction with Cornhill; “clefts” which,
on my several visits, have appeared to me as among
the foulest places in London. On the left-hand
side, proceeding in the same direction, the street-sellers
reside in Long-alley, and the many yards
connected with that, perhaps narrowest, in proportion
to its length, of any merely pedestrian thoroughfare
in London. Mixed with the poor street-sellers
about Long-alley, I may observe, are a mass of the
tailors and shoemakers employed by the east-end
slop-masters; they are principally Irish workmen,
carrying on their crafts many in one room, to
economise the rent, while some of their wives are
street-sellers.</p>

<p>The street-sellers in Spitalfields and Bethnal-green
are so mixed up as to their abodes with the
wretchedly underpaid cabinet-makers who supply
the “slaughter-houses;” with slop-employed
tailors and shoemakers (in the employ of a class,
as respects shoemakers, known as “garret-masters”
or middle-men, between the workman
and the wholesale warehouse-man), bobbin-turners,
needle-women, slop-milliners, &amp;c., that I might
tediously enumerate almost every one of the many
streets known, emphatically enough, as the “poor
streets.” These poor streets are very numerous,
running eastward from Shoreditch to the Cambridge-road,
and southward from the Bethnal-green-road
to Whitechapel and the Mile End-road.
The female street-sellers in Whitechapel live in
Wentworth-street, Thrawl-street, Osborne-street,
George-yard, and in several of their interminglements
with courts and narrow streets. The
Petticoat-lane street-dealers are generally Jews,
and live in the poorer Jewish quarters, in Petticoat-lane
and its courts, and in the streets
running on thence to Houndsditch. Rosemary-lane
has many street-sellers, but in the lane itself
and its many yards and blind alleys they find
their domiciles. Westward in the metropolis one
of the largest street-markets is in Tottenham-court-road;
and in the courts between Fitzroy-market
and Tottenham-court-road are the rooms of the
women vending their street goods. Those occupying
the Hampstead-road with their stalls&mdash;which
is but a continuation of the Tottenham-court-road
market&mdash;live in the same quarters.
In what is generally called the St. George’s-market,
meaning the stalls at the western extremity
of Oxford-street, the women who own
those stalls reside in and about Thomas-street,
Tom’s-court, and the wretched places&mdash;the very
existence of which is perhaps unknown to
their aristocratic neighbourhood&mdash;about Grosvenor-square;
some of them lamentably wretched
places. It might be wearisome to carry on this
enumeration further. It may suffice to observe,
that in the populous parts of Southwark,
Lambeth, and Newington, wherever there is a
street-market, are small or old streets inhabited
by the street-sellers, and at no great distance.
From the Obelisk at the junction, or approximate
junction, of the Westminster, Waterloo, Blackfriars,
Borough, and London-roads, in pretty well
every direction to the banks of the Thames, are
a mass of private-looking streets&mdash;as far as the
absence of shops constitutes the privacy of a street&mdash;old
and half-ruinous, or modern and trim, in all of
which perhaps may be found street-sellers, and in
some of which are pickpockets, thieves, and prostitutes.</p>

<p>Of course it must be understood that these
specified localities are the residence of the male,
as well as the female street-sellers, both adults
and children.</p>

<p>The proportion of female street-traders who
reside in lodging-houses may be estimated at
one-tenth of the entire number. This may appear
a small proportion, but it must be remembered
that the costermongering women do not reside in
lodging-houses&mdash;so removing the largest class of
street-folk from the calculation of the numbers
thus accommodated&mdash;and that the Irish who
pursue street callings with any regularity generally
prefer living, if it be two or three families in
a room, in a place of their own. The female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
street-folk sleeping in lodging-houses, and occasionally
taking their meals there, are usually those
who are itinerant; the women who have a settled
trade, especially a “pitch,” reside in preference in
some “place of their own.” Of the number in
lodging-houses one half may be regular inmates,
some having a portion of a particular room to
themselves; the others are casual sojourners,
changing their night’s shelter as convenience
prompts.</p>

<p>Of the female street-sellers residing in houses
of ill fame there are not many; perhaps not many
more than 100. I was told by a gentleman whose
connection with parochial matters enabled him to
form an opinion, that about Whitecross-street,
and some similar streets near the Cornwall-road,
and stretching away to the Blackfriars and
Borough-roads&mdash;(the locality which of any in
London is perhaps the most rank with prostitution
and its attendant evils)&mdash;there might be 600
of those wretched women and of all ages, from 15
to upwards of 40; and that among them he believed
there were barely a score who occupied themselves
with street-sale. Of women, and more especially
of girl, street-sellers, such as flower-girls, those
pursuing immoral courses are far more numerous
than 100, but they do not often reside in houses
notoriously of ill-fame, but in their own rooms
(and too often with their parents) and in low
lodging-houses. For women who are street-sellers,
without the practice of prostitution, to reside in a
house of ill-fame, would be a reckless waste of
money; as I am told that in so wretched a street
as White-horse-street, the rent of a front kitchen
is 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week; of a back kitchen, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; of a
front parlour, 6<i>s.</i>; and of a back parlour, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
all being meagrely furnished and very small.
This is also accounted one of the cheapest of all
such streets. The rent of a street-seller’s unfurnished
room is generally 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or even 1<i>s.</i>
a week; a furnished room is 3<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>The state of education</i> among the female street-sellers
is very defective. Perhaps it may be
said that among the English costers not one
female in twenty can read, and not one in
forty can write. But they are fond of listening
to any one who reads the newspaper or
any exciting story. Among the street-selling
Irish, also, education is very defective. As regards
the adults, who have been of woman’s
estate before they left Ireland, a knowledge of
reading and writing may be as rare as among
the English costerwomen; but with those who
have come to this country sufficiently young, or
have been born here, education is far more
diffused than among the often more prosperous
English street children. This is owing to the
establishment of late years of many Roman
Catholic schools, at charges suited to the poor, or
sometimes free, and of the Irish parents having
availed themselves (probably on the recommendation
of the priest) of such opportunities for the
tuition of their daughters, which the English
costers have neglected to do with equal chances.
Of the other classes whom I have specified as
street-sellers, I believe I may say that the education
of the females is about the average of that of
“servants of all work” who have been brought up
amidst struggles and poverty; they can read, but
with little appreciation of what they read, and have
therefore little taste for books, and often little
leisure even if they have taste. As to writing, a
woman told me that at one time, when she was “in
place,” and kept weekly accounts, she had been complimented
by her mistress on her neat hand, but
that she and her husband (a man of indifferent
character) had been street-sellers for seven or eight
years, and during all that time she had only once
had a pen in her hand; this was a few weeks back,
in signing a petition&mdash;something about Sundays,
she said&mdash;she wrote her name with great pain and
difficulty, and feared that she had not even spelled
it aright! I may here repeat that I found the
uneducated always ready to attribute their want
of success in life to their want of education; while
the equally poor street-sellers, who were “scholars,”
are as apt to say, “It’s been of no manner of use
to me.” In all these matters I can but speak
generally. The male street-sellers who have seen
better days have of course been better educated,
but the most intelligent of the street class are the
patterers, and of them the females form no portion.</p>

<p><i>The diet of the class</i> I am describing is, as regards
its poorest members, tea and bread or bread and
grease; a meal composed of nothing else is their
fare twice or thrice a day. Sometimes there is
the addition of a herring&mdash;or a plaice, when plaice
are two a penny&mdash;but the consumption of cheap
fish, with a few potatoes, is more common among
the poor Irish than the poor English female street-sellers.
“Indeed, sir,” said an elderly woman,
who sold cakes of blacking and small wares, “I
could make a meal on fish and potatoes, cheaper
than on tea and bread and butter, though I don’t
take milk with my tea&mdash;I’ve got to like it better
without milk than with it&mdash;but if you’re a long
time on your legs in the streets and get to your
bit of a home for a cup of tea, you want a bit of
rest over it, and if you have to cook fish it’s such
a trouble. O, no, indeed, this time of year there’s
no ’casion to light a fire for your tea&mdash;and tea
’livens you far more nor a herring&mdash;because there’s
always some neighbour to give a poor woman a
jug of boiling water.” Married women, who may
carry on a trade distinct from that of their husbands,
live as well as their earnings and the
means of the couple will permit: what they consider
good living is a dinner daily off “good block
ornaments” (small pieces of meat, discoloured and
dirty, but not tainted, usually set for sale on the
butcher’s block), tripe, cow-heel, beef-sausages, or
soup from a cheap cook-shop, “at 2<i>d.</i> a pint.”
To this there is the usual accompaniment of beer,
which, in all populous neighbourhoods, is “3<i>d.</i>
a pot (quart) in your own jugs.” From what I
could learn, it seems to me that an inordinate or
extravagant indulgence of the palate, under any
circumstances, is far less common among the
female than the male street-sellers.</p>

<p>During the summer and the fine months of the
spring and autumn, there are, I am assured, one-third
of the London street-sellers&mdash;male and female&mdash;“tramping”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the country. At Maidstone Fair the
other day, I was told by an intelligent itinerant
dealer, there were 300 women, all of whose faces
he believed he had seen at one time or other in
London. The Irish, however, tramp very little
into the country for purposes of trade, but they
travel in great numbers from one place to another
for purposes of mendicancy; or, if they have a
desire to emigrate, they will tramp from London
to Liverpool, literally begging their way, no
matter whether they have or have not any money.
The female street-sellers are thus a fluctuating
body.</p>

<p>The beggars among the women who profess to
be street-traders are chiefly Irishwomen, some of
whom, though otherwise well-conducted, sober
and chaste, beg shamelessly and with any mendacious
representation. It is remarkable enough,
too, that of the Irishwomen who will thus beg,
many if employed in any agricultural work, or
in the rougher household labours, such as scouring
or washing, will work exceedingly hard. To
any feeling of self-respect or self-dependence, however,
they seem dead; their great merit is their
chastity, their great shame their lying and mendicancy.</p>

<p>The female street-sellers are again a fluctuating
body, as in the summer and autumn months. A
large proportion go off to work in market-gardens,
in the gathering of peas, beans, and the several
fruits; in weeding, in hay-making, in the corn-harvest
(when they will endeavour to obtain leave
to glean if they are unemployed more profitably),
and afterwards in the hopping. The women, however,
thus seeking change of employment, are the
ruder street-sellers, those who merely buy oranges
at 4<i>d.</i> to sell at 6<i>d.</i>, and who do not meddle with
any calling mixed up with the necessity of skill
in selection, or address in recommending. Of
this half-vagrant class, many are not street-sellers
usually, but are half prostitutes and half thieves,
not unfrequently drinking all their earnings, while
of the habitual female street-sellers, I do not think
that drunkenness is now a very prevalent vice.
Their earnings are small, and if they become
habituated to an indulgence in drink, their means
are soon dissipated; in which case they are unable
to obtain stock-money, and they cease to be street-sellers.</p>

<p>If I may venture upon an estimation, I should
say that the women engaged in street sale&mdash;wives,
widows, and single persons&mdash;number from
25,000 to 30,000, and that their average earnings
run from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to give the histories of
individuals belonging to each of the above class of
female street-sellers, with the view of illustrating
what has been said respecting them generally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Single Woman, as a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>I had some difficulty, for the reasons I have
stated, in finding a single woman who, by her
unaided industry, supported herself on the sale
of street merchandise. There were plenty of
single young women so engaged, but they lived,
or lodged, with their parents or with one parent,
or they had some support, however trifling, from
some quarter or other. Among the street Irish
I could have obtained statements from many
single women who depended on their daily sale
for their daily bread, but I have already given
instances of their street life. One Irishwoman,
a spinster of about 50, for I had some conversation
with her in the course of a former
inquiry, had supported herself alone, by street
sale, for many years. She sat, literally packed in
a sort of hamper-basket, at the corner of Charles-street,
Leather-lane. She seemed to fit herself
cross-legged, like a Turk, or a tailor on his shop-board,
into her hamper; her fruit stall was close
by her, and there she seemed to doze away life
day by day&mdash;for she usually appeared to be wrapped
in slumber. If any one approached her stall, however,
she seemed to be awake, as it were, mechanically.
I have missed this poor woman of late, and I
believe she only packed herself up in the way
described when the weather was cold.</p>

<p>A woman of about 26 or 27&mdash;I may again
remark that the regular street-sellers rarely know
their age&mdash;made the following statement. She was
spare and sickly looking, but said that her health
was tolerably good.</p>

<p>“I used to mind my mother’s stall,” she stated,
“when I was a girl, when mother wasn’t well or
had a little work at pea-shelling or such like. She
sold sweet-stuff. No, she didn’t make it, but
bought it. I never cared for it, and when I was
quite young I’ve sold sweet-stuffs as I never tasted.
I never had a father. I can’t read or write, but
I like to hear people read. I go to Zion Chapel
sometimes of a Sunday night, the singing’s so nice.
I don’t know what religion you may call it of, but
it’s a Zion Chapel. Mother’s been dead these&mdash;well
I don’t know how long, but it’s a long time.
I’ve lived by myself ever since, and kept myself,
and I have half a room with another young woman
who lives by making little boxes. I don’t know
what sort of boxes. Pill-boxes? Very likely, sir,
but I can’t say I ever saw any. She goes out to
work on another box-maker’s premises. She’s no
better off nor me. We pays 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a-week
between us; it’s my bed, and the other sticks is
her’n. We ’gree well enough. I haven’t sold
sweet stuff for a great bit. I’ve sold small
wares in the streets, and artificials (artificial
flowers), and lace, and penny dolls, and penny
boxes (of toys). No, I never hear anything
improper from young men. Boys has sometimes
said, when I’ve been selling sweets, ‘Don’t look
so hard at ’em, or they’ll turn sour.’ I never
minded such nonsense. I has very few amusements.
I goes once or twice a month, or so, to
the gallery at the Wick (Victoria Theatre), for I
live near. It’s beautiful there. O, it’s really
grand. I don’t know what they call what’s played,
because I can’t read the bills.</p>

<p>“I hear what they’re called, but I forgets. I
knows Miss Vincent and John Herbert when they
come on. I likes them the best. I’m a going
to leave the streets. I have an aunt a laundress,
because she was mother’s sister, and I always
helped her, and she taught me laundressing. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
work for her three and sometimes four days a-week
now, because she’s lost her daughter Ann, and
I’m known as a good ironer. Another laundress
will employ me next week, so I’m dropping the
streets, as I can do far better. I’m not likely to
be married and I don’t want to.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Mechanic’s Wife, as a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>A middle-aged woman, presenting what may
be best understood as a decency of appearance,
for there was nothing remarkable in her face or
dress, gave me the following account of her experience
as a street-seller, and of her feelings when
she first became <span class="lock">one:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I went into service very young in the country,”
she said, “but mistress brought me up to
London with her, where master had got a situation:
the children was so fond of me. I saved a
little money in that and other places as girls often
does, and they seems not to save it so much for
themselves as for others. Father got the first bit
of money I saved, or he would have been seized
for rent&mdash;he was only a working man (agricultural
labourer)&mdash;and all the rest I scraped went
before I’d been married a fortnight, for I got
married when I was 24. O no, indeed, I
don’t mean that my money was wasted by my
husband. It was every farthing laid out in the
house, besides what he had, for we took a small
house in a little street near the Commercial-road,
and let out furnished rooms. We did very well
at first with lodgings, but the lodgers were mates
of vessels, or people about the river and the docks,
and they were always coming and going, and the
rooms was often empty, and some went away in
debt. My husband is a smith, and was in middling
work for a good while. Then he got a job
to go with some horses to France, for he can groom
a horse as well as shoe it, and he was a long time
away, three or four months, for he was sent into
another country when he got to France, but I
don’t understand the particulars of it. The rooms
was empty and the last lodger went away without
paying, and I had nothing to meet the quarter’s
rent, and the landlord, all of a sudden almost, put
in the brokers, for he said my husband would
never come back, and perhaps I should be selling
the furniture and be off to join him, for he
told me it was all a planned thing he knew.
And so the furniture was sold for next to
nothing, and 1<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> was given to me after
the sale; I suppose that was over when all was
paid, but I’d been forced to part with some
linen and things to live upon and pay the rates,
that came very heavy. My husband came back
to an empty house three days after, and he’d been
unlucky, for he brought home only 4<i>l.</i> instead of
10<i>l.</i> at least, as he expected, but he’d been cheated
by the man he went into the other country with.
Yes, the man that cheated him was an Englishman,
and my poor John was put to great trouble and expense,
and was in a strange place without knowing
a word of the language. But the foreigners
was very kind to him, he said, and didn’t laugh
at him when he tried to make hisself understood,
as I’ve seen people do here many a time. The
landlord gave us 1<i>l.</i> to give up the house, as he
had a good offer for it, and so we had to start
again in the world like.</p>

<p>“Our money was almost all gone before John
got regular work, tho’ he had some odd jobs, and
then he had for a good many months the care of
a horse and cart for a tradesman in the City.
Shortly after that he was laid up a week with a
crushed leg, but his master wouldn’t wait a week
for him, so he hired another: ‘I have nothing to
say against John,’ says he, when I told his master
of the accident, ‘and I’m sorry, very sorry, but my
business can’t be hindered by waiting for people
getting better of accidents.’ John got work at his
own business next, but there was always some
stopper. He was ill, or I was ill, and if there was
10<i>s.</i> in the house, then it went and wasn’t enough.
And so we went on for a good many years, I don’t
know how many. John kept working among
horses and carts, or at his own business, but what
with travelling abroad, I suppose, and such like,
he got to like best to be in the streets, and he has
his health best that way.” (The husband, it is
evident, was afflicted with the restlessness of the
tribe.) “About seven years ago we were very
badly off&mdash;no work, and no money, and neither of
us well. Then I used to make a few women’s
plain night-caps and plain morning caps for servants,
and sell them to a shopkeeper, but latterly I couldn’t
sell them at all, or get no more than the stuff cost
me, without any profit for labour. So at last&mdash;and
it was on a Friday evening of all unlucky
times&mdash;my gold wedding-ring that cost 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and that I’d stuck to all along, had to be pawned
for 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for rent and bread. That <i>was</i> a shocking
time, sir. We’ve sat in the dark of an evening,
for we could get neither coals nor a candle as
we was a little in debt, and John said, it was a
blessing after all perhaps that we hadn’t no family,
for he often, both joking and serious, wished for
children, but it wasn’t God’s will you see that we
should have any. One morning when I woke very
early I found my husband just going out, and when
I asked him what sent him out so soon, he says:
‘It’s for nothing bad, so don’t fret yourself, old
gal.’ That day he walked all over London and
called on all the masters as had employed him, or
knowed him, and told them how he was situated,
and said that if he could borrow 20<i>s.</i> up and down,
he could do a little, he knew&mdash;the thought of
it came into his mind all of a sudden&mdash;in going
about with a horse and cart, that he could hire,
and sell coals to poor people. He raised 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
I think it was, and started with a quarter of a
ton of coals, and then another quarter when the
first was sold, and he carried it on for three or
four weeks. But the hire of the horse and cart
took all the profit, and the poor people wanted
credit, besides people must cheat to thrive as sells
coals in the street. All this time I could do nothing&mdash;though
I tried for washing and charing, but I’m
slow at washing&mdash;but starve at home, and be afraid
every knock was the landlord. After that John
was employed to carry a very heavy board over
his shoulder, and so as to have it read on both
sides. It was about an eating-house, and I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
with him to give little bills about it to all we met,
for it was as much as a man could do to carry the
board. He had 1<i>s.</i> a day, and I had 6<i>d.</i> That
was my first time in the streets and I felt so
’shamed to come to that. I thought if I met any
people I knew in Essex, or any of my old mistresses,
what would they think. Then we had
all sorts of jokes to stand. We both looked
pinched, and young gents used to say, ‘Do you
dine there yourselves?’ and the boys&mdash;O, of all
the torments!&mdash;they’ve shouted out, ‘Excellent
Dining-rooms’ that was on the board, sir, ‘and
two jolly speciments of the style of grub!’ I
could have knocked their saucy heads together.
We was resting in the shade one day&mdash;and we
were anxious to do our best, for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day was
a great thing then&mdash;and an old gentleman came up
and said he was glad to get out of the sun. He
looked like a parson, but was a joky man, and
he’d been having some wine, I think, he smelled
of it so. He began to talk to us and ask us
questions, such as you have, sir, and we told him
how we was situated. ‘God bless you,’ says he,
‘for I think you’re honest folks. People that lie
don’t talk like you; here’s some loose silver I
have,’ and he gave John 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and went away.
We could hardly think it was real; it seemed such
a lot of money just then, to be got clear all at once.
I’ve never seen him since, and never saw him, as
I knows of, before, but may God Almighty bless
him wherever he is, for I think that 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
put new life into us, and brought a blessing. A
relation of John’s came to London not long after
and gave him a sovereign and sent him some old
clothes, and very good ones, when he went back.
Then John hired a barrow&mdash;it’s his own now&mdash;and
started as a costermonger. A neighbour of
ourn told him how to do it, and he’s done very
well at it since.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, sir, I could’nt like to stay at
home by myself doing of a nothing, and I couldn’t
get any charing; besides John says, ‘Why, can’t
<i>you</i> sell something?’ So I made some plain
women’s caps, and as we lived in Ann’s-place,
Waterloo-road, then, I went into the New Cut
with them on a Saturday night. But there was
such crowding, and shoving, and shouting, that
I was kept under and sold only one cap. I
was very much nervoused before I went and
thought again&mdash;it was very foolish, I know&mdash;‘if
I saw anybody from Essex,’ for country people
seem to think all their friends in London are
making fortunes! Before I went my landlady
<i>would</i> treat me to a little drop of gin to give me
spirits, and ‘for luck,’ but I think it made me
more nervoused. I very seldom taste any. And
John’s very good that way. He takes his pint or
two every now and then, but I know where he
uses, and if it gets late I go for him and he comes
home. The next time I went to sell in the Cut
I got bold, for I knew I was doing nothing but
what was honest; I’ve sold caps, and millinery,
and laces, and artificial flowers, and such like ever
since. We’ve saved a little money now, which is
in the bank, thank God, but that’s not done by
costering, or by my trade. But my husband buys
a poney every now and then, and grooms and
fattens it up well, and makes it quite another
thing, and so clears a pound or two; he once
cleared 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> on it. We don’t go to church or
chapel on a Sunday, we’re so tired out after the
week’s work. But John reads a tract that a young
lady leaves ’till he falls asleep over it.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of an Irishwoman, as a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>I have before had occasion to remark the aptitude
of the poor Irish in the streets of London not so
much to lie, which may be too harsh a word when
motives and idiosyncrasy are considered, but to
exaggerate, and misrepresent, and colour in such
a way that the truth becomes a mere incident in
the narrative, instead of being the animating
principle throughout. I speak here not as regards
any direct question or answer on one specific
point, but as regards a connected statement. Presuming
that a poor Irishwoman, for instance, had
saved up a few shillings, very likely for some
laudable purpose, and had them hidden about her
person, and was asked if she had a farthing in
the world, she would reply with a look of most
stolid innocence, “Sorra a fardin, sir.” This of
course is an unmitigated lie. Then ask her <i>why</i>
she is so poor and what are her hopes for the
future, and a very slender substratum of truth
will suffice for the putting together of a very
ingenious history, if she think the occasion requires
it.</p>

<p>It is the same when these poor persons are
questioned as to their former life. They have
heard of societies to promote emigration, and if
they fancy that any inquiries are made of them
with a view to emigration, they will ingeniously
shape their replies so as to promote or divert that
object, according to their wishes. If they think
the inquiries are for some charitable purpose, their
tale of woe and starvation is heart-rending. The
probability is that they may have suffered much,
and long, and bravely, but they will still exaggerate.
In one thing, however, I have found
them understate the fact, and that I believe principally,
or wholly, when they had been previously
used to the most wretched of the Irish hovels. I
mean as to their rooms. “Where do you live,”
may be asked. “Will, thin, in Paraker-street
(Parker-street) Derwry-lane?” “Have you a
decent room?” “Shure, thin, and it is dacint
for a poor woman.” On a visit, perhaps the
room will be found smoky, filthy, half-ruinous,
and wretched in every respect. I believe, however,
that if these poor people could be made
to comprehend the motives which caused their
being questioned for the purposes of this work,
the elucidation of the truth&mdash;motives which they
cannot be made to understand&mdash;they would speak
with a far greater regard to veracity. But they
<i>will</i> suspect an ulterior object, involving some
design on the part of the querist, and they will
speak accordingly. To what causes, social or
political, national, long-rooted, or otherwise, this
spirit may be owing, it is not now my business to
inquire.</p>

<p>At the outset of my inquiries amongst the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
Irish, whose civility and often native politeness,
where there is a better degree of intelligence,
makes it almost impossible to be angry with them
even when you listen to a story of which you
believe not one-sixth&mdash;at the outset of my inquiries,
I say, I was told by an Irish gentleman that I
was sure to hear the truth if I had authority to
use the name of their priest. I readily obtained
the consent of reverend gentlemen to use their
names and for any purpose of inquiry, a courtesy
which I thankfully acknowledge. I mention this
more especially, that it may not be thought that
there has been exaggeration in my foregoing or in
the following statement, where the Irish are the
narrators. I have little doubt of their truth.</p>

<p>It may be but proper to remark, in order that
one class of poor people may not be unduly <i>depreciated</i>,
while another class is, perhaps, unduly <i>appreciated</i>,
that the poor Irishman is much more
imaginative, is readier of wit and far readier of
speech, than an Englishman of a corresponding
grade; and were the untaught Englishman
equally gifted in those respects, who will avouch
that <i>his</i> regard for the truth would be much more
severe?</p>

<p>Of the causes which induced a good-looking
Irish woman to become a street-seller I had the
following account, which I give in its curious
<span class="lock">details:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“’Deed thin, sir, it’s more than 20 long years
since I came from Dublin to Liverpool wid my
father and mother, and brother William that’s
dead and gone, rest his soul. He died when he
was fourteen. They was masons in Ireland.
Was both father and mother masons, sir? Well,
then, in any quiet job mother helped father, for
she was a strong woman. They came away
sudden. They was in some thrubble, but I never
knew what, for they wouldn’t talk to me about it.
We thravelled from Liverpool to London, for there
was no worruk at Liverpool; and he got worruk
on buildings in London, and had 18<i>s.</i> a week; and
mother cleaned and worruked for a greengrocer, as
they called him&mdash;he sold coals more than anything&mdash;where
we lodged, and it wasn’t much, she
got, but she airned what is such a thrubble to
poor people, the rint. We was well off, and
I was sent to school; and we should have been
better off, but father took too much to the dhrop,
God save him. He fell onste and broke his leg;
and though the hospital gintlemen, God bless them
for good Christians, got him through it, he got
little worruk when he came out again, and died in
less than a year. Mother wasn’t long afther
him; and on her death-bed she said, so low I
could hardly hear her, ‘Mary, my darlint, if
you starruve, be vartuous. Rimimber poor Illen’s
funeral.’ When I was quite a child, sir, I went
wid mother to a funeral&mdash;she was a relation&mdash;and
it was of a young woman that died after her child
had been borrun a fortnight, and she wasn’t married;
that was Illen. Her body was brought out
of the lying-in hospital&mdash;I’ve often heard spake
of it since&mdash;and was in the churchyard to be
buried; and her brother, that hadn’t seen her for
a long time, came and wanted to see her in her
coffin, and they took the lid off, and then he
currused her in her coffin afore him; she’d been so
wicked. But he wasn’t a good man hisself, and
was in dhrink too; still nobody said anything, and
he walked away. It made me ill to see Illen in
her coffin, and hear him curruse, and I’ve remimbered
it ever since.</p>

<p>“I was thin fifteen, I believe, and hadn’t any
friends that had any tie to me. I was lone, sir.
But the neebours said, ‘Poor thing, she’s left on
the shuckrawn’ (homeless); and they helped me,
and I got a place. Mistress was very kind at
first, that’s my first mistress was, and I had the
care of a child of three years old; they had only
one, because mistress was busy making waistcoats.
Master was a hatter, and away all day, and they
was well off. But some women called on mistress
once, and they had a deal of talkin’, and bladherin’,
and laughin’, and I don’t know how
often I was sent out for quarterns of gin. Then
they all went out together; and mistress came
home quite tipsy just afore master, and went up-stairs,
and had just time to get into bed; she
told me to tell master she had one of her sick
head-aches and was forced to go to bed; she
went on that way for three or four days, and
master and she used to quarrel of a night, for I
could hear them. One night he came home
sooner than common, and he’d been drinking, or
perhaps it might be thrubble, and he sent me to
bed wid the child; and sometime in the night, I
don’t know what time, but I could only see from
a gas-lamp that shined into the room, he came
in, for there was no fastenin’ inside the door, it
was only like a closet, and he began to ask me
about mistress. When he larned she’d been
drinking wid other women, he used dreadful language,
and pulled me out of bed, and struck me
with a stick that he snatched up, he could see it
in the gas-light, it was little Frank’s horse, and
swore at me for not telling him afore. He only
struck me onste, but I screamed ever so often, I
was so frightened. I dressed myself, and lay
down in my clothes, and got up as soon as it
was light&mdash;it was summer time&mdash;and thought I
would go away and complain to some one. I
would ask the neebours who to complain to.
When I was going out there was master walking
up and down the kitchen. He’d never
been to bed, and he says, says he, ‘Mary,
where are you going?’ So I told him, and he
begged my pardon, and said he was ashamed of
what he’d done, but he was half mad; then he
began to cry, and so I cried, and mistress came
home just then, and when she saw us both crying
together, <i>she</i> cried, and said she wasn’t wanted, as
we was man and wife already. Master just gave
her a push and down she fell, and he ran out.
She seemed so bad, and the child began to cry,
that I couldn’t lave thin; and master came home
drunk that night, but he wasn’t cross, for he’d
made out that mistress had been drinking with
some neebours, and had got to her mother’s, and
that she was so tipsy she fell asleep, they let her
stay till morning, and then some woman set her
home, but she’d been there all night. They made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
it up at last, but I wouldn’t stay. They was very
kind to me when I left, and paid me all that was
owing, and gave me a good pair of shoes, too; for
they was well off.</p>

<p>“I had a many places for seven years; after
that, and when I was out of a place, I stayed wid
a widder, and a very dacint woman, she was wid
a daughter working for a bookbinder, and the old
woman had a good pitch with fruit. Some of my
places was very harrud, but shure, again, I met
some as was very kind. I left one because they
was always wanting me to go to a Methodist
chapel, and was always running down my religion,
and did all they could to hinder my ever going
to mass. They would hardly pay me when I
left, because I wouldn’t listen to them, they said&mdash;the
haythens!&mdash;when they would have saved
my soul. <i>They</i> save my soul, indeed! The likes
o’ thim! Yes, indeed, thin, I had wicked offers
sometimes, and from masters that should have
known better. I kept no company wid young
men. One mistress refused me a karackter, because
I was so unhandy, she said; but she
thought better of it. At last, I had a faver
(fever), and wasn’t expected for long (not expected
to live); when I was getting well, everything
went to keep me. What wasn’t good
enough for the pawn went to the dolly (dolly-shop,
generally a rag and bottle shop, or a marine
store). When I could get about, I was so shabby,
and my clothes hung about me so, that the shops
I went to said, ‘Very sorry, but can’t recommend
you anywhere;’ and mistresses looked strange
at me, and I didn’t know what to do and was
miserable. I’d been miserable sometimes in
place, and had many a cry, and thought how
‘lone’ I was, but I never was so miserable as
this. At last, the old woman I stayed along wid&mdash;O,
yes, she was an Irishwoman&mdash;advised me
to sill fruit in the streets, and I began on strawberries,
and borrowed 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to do it wid. I had
my hilth better than ever thin; and after I’d sold
fruit of all kinds for two years, I got married. My
husband had a potato can thin. I knew him because
he lived near, and I saw him go in and out,
and go to mass. After that he got a porter’s place
and dropped his can, and he porters when he has a
chance still, and has a little work in sewing sacks
for the corn-merchants. Whin he’s at home at
his sacks, as he is now, he can mind the children&mdash;we
have two&mdash;and I sells a few oranges to
make a thrifle. Whin there’s nothing ilse for
him to do, he sills fruit in the sthreets, and thin
I’m at home. We do middlin, God be praised.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt my informant was a modest,
and, in her way, a worthy woman. But it may
be doubted if any English girl, after seven years
of domestic service, would have so readily adapted
herself to a street calling. Had an English girl
been living among, and used to the society of
women who supported themselves by street
labour, her repugnance to such a life might have
been lessened; but even then, I doubt if she,
who had the virtue to resist the offers told of
by my Irish informant, could have made the attempt
to live by selling fruit. I do not mean
that she would rather have fallen into immoral
courses than honestly live upon the sale of strawberries,
but that she would have struggled on and
striven to obtain any domestic labour in preference
to a street occupation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Widow, a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>A woman, apparently about 50, strong-built
and red-faced, speaking in a loud tone, and what
people of her class account a <i>hearty</i> manner, gave
me the following account. I can readily condense
it, for in her street career there was nothing
very novel. She was the daughter of a costermonger,
and she married a costermonger before
she was 20. On my hinting that sometimes
the marriage ceremony was not considered indispensable,
the good woman laughed and said,
“married, or as good, it’s hall as one&mdash;but we
was married.” The marriage was not one of unalloyed
happiness, for the couple often wrangled
and occasionally fought. This was told to me
with some laughter, and with perfect good humour;
for the widow seemed interested to have a
listener. She did not, I feel confident, exaggerate
the merits of the deceased, nor, perhaps, his failings.
He was the best judge of fish in the streets,
she said, and was the neatest hand in cutting it up,
or showing it off; he was not “a bad sort,”
and was very fond of his children. When sober
and at work he was a quiet fellow, without a
cross word for a whole morning, but when drunk,
which was far too often (unless <i>very</i> drunk, and
then he was silly), he went about tearing and
swearing “like one o’clock.” But if he saw his
wife take but a glass or two, to do her good, he
went on like a madman, and as if he never
touched it himself. He never had nothing to
say to other women&mdash;if he had she would have
clawed their eyes out, and his’n too&mdash;he was as
good that way as any nobleman could be, and he
was a fine man to look at; and on a Sunday,
when he dressed hisself, he was beautiful. He
was never in a church in his life, and didn’t
trouble hisself about such things; they was no
concern of his’n.</p>

<p>It may be thought that I have treated this
matter too lightly, but the foregoing is really the
substance, and certainly it is the tone, of the
widow’s talk, which she poured forth freely, without
expressing wonder why any one, a perfect
stranger, cared to listen to such a history. She
needed but a few hints and leading questions to
make her talk on. Nor is this an uncommon
quality even among classes who would be shocked to
be classed, in any respect, with the Widowed Street-Seller.
Their own career, their own sayings and
doings, hopes and disappointments, alone interest
masses of people, and with the simplicity which not
seldom pertains to selfishness, they will readily talk
of all that interests themselves, as if it must necessarily
interest others. On the whole, though the
departed costermonger was greatly deplored by
his widow and family, they did very well without
him, and carry on the business to this day. He
died four or five years back.</p>

<p>I have no doubt this widow is a shrewd saleswoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
enough. I have heard her cry “mack’rel,
live mack’rel, eight a shilling, mack’rel!” and at
other times, “Eight a bob, fine mack’rel, mack’rel,
eight a bob, eight a bob!” On my inquiring
as to the cause of this difference in her cries,
the fish-seller laughed and said, “I cries eight
a bob when I sees people as I thinks is likely
to like slang; to others I cries eight a shilling,
which no doubt is the right way of talking.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Of_the_Children_Street-Sellers_of_London"></a>Of the Children Street-Sellers of
London.</span></h3>

<p>When we consider the spirit of emulation, of imitation,
of bravado, of opposition, of just or idle resentment,
among boys, according to their training,
companionship, natural disposition, and, above all,
home treatment, it seems most important to ascertain
how these feelings and inclinations are fostered
or stimulated by the examples of the free street-life
of other lads to be seen on every side. There
is no doubt that to a large class of boys, whose
parents are not in poverty, the young street ruffian
is a hero.</p>

<p>If this inquiry be important, as it unquestionably
is, concerning boys, how much more important
is it, when it includes the female children of
the streets; when it relates to the sex who, in all
relations of life, and in all grades of society, are
really the guardians of a people’s virtue.</p>

<p>The investigation is, again, rendered more interesting
and more important, when it includes
those children who have known no guidance from
parent, master, or relative, but have been flung
into the streets through neglect, through viciousness,
or as outcasts from utter destitution.
Mixed with the children who really <i>sell</i> in the
streets, are the class who assume to sell that they
may have the better chance to steal, or the greater
facility to beg.</p>

<p>Before I classify what I consider to be the
causes which have driven children to a street
career, with all its hardening consequences, I may
point out that culpability cannot be imputed to
them at the commencement of their course of life.
They have been either untaught, mistaught, maltreated,
neglected, regularly trained to vice, or
fairly turned into the streets to shift for themselves.
The censure, then, is attributable to
parents, or those who should fill the place of
parents&mdash;the State, or society. The exceptions
to this culpability as regards parents are to be
found in the instances where a costermonger employs
his children to aid him in his business
occupation, which the parents, in their ignorance
or prejudices, may account as good as any other,
and the youths thus become unfit, perhaps, for
any other than a scrambling street life. A second
exception may be where the children in a poor
family (as continually happens among the Irish in
London) <i>must</i> sell in the streets, that they may
eat in any place.</p>

<p>In the following details I shall consider all to
be children who are under fifteen years of age.
It is just beyond that age (or the age of puberty)
that, as our prison statistics and other returns
show, criminal dispositions are developed, “self-will”
becomes more imperious and headstrong,
that destructive propensity, or taste, which we term
the ruling passion or character of the individual
is educed, and the destiny of the human being,
especially when apart from the moulding and
well-directed care of parents or friends, is influenced
perhaps for life.</p>

<p><i>The Causes</i>, then, which fill our streets with
children who either manifest the keen and sometimes
roguish propensity of a precocious trader,
the daring and adroitness of the thief, or the
loutish indifference of the mere dull vagabond,
content if he can only eat and sleep, I consider to
be <span class="lock">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The conduct of parents, masters, and mistresses.</p>

<p>2. The companionship and associations formed
in tender years.</p>

<p>3. The employment of children by costermongers
and others who live by street traffic, and
the training of costermongers’ children to a street
life.</p>

<p>4. Orphanhood, friendlessness, and utter destitution.</p>

<p>5. Vagrant dispositions and tastes on the part
of children, which cause them to be runaways.</p>

<p>After this I shall treat of (<i>a</i>) the pursuits of
the street-trading children; (<i>b</i>) their earnings;
(<i>c</i>) the causes or influences which have induced
children to adopt some especial branch of a street
life; (<i>d</i>) their state of education; (<i>e</i>) their morals,
religion, opinions, and conduct; (<i>f</i>) places and
character of dwellings; (<i>g</i>) diet; (<i>h</i>) amusements;
(<i>i</i>) clothing; (<i>j</i>) propensities.</p>

<p>Concerning cause 1, viz., “The conduct of
parents, masters, and mistresses,” I should have
more to say were I treating of the juvenile criminals,
instead of sellers in the streets. The brute
tyranny of parents, manifested in the wreaking
of any annoyances or disappointments they may
have endured, in the passionate beating and
cursing of their children, for trifling or for no
causes, is among the worst symptoms of a depraved
nature. This conduct may be the most
common among the poor, for among them are
fewer conventional restraints; but it exists among
and debases other classes. Some parents only
exercise this tyranny in their fits of drunkenness,
and make that their plea in mitigation; but their
dispositions are then only the more undisguisedly
developed, and they would be equally unjust or
tyrannical when sober, but for some selfish fear
which checks them. A boy perhaps endures this
course of tyranny some time, and then finding it
increase he feels its further endurance intolerable,
and runs away. If he have no friends with whom
he can hope to find a shelter, the streets only are
open to him. He soon meets with comrades,
some of whom perhaps had been circumstanced
like himself, and, if not strongly disposed to idleness
and vicious indulgencies, goes through a
course of horse-holding, errand-running, parcel-carrying,
and such like, and so becomes, if honestly
or prudently inclined, a street-seller, beginning
with fuzees, or nuts, or some unexpensive stock.
The where to buy and the how to sell he will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
plenty to teach him at the lodging-houses, where
he <i>must</i> sleep when he can pay for a bed.</p>

<p>When I was collecting information concerning
brace-selling I met with a youth of sixteen who
about two years previously had run away from
Birmingham, and made his way to London, with
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Although he earned something weekly, he
was so pinched and beaten by a step-mother (his
father was seldom at home except on Sunday)
that his life was miserable. This went on for
nearly a year, until the boy began to resist, and
one Saturday evening, when beaten as usual, he
struck in return, drawing blood from his step-mother’s
face. The father came home before the
fray was well ended; listened to his wife’s statement,
and would not listen to the boy’s, and in
his turn chastised the lad mercilessly. In five
minutes after the boy, with aching bones and a
bitter spirit, left his father’s house and made his
way to London, where he was then vending cheap
braces. This youth could neither read nor write,
and seemed to possess no quickness or intelligence.
The only thing of which he cared to talk
was his step-mother’s treatment of him; all else
was a blank with him, in comparison; this was
the one burning recollection.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that I heard of several
instances of children having run away and adopted
a street life in consequence of the violence of step-mothers
far more than of step-fathers.</p>

<p>I cite the foregoing instance, as the boy’s career
was exactly that I have described; but the reader
will remember, that in the many and curious narratives
I have collected, how often the adult street-seller
has begun such a life by being a runaway
from domestic tyranny. Had this Birmingham
boy been less honest, or perhaps less dull, it
would have been far easier for him to have become
a thief than a street-trader. To the gangs
of young thieves, a new boy, who is not known to
the police is often (as a smart young pickpocket,
then known as the Cocksparrow, described it to
me) “a God-send.”</p>

<p>My readers will remember that in the collected
statements of the street-folk, there are several
accounts of runaways, but they were generally
older than the age I have fixed, and it was necessary
to give an account of one who comes within
my classification of a child.</p>

<p>I did not hear of any girls who had run away
from their homes having become street-sellers
merely. They more generally fall into a course
of prostitution, or sometimes may be ostensibly
street-sellers as a means of accosting men, and,
perhaps, for an attractive pretence to the depraved,
that they are poor, innocent girls, struggling for
an honest penny. If they resort to the low
lodging-houses, where the sexes are lodged indiscriminately,
their ruin seems inevitable.</p>

<p>2. That the companionship and associations
formed in tender years lead many children to a
street life is so evident, that I may be brief on
the subject. There are few who are in the
habit of noting what they may observe of poor
children in the streets and quieter localities,
who have not seen little boys playing at marbles,
or gambling with halfpennies, farthings, or
buttons, with other lads, and who have laid down
their basket of nuts or oranges to take part in
the play. The young street-seller has probably
more halfpence at his command, or, at any rate,
in his possession, than his non-dealing playmates;
he is also in the undoubted possession of what
appears a large store of things for which poor boys
have generally a craving and a relish. Thus the
little itinerant trader is envied and imitated.</p>

<p>This attraction to a street career is very strong,
I have ascertained, among the neglected children
of the poor, when the parents are absent at their
work. On a Saturday morning, some little time
since, I was in a flagged court near Drury-lane,
a wretched place, which was full of children of all
ages. The parents were nearly all, I believe,
then at work, or “on the look out for a job,” as
porters in Covent Garden-market, and the children
played in the court until their return. In one
corner was a group of four or five little boys gambling
and squabbling for nuts, of which one of the
number was a vendor. A sharp-looking lad was
gazing enviously on, and I asked him to guide me
to the room of a man whom I wished to see. He
did so, and I gave him a penny. On my leaving
the court I found this boy the most eager of the
players, gambling with the penny I had given him.
I had occasion to return there a few hours after,
and the same lad was leaning against the wall,
with his hands in his pockets, as if suffering from
listlessness. He had had no luck with the nut covey,
he told me, but he hoped before long to sell nuts
himself. He did not know his age, but he
appeared to be about eleven. Only last week I
saw this same lad hawking a basket, very indifferently
stocked with oranges. He had raised a
shilling, he said, and the “Early Bird” (the nickname
of a young street-seller) had put him up to
the way to lay it out. On my asking if his
father (a journeyman butcher) knew what he was
doing, he replied that so long as he didn’t bother
his father he could do what he pleased, and the
more he kept out of his (the father’s) way the
better he would be liked and treated.</p>

<p>The association of poor boys and girls with the
children of the costermongers, and of the Irish
fruit-sellers, who are employed in itinerant vending,
is often productive of a strong degree of envy
on the part of unemployed little ones, who look
upon having the charge of a basket of fruit, to be
carried in any direction, as a species of independence.</p>

<p>3. “The employment of children by costermongers,
and others who live by street traffic;
and the training of costermongers’ children to a
street life, is the ordinary means of increase among
the street-folk.”</p>

<p>The children of the costermongers become necessarily,
as I have already intimated, street-dealers,
and perhaps more innocently than in any
other manner, by being required, as soon as their
strength enables them, to assist their parents in
their work, or sell trifles, single-handed, for the
behoof of their parents. The child does but obey
his father, and the father does but rear the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
to the calling by which his daily bread is won.
This is the case particularly with the Irish, who
often have large families, and bring them with
them to London.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, a great number of boys,
“anybody’s children,” as I heard them called,
who are tempted and trained to pursue an open-air
traffic, through being engaged by costermongers
or small tradesmen to sell upon commission,
or, as it is termed, for “bunse.” In the curious,
and almost in every instance novel, information
which I gave to the public concerning the largest
body of the street-sellers, the costermongers, this
word “bunse” (probably a corruption of <i>bonus</i>,
<i>bone</i> being the slang for good) first appeared in
print. The mode is this: a certain quantity of
saleable, and sometimes of not very saleable, commodities
is given to a boy whom a costermonger
knows and perhaps employs, and it is arranged
that the young commission-agent is to get a particular
sum for them, which must be paid to the
costermonger; I will say 3<i>s.</i>, that being somewhere
about the maximum. For these articles the lad may
ask and obtain any price he can, and whatever he
obtains beyond the stipulated 3<i>s.</i> is his own profit
or “bunse.” The remuneration thus accruing to
the boy-vendor of course varies very materially,
according to the season of the year, the nature of
the article, and the neighbourhood in which it
is hawked. Much also depends upon whether the
boy has a regular market for his commodities;
whether he has certain parties to whom he is
known and upon whom he can call to solicit custom;
if he has, of course his facilities for disposing
of his stock in trade are much greater than in the
case of one who has only the chance of attracting
attention and obtaining custom by mere crying
and bawling “Penny a piece, Col-ly-flowers,”
“Five bunches a penny, Red-dish-es,” and such
like. The Irish boys call this “having a back,”
an old Hibernian phrase formerly applied to a very
different subject and purpose.</p>

<p>Another cause of the abundance of street-dealers
among the boyish fraternity, whose
parents are unable or unwilling to support them,
is that some costers keep a lad as a regular
assistant, whose duty it is to pull the barrow of
his master about the streets, and assist him in
“crying” his wares. Sometimes the man and the
boy call out together, sometimes separately and
alternately, but mostly the boy alone has to do
this part of the work, the coster’s voice being
generally rough and hoarse, while the shrill sound
of that of the boy re-echoes throughout the street
along which they slowly move, and is far more
likely to strike the ear, and consequently to
attract attention, than that of the man. This
mode of “practising the voice” is, however, perfectly
ruinous to it, as in almost every case of this
description we find the natural tone completely
annihilated at a very early age, and a harsh,
hoarse, guttural, disagreeable mode of speaking
acquired. In addition to the costers there
are others who thus employ boys in the streets:
the hawkers of coal do so invariably, and the
milkmen&mdash;especially those who drive cows or have
a cart to carry the milk-pails in. Once in the
streets and surrounded with street-associates, the
boy soon becomes inured to this kind of life, and
when he leaves his first master, will frequently
start in some branch of costermongering for
himself, without seeking to obtain another constant
employment.</p>

<p>This mode of employing lads, and on the whole
perhaps they are fairly enough used by the costermongers,
and generally treated with great kindness
by the costers’ wives or concubines, is, I am
inclined to think, the chief cause of the abundance
and even increase of the street-sellers of fish,
fruit, and vegetables.</p>

<p>4. To “orphanhood, friendlessness, and utter
destitution,” the commerce of the streets owes a
considerable portion of its merchants. A child finds
himself or herself an orphan; the parents having
been miserably poor, he or she lives in a place
where street-folk abound; it seems the only road
to a meal and a bed, and the orphan “starts” with
a few lucifer-matches, boot-laces, nuts, or onions.
It is the same when a child, without being an orphan,
is abandoned or neglected by the parents,
and, perhaps without any injunctions either for or
against such a course, is left to his or her own will
to sell or steal in the streets.</p>

<p>5. The vagrant dispositions and tastes of lads,
and, it may be, now and then somewhat of a reckless
spirit of adventure, which in our days has far
fewer fields than it once had, is another cause why
a street-life is embraced. Lads have been known
to run away from even comfortable homes through
the mere spirit of restlessness; and sometimes
they have done so, but not perhaps under the age
of fifteen, for the unrestrained indulgence of licentious
passions. As this class of runaways, however,
do not ordinarily settle into regular street-sellers,
but become pickpockets, or trade only
with a view to cloak their designs of theft, I
need not further allude to them under this head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now come to the second part of my subject,
the <i>Pursuits</i>, &amp;c., of the children in street avocations.</p>

<p>As I have shown in my account of the women
street-sellers, there is no calling which this body
of juveniles monopolize, none of which they are
the <i>sole</i> possessors; but some are principally in
their hands, and there are others, again, to which
they rarely incline.</p>

<p>Among the wares sold by the boys and girls of
the streets are:&mdash;money-bags, lucifer-match boxes,
leather straps, belts, firewood (common, and also
“patent,” that is, dipped into an inflammable
composition), fly-papers, a variety of fruits, especially
nuts, oranges, and apples; onions, radishes,
water-cresses, cut flowers and lavender (mostly
sold by girls), sweet-briar, India rubber, garters,
and other little articles of the same material, including
elastic rings to encircle rolls of paper-music,
toys of the smaller kinds, cakes, steel pens
and penholders with glass handles, exhibition
medals and cards, gelatine cards, glass and other
cheap seals, brass watch-guards, chains, and rings;
small tin ware, nutmeg-graters, and other articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of a similar description, such as are easily portable;
iron skewers, fuzees, shirt buttons, boot and
stay-laces, pins (and more rarely needles), cotton
bobbins, Christmasing (holly and other evergreens
at Christmas-tide), May-flowers, coat-studs, toy-pottery,
blackberries, groundsel and chickweed, and
clothes’-pegs.</p>

<p>There are also other things which children sell
temporarily, or rather in the season. This year I
saw lads selling wild birds’-nests with their eggs,
such as hedge-sparrows, minnows in small glass
globes, roots of the wild Early Orchis (Orchis
mascula), and such like things found only out of
town.</p>

<p>Independently of the vending of these articles,
there are many other ways of earning a penny
among the street boys: among them are found&mdash;tumblers,
mud-larks, water-jacks, Ethiopians,
ballad-singers, bagpipe boys, the variety of street
musicians (especially Italian boys with organs),
Billingsgate boys or young “roughs,” Covent Garden
boys, porters, and shoeblacks (a class recently
increased by the Ragged School Brigade). A
great many lads are employed also in giving away
the cards and placards of advertising and puffing
tradesmen, and around the theatres are children
of both sexes (along with a few old people) offering
play-bills for sale, but this is an occupation less
pursued than formerly, as some managers sell their
own bills inside the house and do not allow any
to pass from the hands of the printer into those of
the former vendors. Again: amid the employments
of this class may be mentioned&mdash;the going on
errands and carrying parcels for persons accidentally
met with; holding horses; sweeping crossings
(but the best crossings are usually in the possession
of adults); carrying trunks for any railway traveller
to or from the terminus, and carrying them
from an omnibus when the passenger is not put
down at his exact destination. During the frosty
days of the winter and early spring, some of these
little fellows used to run along the foot-path&mdash;Baker-street
was a favourite place for this display&mdash;and
keep pace with the omnibuses, not
merely by using their legs briskly, but by throwing
themselves every now and then on their hands
and progressing a few steps (so to speak) with
their feet in the air. This was done to attract
attention and obtain the preference if a job were
in prospect; done, too, in hopes of a halfpenny
being given the urchin for his agility. I looked
at the hands of one of these little fellows and the
fleshy parts of the palm were as hard as soling-leather,
as hard, indeed, as the soles of the child’s
feet, for he was bare-footed. At the doors of the
theatres, and of public places generally, boys are
always in waiting to secure a cab from the stand,
their best harvest being when the night has
“turned out wet” after a fine day. Boys
wait for the same purpose, lounging all night,
and until the place closes, about the night-houses,
casinos, saloons, &amp;c., and sometimes
without receiving a penny. There are, again,
the very many ways in which street boys
employed to “help” other people, when temporary
help is needed, as when a cabman must finish the
cleaning of his vehicle in a hurry, or when a
porter finds himself over-weighted in his truck.
Boys are, moreover, the common custodians of the
donkeys on which young ladies take invigorating
exercise in such places as Hampstead-heath and
Blackheath. At pigeon-shooting matches they are
in readiness to pick up the dead birds, and secure
the poor fluttering things which are “hard hit” by
the adventurous sportsman, without having been
killed. They have their share again in the picking
of currants and gooseberries, the pottling of
strawberries, in weeding, &amp;c., &amp;c., and though
the younger children may be little employed in
haymaking, or in the more important labours of
the corn harvest, they have their shares, both with
and without the company of their parents, in the
“hopping.” In fine there is no business carried
on to any extent in the streets, or in the open air,
but it will be found that boys have their portion.
Thus they are brought into contact with all classes;
another proof of what I have advanced touching
the importance of this subject.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that, under this head, I
have had to speak far more frequently of boys
than of girls, for the boy is far more the child of
the streets than is the girl. The female child can
do little but <i>sell</i> (when a livelihood is to be
gained without a recourse to immorality); the
boy can not only sell, but <i>work</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The many ramifications of child-life and of
child-work in our teeming streets, which I have
just enumerated, render it difficult to arrive at a
very nice estimation of the <i>earnings of the street
boys and girls</i>. The gains of this week are not
necessarily the gains of the next; there is the
influence of the weather; there may be a larger
or a smaller number of hands “taking a turn” at
any particular calling this week than in its predecessor;
and, above all, there is that concatenation
of circumstances, which street-sellers include
in one expressive word&mdash;“luck.” I mean
the opportunities to earn a few pence, which on
some occasions present themselves freely, and at
others do not occur at all. Such “luck,” however,
is more felt by the holders of horses, and
the class of waiters upon opportunity (so to speak),
than by those who depend upon trade.</p>

<p>I believe, however, both in consequence of
what I have observed, and from the concurrent
testimony of persons familiar with the child-life of
London streets, that the earnings of the children,
when they are healthful and active, are about the
same in the several capacities they exercise. The
waiter on opportunity, the lad “on the look-out
for a job,” may wait and look out all day bootlessly,
but in the evening some fortunate chance
may realize him “a whole tanner all in a lump.”
In like manner, the water-cress girl may drudge
on from early morning until “cresses” are wanted
for tea, and, with “a connection,” and a tolerably
regular demand, earn no more than the boy’s 6<i>d.</i>,
and probably not so much.</p>

<p>One of the most profitable callings of the street-child
is in the sale of Christmasing, but that is
only for a very brief season; the most regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
returns in the child’s trade, are in the sale of such
things as water-cresses, or any low-priced article
of daily consumption, wherever the youthful
vendor may be known.</p>

<p>I find it necessary to place the earnings of the
street-children higher than those of the aged and
infirm. The children are more active, more
persevering, and perhaps more impudent. They
are less deterred by the weather, and can endure
more fatigue in walking long distances than old
people. This, however, relates to the boys more
especially, some of whom are very sturdy fellows.</p>

<p>The oranges which the street-children now
vend at two a-penny, leave them a profit of 4<i>d.</i>
in the shilling. To take 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> with a profit of
6<i>d.</i> is a fair day’s work; to take 1<i>s.</i> with a profit
of 4<i>d.</i> is a poor day’s work. The dozen bunches
of cut-flowers which a girl will sell on an average
day at 1<i>d.</i> a bunch, cost her 6<i>d.</i>, that sum being
also her profit. These things supply, I think, a
fair criterion. The children’s profits may be 6<i>d.</i>
a day, and including Sunday trade, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week; but with the drawbacks of bad weather,
they cannot be computed at more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week the year through. The boys may earn
2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> a week on an average more than the
girls, except in such things (which I shall specify
under the next head) as seem more particularly
suited for female traffic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Of the causes which influence children to follow
this or that course of business</i> when a street career
has been their choice or their lot, I have little to
say. It seems quite a matter of chance, even
where a preference may exist. A runaway lad
meets with a comrade who perhaps sells fuzees,
and he accordingly begins on fuzees. One youth,
of whom I have given an account (but he was not
of child’s estate), began his street career on fly-papers.
When children are sent into the streets
to sell on account of their parents, they, of course,
vend just what their parents have supplied to
them. If “on their own hook,” they usually
commence their street career on what it is easiest
to buy and easiest to sell; a few nuts or oranges
bought in Duke’s-place, lucifer-boxes, or small
wares. As their experience increases they may
become general street-sellers. The duller sort
will continue to carry on the trades that any one
with ordinary lungs and muscles can pursue.
“All a fellow wants to know to sell potatoes,”
said a master street-seller to me, “is to tell how
many tanners make a bob, and how many yenaps
a tanner.” [How many sixpences make a shilling,
and how many pence a sixpence.] The
smarter and bolder lads ripen into patterers, or
street-performers, or fall into theft. For the
class of adventurous runaways, the patterer’s, or,
rather, the paper-working patterer’s life, with its
alternations of town and country, fairs and hangings,
the bustle of race-grounds and the stillness
of a village, has great attractions. To a pattering
and chaunting career, moreover, there is the stimulus
of that love of approbation and of admiration,
as strong among the often penniless professionals
of the streets as on the boards of the opera house.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is not a child of either sex, now
a street-seller, who would not to-morrow, if they
thought they could clear a penny or two a day
more by it, quit their baskets of oranges and sell
candle-ends, or old bones, or anything. In a
street career, and most especially when united
with a lodging-house existence, there is no daintiness
of the senses and no exercise of the tastes:
the question is not “What do I like best to sell?”
but “What is likely to pay me best?” This cannot
be wondered at; for if a child earn but 5<i>d.</i> a
day on apples, and can make 6<i>d.</i> on onions, its
income is increased by 20 per cent.</p>

<p>The trades which I have specified as in the
hands of street-children are carried on by both
sexes. I do not know that even the stock in
trade which most taxes the strength is more a
boy’s than a girl’s pursuit. A basket of oranges
or of apples is among the heaviest of all the
stocks hawked by children; and in those pursuits
there are certainly as many, or rather more, girls
than boys. Such articles as fly-papers, money-bags,
tins, fuzees, and Christmasing, are chiefly
the boys’ sale; cut-flowers, lavender, water-cresses,
and small wares, are more within the trading of
the girls.</p>

<p>The callings with which children do not meddle
are those which require “patter.” Some of the
boys very glibly announce their wares, and may be
profuse now and then in commendations of their
quality, cheapness, and superiority, but it requires
a longer experience to patter according to the
appreciation of a perhaps critical street audience.
No child, for instance, ventures upon the sale of
grease-removing compositions, corn-salve, or the
“Trial and Execution of Thomas Drory,” with an
“Affecting Copy of Werses.”</p>

<p>A gentleman remarked to me that it was rather
curious that boys’ playthings, such as marbles
and tops, were not hawked by street juveniles,
who might be very well able to recommend them.
I do not remember to have seen any such things
vended by children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Education</i> is, as far as I have been able to
ascertain, more widely extended among street
children than it was twelve or fifteen years ago.
The difficulty in arriving at any conclusion on
such a subject is owing to the inability to find any
one who knew, or could even form a tolerably
accurate judgment of what was the state of education
among these juveniles even twelve years
back.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be sufficiently correct to say that
among a given number of street children, where, a
dozen years ago, you met twenty who could read,
you will now meet upwards of thirty. Of sixteen
children, none apparently fifteen years of age,
whom I questioned on the subject, nine admitted
that they could not read; the other seven declared
that they could, but three annexed to the avowal
the qualifying words&mdash;“a little.” Ten were boys
and six were girls, and I spoke to them promiscuously
as I met them in the street. Two were
Irish lads, who were “working” oranges in company,
and the bigger answered&mdash;“Shure, thin, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
<i>can</i> rade, your honour, sir.” I have little doubt
that they could, but in all probability, had either
of those urchins thought he would be a penny the
better by it, he would have professed, to a perfect
stranger, that he had a knowledge of algebra.
“Yis, sir, I do, thin,” would very likely be his
response to any such inquiry; and when told he
could not possibly know anything about it, he
would answer, “Arrah, thin, but I didn’t understand
your honour.”</p>

<p>To the Ragged Schools is, in all probability,
owing this extension of the ability to read.
It appears that the attendance of the street
children at the Ragged School is most uncertain;
as, indeed, must necessarily be the case where the
whole time of the lad is devoted to obtaining a
subsistence. From the best information I can
collect, it appears that the average attendance of
these boys at these schools does not exceed two
hours per week, so that the amount of education
thus acquired, if education it may be called, must
necessarily be scanty in the extreme; and is
frequently forgotten as soon as learned.</p>

<p>With many of these little traders a natural
shrewdness compensates in some measure for the
deficiency of education, and enables them to carry
on their variety of trades with readiness and dexterity,
and sometimes with exactness. One boy
with whom I had a conversation, told me that
he never made any mistake about the “coppers,”
although, as I subsequently discovered, he had no
notion at all of arithmetic beyond the capability
of counting how many pieces of coin he had, and
how much copper money was required to make a
“tanner” or a “bob.” This boy vended coat-studs:
he had also some metal collars for dogs, or
as he said, “for cats aither.” These articles he
purchased at the same shop in Houndsditch,
where “there was a wonderful lot of other things
to be had, on’y some on ’em cost more money.”</p>

<p>In speaking of money, the slang phrases are
constantly used by the street lads; thus a sixpence
is a “tanner,” a shilling a “bob,” or a
“hog;” a crown is “a bull;” a half-crown “a half
bull,” &amp;c. Little, as a modern writer has remarked,
do the persons using these phrases know
of their remote and somewhat classical origin,
which may, indeed, be traced to the period antecedent
to that when monarchs monopolized the
surface of coined money with their own images
and superscriptions. They are identical with the
very name of money among the early Romans,
which was <i>pecunia</i>, from <i>pecus</i>, a flock. The
collections of coin dealers amply show, that the
figure of a hog was anciently placed on a small
silver coin, and that that of a bull decorated
larger ones of the same metal: these coins were
frequently deeply crossed on the reverse: this was
for the convenience of easily breaking them into
two or more pieces, should the bargain for which
they were employed require it, and the parties
making it had no smaller change handy to complete
the transaction. Thus we find that the
“half-bull” of the itinerant street-seller or “traveller,”
so far from being a phrase of modern invention,
as is generally supposed, is in point of
fact referable to an era extremely remote. Numerous
other instances might be given of the classical
origin of many of the flash or slang words used by
these people.</p>

<p>I now give the answers I received from two
boys. The first, his mother told me, was the
best scholar at his school when he was there, and
before he had to help her in street sale. He was
a pale, and not at all forward boy, of thirteen or
fourteen, and did not appear much to admire being
questioned. He had not been to a Ragged School,
but to an “academy” kept by an old man. He did
not know what the weekly charge was, but when
father was living (he died last autumn) the schoolmaster
used to take it out in vegetables. Father
was a costermonger; mother minded all about his
schooling, and master often said she behaved to
him like a lady. “God,” this child told me, “was
our Heavenly Father, and the maker of all
things; he knew everything and everybody; he
knew people’s thoughts and every sin they committed
if no one else knew it. His was the kingdom
and the power, and the glory, for ever and
ever, Amen. Jesus Christ was our Lord and
Saviour; he was the son of God, and was crucified
for our sins. He was a God himself.”
[The child understood next to nothing of the
doctrine of the Trinity, and I did not press him.]
“The Scriptures, which were the Bible and Testament,
were the Word of God, and contained
nothing but what was good and true. If a boy lied,
or stole, or committed sins,” he said, “he would
be punished in the next world, which endured
for ever and ever, Amen. It was only after
death, when it was too late to repent, that people
went to the next world. He attended chapel,
sometimes.”</p>

<p>As to mundane matters, the boy told me that
Victoria was Queen of Great Britain and Ireland.
She was born May 24, 1819, and succeeded his
late Majesty, King William IV., July 20, 1837.
She was married to his Royal Highness Prince
Albert, &amp;c., &amp;c. France was a different country
to this: he had heard there was no king or queen
there, but didn’t understand about it. You
couldn’t go to France by land, no more than you
could to Ireland. Didn’t know anything of the
old times in history; hadn’t been told. Had
heard of the battle of Waterloo; the English
licked. Had heard of the battle of Trafalgar,
and of Lord Nelson; didn’t know much about
him; but there was his pillar at Charing-cross,
just by the candlesticks (fountains). When
I spoke of astronomy, the boy at once told me he
knew nothing about it. He had heard that the
earth went round the sun, but from what he’d
noticed, shouldn’t have thought it. He didn’t
think that the sun went round the earth, it seemed
to go more sideways. Would like to read more,
if he had time, but he had a few books, and there
was hundreds not so well off as he was.</p>

<p>I am far from undervaluing, indeed I would not
indulge in an approach to a scoff, at the extent of
this boy’s knowledge. Many a man who piques
himself on the plenitude of his breeches’ pocket,
and who attributes his success in life to the fulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
of his knowledge, knows no more of Nature,
Man, and God, than this poor street child.</p>

<p>Another boy, perhaps a few months older, gave
me his notions of men and things. He was a
thick-limbed, red-cheeked fellow; answered very
freely, and sometimes, when I could not help
laughing at his replies, laughed loudly himself, as
if he entered into the joke.</p>

<p>Yes, he had heer’d of God who made the
world. Couldn’t exactly recollec’ when he’d
heer’d on him, but he had, most sarten-ly. Didn’t
know when the world was made, or how anybody
could do it. It must have taken a long time. It
was afore his time, “or yourn either, sir.”
Knew there was a book called the Bible; didn’t
know what it was about; didn’t mind to know;
knew of such a book to a sartinty, because a
young ’oman took one to pop (pawn) for an old
’oman what was on the spree&mdash;a bran new ’un&mdash;but
the cove wouldn’t have it, and the old ’oman said he
might be d&mdash;&mdash;d. Never heer’d tell on the deluge;
of the world having been drownded; it couldn’t,
for there wasn’t water enough to do it. He
weren’t a going to fret hisself for such things as
that. Didn’t know what happened to people after
death, only that they was buried. Had seen a
dead body laid out; was a little afeared at first;
poor Dick looked so different, and when you
touched his face, he was so cold! oh, so cold!
Had heer’d on another world; wouldn’t mind if
he was there hisself, if he could do better, for
things was often queer here. Had heered on it
from a tailor&mdash;such a clever cove, a stunner&mdash;as
went to ’Straliar (Australia), and heer’d him say
he was going into another world. Had never
heer’d of France, but had heer’d of Frenchmen;
there wasn’t half a quarter so many on ’em as of
Italians, with their earrings like flash gals.
Didn’t dislike foreigners, for he never saw none.
What was they? Had heer’d of Ireland. Didn’t
know where it was, but it couldn’t be very far,
or such lots wouldn’t come from there to London.
Should say they walked it, aye, every bit of the
way, for he’d seen them come in, all covered with
dust. Had heer’d of people going to sea, and had
seen the ships in the river, but didn’t know nothing
about it, for he was very seldom that way. The sun
was made of fire, or it wouldn’t make you feel so
warm. The stars was fire, too, or they wouldn’t
shine. They didn’t make it warm, they was too
small. Didn’t know any use they was of. Didn’t
know how far they was off; a jolly lot higher than
the gas lights some on ’em was. Was never in a
church; had heer’d they worshipped God there;
didn’t know how it was done; had heer’d singing
and playing inside when he’d passed; never
was there, for he had’nt no togs to go in, and
wouldn’t be let in among such swells as he had
seen coming out. Was a ignorant chap, for he’d
never been to school, but was up to many a move,
and didn’t do bad. Mother said he would make
his fortin yet.</p>

<p>Had heer’d of the Duke of Wellington; he
was Old Nosey; didn’t think he ever seed him,
but had seed his statty. Hadn’t heer’d of the
battle of Waterloo, nor who it was atween; once
lived in Webber-row, Waterloo-road. Thought he
had heerd speak of Buonaparte; didn’t know
what he was; thought he had heer’d of Shakespeare,
but didn’t know whether he was alive or
dead, and didn’t care. A man with something like
that name kept a dolly and did stunning; but he
was sich a hard cove that if <i>he</i> was dead it
wouldn’t matter. Had seen the Queen, but didn’t
recollec’ her name just at the minute; oh! yes,
Wictoria and Albert. Had no notion what the
Queen had to do. Should think she hadn’t such
power [he had first to ask me what ‘power’ was]
as the Lord Mayor, or as Mr. Norton as was the
Lambeth beak, and perhaps is still. Was never
once before a beak and didn’t want to. Hated
the crushers; what business had they to interfere
with him if he was only resting his basket in a
street? Had been once to the Wick, and once to
the Bower: liked tumbling better; he meant to
have a little pleasure when the peas came in.</p>

<p>The knowledge and the ignorance of these two
striplings represent that of street children generally.
Those who may have run away from a
good school, or a better sort of home as far as
means constitute such betterness, of course form
exceptions. So do the utterly stupid.</p>

<p><i>The Morals, Religion, and Opinions of the
street-trading children</i> are the next topic. Their
business morals have been indicated in the course
of my former statements, and in the general tone
of the remarks and conversation of street-sellers.</p>

<p>As traders their morals may be lax enough.
They give short weight, and they give short measure;
they prick the juice out of oranges; and
brush up old figs to declare they’re new. Their
silk braces are cotton, their buck-leather braces
are wash-leather, their sponge is often rotten, and
their salves and cures quackeries.</p>

<p>Speak to any one of the quicker-witted street-sellers
on the subject, and though he may be
unable to deny that his brother traders are guilty
of these short-comings, he will justify them all
by the example of shopkeepers. One man, especially,
with whom I have more than once conversed
on the subject, broadly asserts that as a
whole the streets are in all matters of business
honester than the shops. “It ain’t <i>we</i>,” runs
the purport of his remarks, “as makes coffee out
of sham chickory; it ain’t <i>we</i> as makes cigars out
of rhubarb leaves; <i>we</i> don’t make duffers handkerchiefs,
nor weave cotton things and call them silk.
If we quacks a bit, does <i>we</i> make fortins by it as
shopkeepers does with their ointments and pills!
If we give slang weights, how many rich shopkeepers
is fined for that there? And how many’s
never found out? And when one on ’em’s fined,
why he calculates how much he’s into pocket,
between what he’s made by slanging, and what
he’s been fined, and on he goes again. <i>He</i> didn’t
know that there ever was short weight given in
his shop: not <i>he</i>! No more do <i>we</i> at our stalls
or barrows! Who ’dulterates the beer? Who
makes old tea-leaves into new? Who grinds rice
among pepper? And as for smuggling&mdash;but nobody
thinks there’s any harm in buying smuggled
things. What <i>we</i> does is like that pencil you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>’re
writing with to a great tree, compared to what the
rich people does. O, don’t tell me, sir, a gentleman
like you that sees so much of what’s going on,
must know <i>we’re</i> better than the shopkeepers are.”</p>

<p>To remarks such as these I have nothing to
answer. It would be idle to point out to such
casuists, that the commission of one wrong can
never justify another. The ignorant reverse the
doctrine of right, and live, not by rule, but by
example. I have unsparingly exposed the
rogueries and trickeries of the street people, and it
is but fair that one of them should be heard in
explanation, if not in justification. The trade
ethics of the adult street-folk are also those of
the juveniles, so on this subject I need dwell no
longer.</p>

<p>What I have said of the religion of the women
street-sellers applies with equal truth to the
children. Their religious feelings are generally
formed for them by their parents, especially their
mothers. If the children have no such direction,
then they have no religion. I did not question
the street-seller before quoted on this subject of
the want of the Christian spirit among his fraternity,
old or young, or he would at once have
asked me, in substance, to tell him in what class
of society the real Christian spirit was to be found?</p>

<p>As to the opinions of the street-children I can
say little. For the most part they have formed
no opinions of anything beyond what affects their
daily struggles for bread. Of politics such
children can know nothing. If they are anything,
they are Chartists in feeling, and are in
general honest haters of the police and of most
constituted authorities, whom they often confound
with the police officer. As to their opinions
of the claims of friendship, and of the duty of
assisting one another, I believe these children feel
and understand nothing about such matters. The
hard struggles of their lives, and the little sympathy
they meet with, make them selfish. There
may be companionship among them, but no
friendship, and this applies, I think, alike to boys
and girls. The boy’s opinion of the girl seems to
be that she is made to help <i>him</i>, or to supply
gratification to his passions.</p>

<p>There is yet a difficult inquiry,&mdash;as to the
opinions which are formed by the young females
reared to a street-life. I fear that those opinions are
not, and cannot be powerfully swayed in favour of
chastity, especially if the street-girl have the quickness
to perceive that marriage is not much honoured
among the most numerous body of street-folk. If she
have not the quickness to understand this, then her
ignorance is in itself most dangerous to her virtue.
She may hear, too, expressions of an opinion that
“going to church to be wed” is only to put money
into the clergyman’s, or as these people say the
“parson’s,” pocket. Without the watchful care
of the mother, the poor girl may form an illicit
connection, with little or no knowledge that she is
doing wrong; and perhaps a kind and indulgent
mother may be herself but a concubine, feeling
little respect for a ceremony she did not scruple to
dispense with. To such opinions, however, the
Irish furnish the exception.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Dwelling-places of the street-children</i> are
in the same localities as I specified regarding the
women. Those who reside with their parents or
employers sleep usually in the same room with
them, and sometimes in the same bed. Nearly
the whole of those, however, who support themselves
by street-trade live, or rather sleep, in the
lodging-houses. It is the same with those who live
by street-vagrancy or begging, or by street-theft;
and for this lazy or dishonest class of children
the worst description of lodging-houses have the
strongest attractions, as they meet continually with
“tramps” from the country, and keep up a constant
current of scheming and excitement.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat curious that, considering the
filth and noisomeness of some of these lodging-houses,
the children who are inmates suffer only
the average extent of sickness and mortality common
to the districts crammed with the poor. Perhaps
it may be accounted for by the circumstance
of their being early risers, and their being in the
open air all day, so that they are fatigued at the
close of the day, and their sleep is deep and unbroken.
I was assured by a well-educated man,
who was compelled to resort to such places, that
he has seen children sleep most profoundly in a
lodging-house throughout a loud and long-continued
disturbance. Many street-children who are either
“alone in the world,” or afraid to return home
after a bad day’s sale, sleep in the markets or
under the dry arches.</p>

<p>There are many other lads who, being unable
to pay the 1<i>d.</i>, 2<i>d.</i>, or 3<i>d.</i> demanded, in pre-payment,
by the lodging-house keepers, pass the
night in the streets, wherever shelter may be
attainable. The number of outcast boys and girls
who sleep in and about the purlieus of Covent
Garden-market each night, especially during the
summer months, has been computed variously, and
no doubt differs according to circumstances; but
those with whom I have spoken upon the subject,
and who of all others are most likely to
know, consider the average to be upwards of
200.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Diet of the street-children</i> is in some
cases an alternation of surfeit and inanition, more
especially that of the stripling who is “on his
own hook.” If money be unexpectedly attained,
a boy will gorge himself with such dainties as he
loves; if he earn no money, he will fast all day
patiently enough, perhaps drinking profusely of
water. A cake-seller told me that a little while
before I saw him a lad of twelve or so had consumed
a shilling’s worth of cakes and pastry, as
he had got a shilling by “fiddling;” not, be it
understood, by the exercise of any musical skill,
for “fiddling,” among the initiated, means the
holding of horses, or the performing of any odd
jobs.</p>

<p>Of these cakes and pastry&mdash;the cakes being
from two to twelve a penny, and the pastry, tarts,
and “Coventrys” (three-cornered tarts) two a penny&mdash;the
street-urchins are very fond. To me they
seemed to possess no recommendation either to the
nose or the palate. The “strong” flavour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
these preparations is in all probability as grateful
to the palate of an itinerant youth, as is the high
<i>gout</i> of the grouse or the woodcock to the fashionable
epicure. In this respect, as in others which
I have pointed out, the “extremes” of society
“meet.”</p>

<p>These remarks apply far more to the male than
to the female children. Some of the street-boys
will walk a considerable distance, when they are
in funds, to buy pastry of the Jew-boys in the
Minories, Houndsditch, and Whitechapel; those
keen traders being reputed, and no doubt with
truth, to supply the best cakes and pastry of any.</p>

<p>A more staple article of diet, which yet partakes
of the character of a dainty, is in great demand by
the class I treat of&mdash;pudding. A halfpenny or
a penny-worth of baked plum, boiled plum (or
plum dough), currant or plum batter (batter-pudding
studded with raisins), is often a dinner.
This pudding is almost always bought in the shops;
indeed, in a street apparatus there could hardly
be the necessary heat diffused over the surface
required; and as I have told of a distance being
travelled to buy pastry of the Jew-boys, so is it
traversed to buy pudding at the best shops. The
proprietor of one of those shops, upon whom I
called to make inquiries, told me that he sold
about 300 pennyworths of pudding in a day. Two-thirds
of this quantity he sold to juveniles
under fifteen years of age; but he hadn’t noticed
particularly, and so could only guess. This
man, when he understood the object of my
inquiry, insisted upon my tasting his “batter,”
which really was very good, and tasted&mdash;I do not
know how otherwise to describe it&mdash;honest. His
profits were not large, he said, and judging from
the size and quality of his oblong halfpenny and
pennyworth’s of batter pudding, I have no doubt
he stated the fact. “There’s many a poor man
and woman,” he said, “aye, sir, and some that
you would think from their appearance might go
to an eating-house to dine, make a meal off my
pudding, as well as the street little ones. The
boys are often tiresome: ‘Master,’ they’ll say,
‘can’t you give us a plummier bit than this?’ or,
‘Is it just up? I likes it ’ot, all ’ot.’”</p>

<p>The “baked tatur,” from the street-dealer’s can
more frequently than from the shops, is another
enjoyable portion of the street child’s diet. Of
the sale to the juvenile population of pickled
whelks, stewed eels, oysters, boiled meat puddings,
and other articles of street traffic, I have spoken
under their respective heads.</p>

<p>The Irish children who live with their parents
fare as the parents fare. If very poor, or if bent
upon saving for some purpose, their diet is tea and
bread and butter, or bread without butter. If not
so <i>very</i> poor, still tea, &amp;c., but sometimes with a
little fish, and sometimes with a piece of meat on
Sundays; but the Sunday’s meat is more common
among the poor English than the poor Irish street-traders;
indeed the English street-traders generally
“live better” than the Irish. The coster-boys
often fare well and abundantly.</p>

<p>The children living in the lodging-houses, I
am informed, generally, partake only of such
meals as they can procure abroad. Sometimes of
a night they may partake of the cheap beef or
mutton, purveyed by some inmate who has been
“lifting flesh” (stealing meat) or “sawney”
(bacon). Vegetables, excepting the baked potato,
they rarely taste. Of animal food, perhaps, they
partake more of bacon, and relish it the most.</p>

<p>Drinking is not, from what I can learn, common
among the street boys. The thieves are generally
sober fellows, and of the others, when they are
“in luck,” a half-pint of beer, to relish the bread
and saveloy of the dinner, and a pennyworth of
gin “to keep the cold out,” are often the extent
of the potations. The exceptions are among the
ignorant coster-lads, who when they have been
prosperous in their “bunse,” drink, and ape the
vices of men. The girls, I am told, are generally
fonder of gin than the boys. Elderwine and
gingerbeer are less popular among children than
they used to be. Many of the lads smoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Amusements of the street-children</i> are such
as I have described in my account of the costermongers,
but in a moderate degree, as those who
partake with the greatest zest of such amusements
as the Penny Gaff (penny theatre) and the Twopenny
Hop (dance) are more advanced in years.
Many of the Penny Gaffs, however, since I last
wrote on the subject, have been suppressed, and
the Twopenny Hops are not half so frequent as
they were five or six years back. The Jew-boys
of the streets play at draughts or dominoes in
coffee-shops which they frequent; in one in the
London-road at which I had occasion to call were
eight of these urchins thus occupied; and they
play for money or its equivalent, but these
sedentary games obtain little among the other and
more restless street-lads. I believe that not one-half
of them “know the cards,” but they are fond
of gambling at pitch and toss, for halfpennies or
farthings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Clothing of the street-children</i>, however
it may vary in texture, fashion, and colour, has
one pervading characteristic&mdash;it is never made
for the wearers. The exceptions to this rule
seem to be those, when a child has run away and
retains, through good fortune or natural acuteness,
the superior attire he wore before he made the
choice&mdash;if choice he had&mdash;of a street life; and
where the pride of a mother whose costermonger
husband is “getting on,” clothes little Jack or
Bill in a new Sunday suit. Even then the suit
is more likely to be bought ready-made than
“made to measure,” nor is it worn in business
hours until the gloss of novelty has departed.</p>

<p>The boys and girls wear every variety of clothing;
it is often begged, but if bought is bought
from the fusty stocks of old clothes in Petticoat
and Rosemary-lanes. These rags are worn by the
children as long as they will hold, or can be tied
or pinned together, and when they drop off from
continued wear, from dirt, and from the ravages
of vermin, the child sets his wits to work to
procure more. One mode of obtaining a fresh
supply is far less available than it was three or
four years back. This was for the lads to denude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
themselves of their rags, and tearing them up in
the casual-ward of a workhouse, as it were compel
the parish-officers to provide them with fresh
apparel.</p>

<p>This mode may be successful in parts of the
country still, but it is not so, or to a very limited
extent, in town. The largest, and what was accounted
by the vagrants the most liberal, of all
the casual wards of the metropolitan workhouses,
that of Marylebone, has been closed above two
years. So numerous were the applicants for admission,
and so popular among the vagrants was
Marylebone workhouse, that a fever resulted, and
attacked that large establishment. It was not
uncommon for the Irish who trudged up from
Liverpool, to be advised by some London vagrant
whom they met, to go at once, when they reached
the capital, to Marylebone workhouse, and that
the Irishman might not forget a name that was
new to him, his friendly adviser would write it
down for him, and a troop of poor wretched Irish
children, with parents as wretched, would go to
Marylebone workhouse, and in their ignorance or
simplicity, present the address which had been
given to them, as if it were a regular order for
admission! Boys have sometimes committed offences
that they might get into prison, and as
they contrived that their apparel should be unfit
for purposes of decency, or perhaps their rags had
become unfit to wear, they could not be sent
naked into the streets again, and so had clothing
given to them. A shirt will be worn by one of
those wretched urchins, without washing, until it
falls asunder, and many have no shirts. The
girls are on the whole less ragged than the boys,
the most disgusting parts of their persons or apparel&mdash;I
speak here more of the vagrant or the
mixed vagrant trading and selling girl (often a
child prostitute) than of the regular street-seller&mdash;the
worst particular of these girls’ appearance, I
repeat, is in their foul and matted hair, which
looks as if it would defy sponge, comb, and brush
to purify it, and in the broken and filthy boots
and stockings, which they seem never to button or
to garter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Propensities of the street-children</i> are
the last division of my inquiry, and an ample
field is presented, alike for wonder, disgust, pity,
hope, and regret.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of
these wretched children is their extraordinary
licentiousness. Nothing can well exceed the extreme
animal fondness for the opposite sex which
prevails amongst them; some rather singular
circumstances connected with this subject have
come to my knowledge, and from these facts it
would appear that the age of puberty, or something
closely resembling it, may be attained at a
much less numerical amount of years than that at
which most writers upon the human species have
hitherto fixed it. Probably such circumstances as
the promiscuous sleeping together of both sexes,
the example of the older persons indulging in the
grossest immorality in the presence of the young,
and the use of obscene expressions, may tend to
produce or force an unnatural precocity, a precocity
sure to undermine health and shorten life.
Jealousy is another characteristic of these children,
and perhaps less among the girls than the boys.
Upon the most trivial offence in this respect, or
on the suspicion of an offence, the “gals” are
sure to be beaten cruelly and savagely by their
“chaps.” This appears to be a very common case.</p>

<p>The details of filthiness and of all uncleanness
which I gave in a recent number as things of
course in certain lodging-houses, render it unnecessary
to dwell longer upon the subject, and
it is one from which I willingly turn to other
matters.</p>

<p>In addition to the licentious, the vagabond propensities
of this class are very striking. As soon
as the warm weather commences, boys and girls,
but more especially boys, leave the town in shoals,
traversing the country in every direction; some
furnished with trifling articles (such as I have
already enumerated) to sell, and others to begging,
lurking, or thieving. It is not the street-sellers
who so much resort to the tramp, as those
who are devoid of the commonest notions of
honesty; a quality these young vagrants sometimes
respect when in fear of a gaol, and the
hard work with which such a place is identified
in their minds&mdash;and to which, with the peculiar
idiosyncrasy of a roving race, they have an insuperable
objection.</p>

<p>I have met with boys and girls, however, to
whom a gaol had no terrors, and to whom, when
in prison, there was only one dread, and that a
common one among the ignorant, whether with or
without any sense of religion&mdash;superstition. “I
lay in prison of a night, sir,” said a boy who was
generally among the briskest of his class, “and
think I shall see things.” The “things” represent
the vague fears which many, not naturally
stupid, but untaught or ill-taught persons, entertain
in the dark. A girl, a perfect termagant in
the breaking of windows and such like offences,
told me something of the same kind. She spoke
well of the treatment she experienced in prison,
and seemed to have a liking for the matron and
officials; her conduct there was quiet and respectful.
I believe she was not addicted to drink.</p>

<p>Many of the girls, as well as the boys, of course
trade as they “tramp.” They often sell, both in
the country and in town, little necklaces, composed
of red berries strung together upon thick
thread, for dolls and children: but although I
have asked several of them, I have never yet
found one who collected the berries and made the
necklaces themselves; neither have I met with a
single instance in which the girl vendors knew
the name of the berries thus used, nor indeed
even that they <i>were</i> berries. The invariable reply
to my questions upon this point has been that
they “are called necklaces;” that “they are just
as they sells ’em to us;” that they “don’t know
whether they are made or whether they grow;”
and in most cases, that they “gets them in London,
by Shoreditch;” although in one case a little
brown-complexioned girl, with bright sparkling
eyes, said that “she got them from the gipsies.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
At first I fancied, from this child’s appearance,
that she was rather superior in intellect to most
of her class; but I soon found that she was not a
whit above the others, unless, indeed, it were in
the possession of the quality of cunning.</p>

<p>Some of the boys, on their country excursions,
trade in dominoes. They carry a variety of
boxes, each differing in size and varying accordingly
in price: the lowest-priced boxes are
mostly 6<i>d.</i> each (sometimes 4<i>d.</i>, or even 3<i>d.</i>), the
highest 1<i>s.</i> An informant told me that these
boxes are charged to him at the rate of 20 to 25
per cent. less; but if, as is commonly the case, he
could take a number at a time, he would have
them at a smaller price still. They are very
rudely made, and soon fall to pieces, unless
handled with extreme care. Most of the boys
who vend this article play at the game themselves,
and with some skill; but in every case,
I believe, there is a willingness to cheat, or
take advantage, which is hardly disguised; one
boy told me candidly that those who make the
most money are considered to be the cleverest,
whether by selling or cheating, or both, at the
game; nor can it be said that this estimation of
cleverness is peculiar to these children.</p>

<p>At this season of the year great numbers of the
street-children attend the races in different parts
of the country, more especially at those in the
vicinity of a large town. The race-course of Wolverhampton,
for instance, is usually thronged with
them during the period of the sport. While taking
these perigrinations they sometimes sleep in the
low lodging-houses with which most of our provincial
towns abound: frequently “skipper it” in
the open air, when the weather is fine and warm,
and occasionally in barns or outhouses attached to
farms and cottages. Sometimes they travel in
couples&mdash;a boy and a girl, or two boys or two
girls; but the latter is not so common a case as
either of the former. It is rare that more than
two may be met in company with each other,
except, indeed, of a night, and then they usually
herd together in numbers. The boys who carry
dominoes sometimes, also, have a sheet of paper
for sale, on which is rudely printed a representation
of a draught-board and men&mdash;the latter of
which are of two colours (black and white) and
may be cut out with a pair of scissors; thus forming
a ready means of playing a game so popular
in rustic places. These sheets of paper are sold
(if no more can be got for them) at a penny each.
The boy who showed them to me said he gave
a halfpenny a piece for them, or 6<i>d.</i> for fifteen.
He said he always bought them in London, and
that he did not know any other place to get them
at, nor had “ever heard any talk of their being
bought nowhere else.”</p>

<p>The extraordinary lasciviousness of this class
which I have already mentioned, appears to continue
to mark their character during their vagabondizing
career in the country as fully as in
town; indeed, an informant, upon whom I think
I may rely, says, that the nightly scenes of youthful
or even childish profligacy in the low lodging-houses
of the small provincial towns quite equal&mdash;even
if they do not exceed&mdash;those which may
be witnessed in the metropolis itself. Towards
the approach of winter these children (like the
vagrants of an older growth) advance towards
London; some remain in the larger towns, such as
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield,
&amp;c., but the greater proportion appear to return
to the metropolis, where they resume the life they
had previously led, anything but improved in
education, morals, manners, or social position
generally, by their summer’s excursion.</p>

<p>The language spoken by this rambling class is
peculiar in its construction: it consists of an odd
medley of cockneyfied English, rude provincialisms,
and a large proportion of the slang commonly
used by gipsies and other “travellers,” in conveying
their ideas to those whom they wish to
purchase their commodities.</p>

<p>Among the propensities of the street-boys I do
not think that pugnacity, or a fondness, or even a
great readiness, for fighting, is a predominant
element. Gambling and thieving may be rife
among a class of these poor wretches; and it may
not unfrequently happen that force is resorted to
by one boy bigger than another to obtain the
halfpence of which the smaller child is known to
be possessed. Thus quarrels among them are very
frequent, but they rarely lead to fighting. Even
in the full swing and fury of their jealousy, it
does not appear that these boys attack the object
of their suspicions, but prefer the less hazardous
course of chastising the delinquent or unjustly
suspected girl. The girls in the low lodging-houses,
I was told a little time since, by a woman
who used to frequent them, sometimes, not often,
scratched one another until the two had bloody
faces; and they tried to bite one another
now and then, but they seldom fought. What
was this poor woman’s notion of a fight between
two girls, it may not be very easy to comprehend.</p>

<p>The number of children out daily in the streets
of London, employed in the various occupations I
have named, together with others which may
possibly have been overlooked&mdash;including those
who beg without offering any article for sale&mdash;those
who will work as light porters, as errand
boys and the like, for chance passengers, has been
variously calculated; probably nothing like exactitude
can be hoped for, much less expected, in
such a speculation, for when a government census
has been so frequently found to fail in correctness
of detail, it appears highly improbable that the
number of those so uncertain in their places of
resort and so migratory in their habits, can be
ascertained with anything like a definite amount
of certainty by a private individual. Taking the
returns of accommodation afforded to these children
in the casual wards of workhouses, refuges for the
destitute and homeless poor; of the mendicity and
other societies of a similar description, and those
of our hospitals and gaols,&mdash;and these sources of
information upon this subject can alone be confidently
relied upon,&mdash;and then taking into the
calculation the additional numbers, who pass the
night in the variety of ways I have already
enumerated, I think it will be found that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
number of boys and girls selling in the streets of
this city, and often dependent upon their own
exertions for the commonest necessaries of life,
may be estimated at some thousands, but nearer
10,000 than 20,000.</p>

<p>The consideration which I have devoted to this
branch of my subject has been considerable, but
still not, in my own opinion, commensurate to the
importance of its nature. Steps ought most unquestionably
to be taken to palliate the evils and
miseries I have pointed out, even if a positive
remedy be indeed impossible.</p>

<p>Each year sees an increase of the numbers of
street-children to a very considerable extent, and
the exact nature of their position may be thus
briefly depicted: what little <i>information</i> they
receive is obtained from the worst class&mdash;from
cheats, vagabonds, and rogues; what little <i>amusement</i>
they indulge in, springs from sources the
most poisonous&mdash;the most fatal to happiness and
welfare; what little they know of a <i>home</i> is necessarily
associated with much that is vile and base;
their very means of existence, uncertain and precarious
as it is, is to a great extent identified with
petty chicanery, which is quickly communicated by
one to the other; while their physical sufferings
from cold, hunger, exposure to the weather, and
other causes of a similar nature, are constant, and
at times extremely severe. Thus every means by
which a proper intelligence may be conveyed to
their minds is either closed or at the least tainted,
while every duct by which a bad description of
knowledge may be infused is sedulously cultivated
and enlarged. Parental instruction; the comforts
of a home, however humble&mdash;the great moral
truths upon which society itself rests;&mdash;the influence
of proper example; the power of education;
the effect of useful amusement; are all denied to
them, or come to them so greatly vitiated, that
they rather tend to increase, than to repress, the
very evils they were intended to remedy.</p>

<p>The costers invariably say that no persons under
the age of fifteen should be allowed by law to vend
articles in the streets; the reason they give for
this is&mdash;that the children under that period of life
having fewer wants and requiring less money to
live than those who are older, will sell at a less
profit than it is fair to expect the articles sold should
yield, and thus they tersely conclude, “they pervents
others living, and ruins theirselves.”</p>

<p>There probably is truth in this remark, and I
must confess that, for the sake of the children
themselves, I should have no objection to see
the suggestion acted upon; and yet there immediately
rises the plain yet startling question&mdash;in
such a case, what is to become of the children?</p>

<p>I now cite the histories of street-lads belonging
to the several classes above specified, as illustrations
of the truth of the statements advanced
concerning the children street-sellers generally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Children sent out as Street-Sellers by
their Parents.</span></h3>

<p>Of the boys and girls who are sent out to sell in
the streets by parents who are themselves street-traders,
I need say but little under this head. I
have spoken of them, and given some of their statements
in other divisions of this work (see the
accounts of the coster boys and girls). When, as
is the case with many of the costermongers, and
with the Irish fruit-sellers, the parents and
children follow the same calling, they form one
household, and work, as it were, “into one another’s
hands.” The father can buy a larger, and consequently
a cheaper quantity, when he can avail
himself of a subdivision of labour as inexpensive
as that of his own family&mdash;whom he must maintain
whether employed or unemployed&mdash;in order
to vend such extra quantity. I have already
noticed that in some families (as is common with
rude tribes) costermongering seems an hereditary
pursuit, and the frequent and constant employment
of children in street traffic is one reason why
this hereditary pursuit is perpetuated, for street
commerce is thus at a very early age made part
and parcel of the young coster’s existence, and he
very probably acquires a distaste for any other
occupation, which may entail more of <i>restraint</i>
and <i>irksomeness</i>. It is very rarely that a costermonger
apprentices his son to any handicraft business,
although a daughter may sometimes be placed
in domestic service. The child is usually “sent
out to sell.”</p>

<p>There is another class of children who are “sent
out” as are the children of the costers, and sometimes
with the same cheap and readily attained
articles&mdash;oranges and lemons, nuts, chestnuts,
onions, salt (or fresh) herrings, winks, or shrimps,
and, more rarely, with water-cresses or cut-flowers.
Sometimes the young vendors offer small wares&mdash;leather
boot-laces, coat-studs, steel pens, or such
like. These are often the children, not of street
sales-people, but of persons in a measure connected
with a street life, or some open-air pursuit; the
children of cabmen deprived of their licences, or of
the hangers-on of cabmen; of the “supers” (supernumeraries)
of the theatres who have irregular or
no employment, or, as they would call it, “engagement,”
with the unhappy consequence of irregular
or no “salary:” the children, again, of street
performers, or Ethiopians, or street-musicians,
are “sent out to sell,” as well as those of the
poorer class of labourers connected with the river&mdash;ballast-heavers,
lumpers, &amp;c.; of (Irish) bricklayers’
labourers and paviours’ assistants; of
market-porters and dock-labourers; of coal-heavers
out of work, and of the helpers at coal-wharfs,
and at the other wharfs; of the Billingsgate
“roughs;” and of the many classes of the labouring,
rather than the artisan poor, whose earnings
are uncertain, or insufficient, or have failed them
altogether.</p>

<p>With such classes as these (and more especially
with the Irish), as soon as Pat or Biddy is big
enough to carry a basket, and is of sufficiently
ripened intellect to understand the relative value
of coins, from a farthing to a shilling, he or she
<i>must</i> do something “to help,” and that something
is generally to sell in the streets. One poor woman
who made a scanty living in working on corn sacks
and bags&mdash;her infirmities sometimes preventing her
working at all&mdash;sent out three children, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
or separately, to sell lucifer-matches or small
wares. “<i>They like it</i>,” she said, “<i>and always
want to be off into the streets</i>; and when my
husband (a labourer) was ill in the hospital, the
few pence they brought in was very useful; but
now he’s well and at work again and we want to
send the eldest&mdash;she’s nine&mdash;to school; <i>but they
all</i> will <i>go out to sell if they can get hold of any
stock</i>. I would never have sent them at all if I
could have helped it, but if they made 6<i>d.</i> a day
among the three of them, perhaps it saved their
lives when things were at the worst.” If a poor
woman, as in this instance, has not been used to
street-selling herself, there is always some neighbour
to advise her what to purchase for her
children’s hawking, and instruct her where.</p>

<p>From one little girl I had the following account.
She was then selling boot-laces and offered them
most perseveringly. She was turned nine, she
said, and had sold things in the streets for two
years past, but not regularly. The father got his
living in the streets by “playing;” she seemed
reluctant to talk about his avocation, but I found
that he was sometimes a street-musician, or street-performer,
and sometimes sung or recited in public
houses, and having “seen better days,” had it
appears communicated some feeling of dislike for
his present pursuits to his daughter, so that I discontinued
any allusion to the subject. The mother
earned 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> weekly, in shoe-binding, when
she had employment, which was three weeks out
of four, and a son of thirteen earned what was
sufficient to maintain him as an (occasional)
assistant in a wholesale pottery, or rather pot-shop.</p>

<p>“It’s in the winter, sir, when things are far
worst with us. Father can make very little then&mdash;but
I don’t know what he earns exactly at any
time&mdash;and though mother has more work then,
there’s fire and candle to pay for. We were very
badly off last winter, and worse, I think, the winter
before. Father sometimes came home and had
made nothing, and if mother had no work in hand
we went to bed to save fire and candle, if it was
ever so soon. Father would die afore he would
let mother take as much as a loaf from the parish.
I was sent out to sell nuts first: ‘If it’s only 1<i>d.</i>
you make,’ mother said, ‘it’s a good piece of
bread.’ I didn’t mind being sent out. I knew
children that sold things in the streets. Perhaps
I liked it better than staying at home without a
fire and with nothing to do, and if I went out I saw
other children busy. No, I wasn’t a bit frightened
when I first started, not a bit. Some children&mdash;but
they was such little things&mdash;said: ‘O, Liz, I wish
I was you.’ I had twelve ha’porths and sold them
all. I don’t know what it made; 2<i>d.</i> most likely.
I didn’t crack a single nut myself. I was fond of
them then, but I don’t care for them now. I could
do better if I went into public-houses, but I’m
only let go to Mr. Smith’s, because he knows
father, and Mrs. Smith and him recommends me
and wouldn’t let anybody mislest me. Nobody
ever offered to. I hear people swear there sometimes,
but it’s not at me. I sell nuts to children
in the streets, and laces to young women. I have
sold nuts and oranges to soldiers. They never say
anything rude to me, never. I was once in a
great crowd, and was getting crushed, and there
was a very tall soldier close by me, and he lifted
me, basket and all, right up to his shoulder, and
carried me clean out of the crowd. He had stripes
on his arm. ‘I shouldn’t like you to be in such
a trade,’ says he, ‘if you was my child.’ He didn’t
say why he wouldn’t like it. Perhaps because it
was beginning to rain. Yes, we are far better off
now. Father makes money. I don’t go out in
bad weather in the summer; in the winter,
though, I must. I don’t know what I make.
I don’t know what I shall be when I grow up.
I can read a little. I’ve been to church five or
six times in my life. I should go oftener and so
would mother, if we had clothes.”</p>

<p>I have no reason to suppose that in this case
the father was an intemperate man, though some of
the parents who thus send their children out <i>are</i>
intemperate, and, loving to indulge in the idleness
to which intemperance inclines them, are forced to
live on the labour of their wives and children.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a “Neglected” Child, a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>Of this class perhaps there is less to be said than
of others. Drunken parents allow their children
to run about the streets, and often to shift for
themselves. If such parents have any sense of
shame, unextinguished by their continued besottedness,
they may feel relieved by not having
their children before their eyes, for the very sight
of them is a reproach, and every rag about such
helpless beings must carry its accusation to a
mind not utterly callous.</p>

<p>Among such children there is not, perhaps,
that extreme pressure of wretchedness or of privation
that there is among the orphans, or the utterly
deserted. If a “neglected child” have to shift,
wholly or partly, for itself, it is perhaps with the
advantage of a shelter; for even the bare room of
the drunkard is in some degree a shelter or roof.
There is not the nightly need of 2<i>d.</i> for a bed, or
the alternative of the Adelphi arches for nothing.</p>

<p>I met with one little girl ten or eleven years of
age, whom some of the street-sellers described to
me as looking out for a job every now and then. She
was small-featured and dark-eyed, and seemed
intelligent. Her face and hands were brown as if
from exposure to the weather, and a lack of soap;
but her dress was not dirty. Her father she described
as a builder, probably a bricklayer’s
labourer, but he could work, she said, at drains or
such like. “Mother’s been dead a long time,”
the child continued, “and father brought another
woman home and told me to call her mother, but
she soon went away. I works about the streets,
but only when there’s nothing to eat at home.
Father gets drunk sometimes, but I think not so
oft as he did, and then he lies in bed. No, sir,
not all day, but he gets up and goes out and
gets more drink, and comes back and goes to
bed again. He never uses me badly. When
he’s drinking and has money, he gives me some
now and then to get bread and butter with,
or a halfpenny pudding; he never eats anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
in the house when he’s drinking, and he’s a
very quiet man. Sometimes he’s laid in bed
two or three days and nights at a time. I goes
to school when father has money. We lives
very well then. I’ve kept myself for a whole
week. I mind people’s stalls, if they’re away a
bit, and run for them if they’re wanted; and I go
errands. I’ve carried home flower-pots for a lady.
I’ve got a halfpenny on a day, and a penny, and
some bread perhaps, and I’ve lived on that. I
should like very well to have a pitch of my own.
<i>I think I should like that better than place.</i> But
I have a sister who has a place in the country;
she’s far older than I am, and perhaps I shall get
one. But father’s at work now, and he says he’ll
take the pledge. Five or six times I’ve sold
oranges, and ingans as well, and carried the money
to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, who gave me all I took above 4<i>d.</i>
for myself.”</p>

<p>It could surprise no one if a child so neglected
became so habituated to a street life, that she
could not adapt herself to any other. I heard of
other children thus or similarly neglected, but
boys far more frequently than girls, who traded regularly
in apples, oranges, &amp;c., on their own
account. Some have become regular street-sellers,
and even in childhood have abandoned their
homes and supported themselves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Hired Coster Boy.</span></h3>

<p>One shell-fish seller, who has known street-commerce
and street-folk for many years, thought,
although he only hazarded an opinion, that
there was less drinking among the young costers,
and less swearing, than he had known in a preceding
generation.</p>

<p>A young coster boy living with his parents,
who had a good business, told me that he would
never be nothing but a “general dealer,” (which
among some of these people is the “genteel”
designation for a costermonger,) as long as he
lived, unless, indeed, he rose to a coal shed and
a horse and cart; a consummation, perhaps with
the addition of a green-grocery, a fried fish,
and a gingerbeer trade, not unfrequently arrived
at by the more prudent costermongers. This
boy could neither read nor write; he had been
sent to school, and flogged to school (he grinned
as he told me) by his mother, who said his
father wouldn’t have been “done” so often by fine
folks, when he sold “grass” (asparagus) and such
things as cost money, if he could have kept
’count. But his father only laughed, and said
nothing, when the boy “cut away” from school,
which he did so continuously, that the schoolmaster
at length declined the charge of the young
coster’s further education. This stripling, who
was about fourteen, seemed very proud of a pair
of good half-boots which his mother had bought
him, and which he admired continually as he
glanced at his feet. His parents, from his account,
were indulgent, and when they got farthings in
change or in any manner, kept them for him;
and so he got treats, and smart things to wear
now and then. “We expects to do well,” he
said, for he used the “we” when he spoke of
his parents’ business, “when it’s peas and
new potatoes, cheap enough to cry. It’s my
dodge to cry. I know a man as says, ‘May
month ought to be ashamed on itself, or things ’ud
a been herlier.’ Last week I sung out, it was
the same man’s dodge, he put me up to it&mdash;‘Here’s
your Great Exhibition mackarel.’ People laughed,
but it weren’t no great good. I’ve been to Penny
Gaffs, but not this goodish bit. I likes the singing
best as has a stunnin chorus. There’s been a
deal of hard up lately among people as is general
dealers. Things is getting better, I think, and
they must. It wouldn’t do at all if they didn’t.
It’s no use your a-asking me about what I
thinks of the Queen or them sort of people, for I
knows nothing about them, and never goes among
them.”</p>

<p>The Hired boys, for the service of the costermongers,
whether hired for the day, or more permanently,
are very generally of the classes I have
spoken of. When the New Cut, Lambeth, was a
great street-market, every morning, during the
height of the vegetable and fruit seasons, lads
used to assemble in Hooper-street, Short-street,
York-street, and, indeed, in all the smaller streets
or courts, which run right and left from the “two
Cuts.” When the costermonger started thence,
perhaps “by the first light,” to market, these boys
used to run up to his barrow, “D’you want me,
Jack?” or, “Want a boy, Bill?” being their constant
request. It is now the same, in the localities
where the costermongers live, or where they
keep their ponies, donkeys, and barrows, and
whence they emerge to market. It is the same at
Billingsgate and the other markets at which these
traders make their wholesale purchases. Boys
wait about these marts “to be hired,” or, as they
may style it, to “see if they’re wanted.” When
hired, there is seldom any “wage” specified, the
lads seeming always willing to depend upon the
liberality of the costermonger, and often no doubt
with an eye to the chances of “bunse.” A sharp
lad thus engaged, who may acquit himself to a
costermonger’s liking, perhaps continues some
time in the same man’s employ. I may observe,
that in this gathering, and for such a purpose,
there is a resemblance to the simple proceedings
of the old times, when around the market cross
of the nearest town assembled the population
who sought employment, whether in agricultural
or household labour. In some parts of the north
of England these gatherings are still held at the
two half-yearly terms of May-day and Martinmas.</p>

<p>A lad of thirteen or fourteen, who did not look
very strong, gave me the following account: “I
helps, you see, sir, where I can, for mother (who
sells sheep’s-trotters) depends a deal on her trotters,
but they’re not great bread for an old ’oman, and
there’s me and Neddy to keep. Father’s abroad
and a soger. Do I know he is? Mother says so,
sir. I looks out every morning when the costermongers
starts for the markets and wants boys
for their barrows. I cried roots last: ‘Here’s
your musks, ha’penny each. Here’s yer all agro’in’
and all a blo’in’.’ I got my grub and 3<i>d.</i> I takes
the tin home. If there’s a cabbage or two left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
I’ve had it guv to me. <i>I likes that work better
nor school. I should think so. One sees life.</i>
Well, I don’t know wot one sees perticler; but
it’s wot people calls life. I was a week at
school once. I has a toss up sometimes when
I has a odd copper for it. I ’aven’t ’ad any rig’lar
work as yet. I shall p’raps when it’s real
summer.” [Said, May 24th.] “This is the Queen’s
birthday, is it, sir? Werry likely, but she’s
nothing to me. I can’t read, in coorse not, after a
week’s schooling. Yes, I likes a show. Punch is
stunnin’, but they might make more on the dog. I
would if I was a Punch. O, I has tea, and bread
and butter with mother, and gets grub as I jobs
besides. I makes no bargain. If a cove’s scaly,
we gets to know him. I hopes to have a barrer
of my own some day, and p’raps a hass. Can I
manage a hass? <i>In</i> coorse, and he don’t want no
groomin’. I’d go to Hepsom then; I’ve never been
yet, but I’ve been to Grinnage fairs. I don’t
know how I can get a barrer and a hass, but I
may have luck.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of an Orphan Boy, a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>From one of this class I had the following account.
It may be observed that the lad’s statement contains
little of incident, or of novelty, but this is
characteristic of many of his class. With many
of them, it may indeed be said, “one day certifieth
another.” It is often the same tale of labour and
of poverty, day after day, so that the mere
uniformity makes a youth half oblivious of the
past; the months, or perhaps years, seem all
alike.</p>

<p>This boy seemed healthy, wore a suit of corduroy,
evidently not made for him, and but little
patched, although old; he was in good spirits.</p>

<p>“I believe I’m between fifteen and sixteen,”
he said, “and mother died more than two year
ago, nearer three, perhaps. Father had gone dead
a long time afore; I don’t remember him.” [I am
inclined to think that this story of the death of the
father is often told by the mother of an illegitimate
child to her offspring, through a natural repugnance
to reveal her shame to her child. I do not
know, however, that it was the case in this
instance.] “I don’t remember about mother’s
funeral, for I was ill myself at the time. She
worked with her needle; sometimes for a dressmaker,
on “skirts,” and sometimes for a tailor, on
flannels. She sometimes worked all night, but
we was wery badly off&mdash;we was so. She had
only me. When mother died there was nothing
left for me, but there was a good woman&mdash;she
was a laundress and kept a mangle&mdash;and she said,
‘well, here’s a old basket and a few odd things;
give the kid the basket and turn the bits of old
traps into money, and let him start on muffins, and
then he must shift for hisself.’ So she tuk me to a
shop and I was started in the muffin line. I didn’t
do so bad, but it’s on’y a winter trade, isn’t
muffins. I sold creases next&mdash;no, not creases,
cherries; yes, it was creases, and then cherries,
for I remembers as ’ow ’Ungerford was the first
market I ever was at; it was so. Since then, I’ve
sold apples, and oranges, and nuts, and chestnuts&mdash;but
<i>they</i> was dear the last time as I had ’em&mdash;and
spring garters a penny a pair, and glass pens;
yes, and other things. I goes to market, mostly to
Common Gard’n, and there’s a man goes there
what buys bushels and bushels, and he’ll let me
have any little lot reas’nable; he will so. There’s
another will, but he ain’t so good to a poor kid.
Well, I doesn’t know as ’ow one trade’s better
nor another; I think I’ve done as much in
one as in another. But I’ve done better lately;
I’ve sold more oranges, and I had a few
sticks of rhubarb. I think times is mending,
but others says that’s on’y my luck. I sleeps
with a boy as is younger nor I am, and pays 9<i>d.</i>
a week. Tom’s father and mother&mdash;he’s a coal-heaver,
but he’s sometimes out of work&mdash;sleeps in
the same room, but we has a good bed to ourselves.
Tom’s father knew my mother. There’s
on’y us four. Tom’s father says sometimes if his
rheumatics continues, he and all on ’em must go
into the house. Most likely I should then go to
a lodging-house. I don’t know that some on ’em’s
bad places. I’ve heer’d they was jolly. I has no
amusements. Last year I helped a man one day,
and he did so well on fruit, he did so, for he got
such a early start, and so cheap, that he gave me
3<i>d.</i> hextra to go to the play with. I didn’t go.
I’d rather go to bed at seven every night than
anywhere else. I’m fond of sleep. I never wakes
all night. I dreams now and then, but I never
remembers a dream. I can’t read or write; I
wish I could, if it would help me on. I’m
making 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week now, I think. Some weeks
in winter I didn’t make 2<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>This boy, although an orphan at a tender age,
was yet assisted to the commencement of a business
by a friend. I met with another lad who
was left under somewhat similar circumstances.
The persons in the house where his mother had
died were about to take him to the parish officers,
and there seemed to be no other course to be
pursued to save the child, then nearly twelve,
from starvation. The lad knew this and ran away.
It was summer time, about three years ago, and
the little runaway slept in the open air whenever
he could find a quiet place. Want drove him
to beg, and several days he subsisted on one penny
which he begged. One day he did not find any
one to give him even a halfpenny, and towards
the evening of the second he became bold, or even
desperate, from hunger. As if by a sudden impulse
he went up to an old gentleman, walking
slowly in Hyde-park, and said to him, “Sir, I’ve
lived three weeks by begging, and I’m hungering
now; give me sixpence, or I’ll go and steal.” The
gentleman stopped and looked at the boy, in whose
tones there must have been truthfulness, and in
whose face was no doubt starvation, for without
uttering a word he gave the young applicant a
shilling. The boy began a street-seller’s life on
lucifer-matches. I had to see him for another
purpose a little while ago, and in the course of
some conversation he told me of his start in the
streets. I have no doubt he told the truth, and I
should have given a more detailed account of him,
but when I inquired for him, I found that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
gone to Epsom races to sell cards, and had not returned,
having probably left London on a country
tour. But for the old gentleman’s bounty he
would have stolen something, he declared, had it
been only for the shelter of a prison.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Life of an Orphan Girl, a Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>“Father was a whitesmith,” she said, “and mother
used to go out a-washing and a-cleaning, and me
and my sister (but she is dead now) did nothing;
we was sent to a day school, both of us. We lived
very comfortable; we had two rooms and our own
furniture; we didn’t want for nothing when
father was alive; he was very fond on us both,
and was a kind man to everybody. He was took
bad first when I was very young&mdash;it was consumption
he had, and he was ill many years, about
five years, I think it was, afore he died. When
he was gone mother kept us both; she had plenty
of work; she couldn’t a-bear the thought of our
going into the streets for a living, and we was
both too young to get a place anywhere, so we
stayed at home and went to school just as when
father was alive. My sister died about two year
and a half ago; she had the scarlet-fever dreadful,
she lay ill seven weeks. We was both very fond
of her, me and mother. I often wish she had
been spared, I should not be alone in the world
as I am now. We might have gone on together,
but it is dreadful to be quite alone, and I often
think now how well we could have done if she
was alive.</p>

<p>“Mother has been dead just a year this month;
she took cold at the washing and it went to her chest;
she was only bad a fortnight; she suffered great
pain, and, poor thing, she used to fret dreadful, as
she lay ill, about me, for she knew she was going to
leave me. She used to plan how I was to do when
she was gone. She made me promise to try to get
a place and keep from the streets if I could, for
she seemed to dread them so much. When she
was gone I was left in the world without a
friend. I am quite alone, I have no relation at
all, not a soul belonging to me. For three months
I went about looking for a place, as long as my
money lasted, for mother told me to sell our
furniture to keep me and get me clothes. I could
have got a place, but nobody would have me
without a character, and I knew nobody to give
me one. I tried very hard to get one, indeed I
did; for I thought of all mother had said to me
about going into the streets. At last, when my
money was just gone, I met a young woman in
the street, and I asked her to tell me where I
could get a lodging. She told me to come with
her, she would show me a respectable lodging-house
for women and girls. I went, and I have
been there ever since. The women in the house
advised me to take to flower-selling, as I could get
nothing else to do. One of the young women took
me to market with her, and showed me how to
bargain with the salesman for my flowers. At
first, when I went out to sell, I felt so ashamed I
could not ask anybody to buy of me; and many
times went back at night with all my stock, without
selling one bunch. The woman at the lodging-house
is very good to me; and when I have a
bad day she will let my lodging go until I can
pay her. She always gives me my dinner, and a
good dinner it is, of a Sunday; and she will often
give me a breakfast, when she knows I have no
money to buy any. She is very kind, indeed, for
she knows I am alone. I feel very thankful to
her, I am sure, for all her goodness to me.
During the summer months I take 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
day, which is 6<i>d.</i> profit. But I can only sell
my flowers five days in the week&mdash;Mondays
there is no flowers in the market: and of the 6<i>d.</i>
a day I pay 3<i>d.</i> for lodging. I get a halfpenny-worth
of tea; a halfpenny-worth of sugar; one
pound of bread, 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; butter, &frac12;<i>d.</i> I never tastes
meat but on Sunday. What I shall do in the
winter I don’t know. In the cold weather last
year, when I could get no flowers, I was forced
to live on my clothes, I have none left now but
what I have on. What I shall do I don’t know&mdash;I
can’t bear to think on it.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Two Runaway Street-Boys.</span></h3>

<p>I endeavoured to find a boy or girl who belonged
to the <i>well</i>-educated classes, had run away, and
was now a street-seller. I heard of boys of this
class&mdash;one man thought he knew five, and was
sure of four&mdash;who now lived by street-selling, my
informant believed without having any recourse to
theft, but all these boys were absent; they had
not returned from Epsom, or had not returned to
their usual haunts, or else they had started for
their summer’s excursion into the country. Many
a street-seller becomes as weary of town after
the winter as a member of parliament who sits
out a very long session; and the moment the
weather is warm, and “seems settled,” they are
off into the country. In this change of scene
there is the feeling of independence, of freedom;
<i>they</i> are not “tied to their work;” and this
feeling has perhaps even greater charms for the
child than the adult.</p>

<p>The number of lads of a <i>well-educated class</i>,
who support themselves by street-selling, is not
large. I speak of those whom I have classed as
children under fifteen years of age. If a boy run
away, scared and terrified by the violence of a
parent, or maddened by continuous and sometimes
excessive severity, the parent often feels compunction,
and I heard of persons being sent to every
lodging-house in London, and told to search every
dry arch, to bring back a runaway. On these
occasions the street-sellers willingly give their
aid; I have even heard of women, whose degradation
was of the lowest, exerting themselves
in the recovery of a runaway child, and that often
unsolicited and as often unrecompensed.</p>

<p>The children who are truants through their own
vicious or reckless propensities, or through the inducements
of their seniors, become far more frequently,
thieves or lurkers, rather than street-sellers.
As to runaway girls of a well-educated
class, and under fifteen, I heard of none who were
street-sellers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>I now give instances of two runaway lads, who
have been dishonest, and honest.</p>

<p>The one, when he told me his history, was a
slim and rather tall young man of 23 or 24,
with a look, speech, and air, anything but vulgar.
He was the son of a wealthy jeweller, in a town
in the West of England, and ran away from home
with an adult member of his father’s establishment,
who first suggested such a course, taking
with them money and valuables. They came to
London, and the elder thief, retaining all the
stolen property, at once abandoned the child, then
only ten, and little and young-looking for his age.
He fell into the hands of some members of the
swell-mob, and became extremely serviceable to
them. He was dressed like a gentleman’s son,
and was innocent-looking and handsome. His
appearance, when I saw him, showed that this
must have been the case as regards his looks. He
lived with some of the swell-mobsmen&mdash;then a more
prosperous people than they are now&mdash;in a good
house in the Southwark-Bridge-road. The women
who resided with the mobsmen were especially
kind to him. He was well fed, well lodged, well
clad, and petted in everything. He was called
“the kid,” a common slang name for a child, but
he was <i>the</i> kid. He “went to work” in Regent-street,
or wherever there were most ladies, and
his appearance disarmed suspicion. He was,
moreover, highly successful in church and chapel
practice. At length he became “spotted.” The
police got to know him, and he was apprehended,
tried, and convicted. He was, however&mdash;he believed
through the interest of his friends, of whose
inquiries concerning him he had heard, but of that
I know nothing&mdash;sent to the Philanthropic Asylum,
then in St. George’s-road. Here he remained
the usual time, then left the place well clothed, and
with a sum of money, and endeavoured to obtain
some permanent employment. In this endeavour
he failed. Whether he exerted himself strenuously
or not I cannot say, but he told me that the very
circumstance of his having been “in the Philanthropic”
was fatal to his success. His “character”
and “recommendations” necessarily showed where
he had come from, and the young man, as he
then was, became a beggar. His chief practice
was in “screeving,” or writing on the pavement.
Perhaps some of my readers may remember
having noticed a wretched-looking youth who
hung over the words “I AM STARVING,”
chalked on the footway on the Surrey side of
Waterloo Bridge. He lay huddled in a heap,
and appeared half dead with cold and want, his
shirtless neck and shoulders being visible through
the rents in his thin jean jacket; shoe or stocking
he did not wear. This was the rich jeweller’s son.
Until he himself told me of it&mdash;and he seemed
to do so with some sense of shame&mdash;I could
not have believed that the well-spoken and well-looking
youth before me was the piteous object I
had observed by the bridge. What he is doing
now I am unable to state.</p>

<p>Another boy, who thought he was not yet fifteen,
though he looked older, gave me the following
account. He was short but seemed strong,
and his career, so far, is chiefly remarkable for his
perseverance, exercised as much, perhaps, from insensibility
as from any other quality. He was
sufficiently stupid. If he had parents living, he
said, he didn’t know nothing about them; he had
lived and slept with an old woman who said she
was his grandmother, and he’d been told that she
weren’t no relation; he didn’t trouble himself
about it. She sold lucifer-boxes or any trifle
in the streets, and had an allowance of 2<i>s.</i>
weekly, but from what quarter he did not know.
About four years ago he was run over by a cab,
and was carried to the workhouse or the hospital;
he believed it was Clerkenwell Workhouse, but
he weren’t sure. When he recovered and was
discharged he found the old woman was dead, and
a neighbour went with him to the parish officers,
by whom&mdash;as well as I could understand him&mdash;he
was sent to the workhouse, after some inquiry.
He was soon removed to Nor’ud. On my asking
if he meant Norwood, he replied, “no, Nor’ud,”
and there he was with a number of other children
with a Mr. Horbyn. He did not know how long
he was there, and he didn’t know as he had anything
much to complain of, but he ran away. He
ran away because he thought he would; and he
believed he could get work at paper-staining. He
made his way to Smithfield, near where there was
a great paper-stainer’s, but he could not get any
work, and he was threatened to be sent back, as
they knew from his dress that he had run away.
He slept in Smithfield courts and alleys, fitting
himself into any covered corner he could find. The
poor women about were kind to him, and gave
him pieces of bread; some knew that he had run
away from a workhouse and was all the kinder.
“The fust browns as ivver I yarned,” he said, “was
from a drover. He was a going into the country to
meet some beasts, and had to carry some passels
for somebody down there. They wasn’t ’evvy,
but they was orkerd to grip. His old ’oman luk
out for a young cove to ’elp her old man, and saw
me fust, so she calls me, and I gets the job. I
gived the greatest of satisfaction, and had sixpence
giv me, for Jim (the drover) was well paid, as
they was vallyble passels, and he said he’d taken
the greatest of care on ’em, and had engaged a
poor lad to ’elp him.” On his return the child
slept in a bed, in a house near Gray’s-inn-lane,
for the first time since he had run away, he believed
about a fortnight. He persevered in looking
out for odd jobs, without ever stealing, though
he met some boys who told him he was a fool not
to prig. “I used to carry his tea from his old
’oman,” he went on, “to a old cove as had a
stunnin’ pitch of fruit in the City-road. But my
best friend was Stumpy; he had a beautiful
crossin’ (as a sweeper) then, but he’s dead now
and berried as well. I used to talk to him and
whistle&mdash;I <i>can</i> just whistle” [here he whistled
loud and shrill, to convince me of his perfection
in that street accomplishment] “&mdash;and to dance
him the double-shuffle” [he favoured me with a
specimen of that dance], “and he said I hinterested
him. Well, he meant he liked it, I s’pose. When
he went to rest hisself, for he soon got tired, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
his drop of beer to his grub, I had his crossin’
and his broom for nuff’n. One boy used to say to
Stumpy, ‘I’ll give you 1<i>d.</i> for your crossin’
while you’s grubbin.’ But I had it for nuff’n,
and had all I yarned; sometimes 1<i>d.</i>, sometimes
2<i>d.</i>, but only once 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> I’ve been ’elping Old
Bill with his summer cabbages and flowers (cauliflowers),
and now he’s on live heels. I can sing
’em out prime, but you ’eared me. I has my bit
o’ grub with him, and a few browns, and Old Bill
and Young Bill, too, says I shall have better to
do, but I can’t until peas. I sleeps in a loft with
’ampers, which is Old Bill’s; a stunnin’ good bed.
I’ve cried for and ’elped other costers. Stumpy
sent me to ’em. I think he’d been one hisself, but
I was always on the look-out. I’ll go for some
bunse soon. I don’t know what I shall do time
to come, I nivver thinks on it. I could read middlin’,
and can a little now, but I’m out of practice.”</p>

<p>I have given this little fellow’s statement somewhat
fully, for I believe he is a type of the most
numerous class of runaway urchins who ripen, so
to speak, into costermongers, after “helping” that
large body of street-traders.</p>

<p>I heard of one boy who had been discharged
from Brixton, and had received 6<i>d.</i> to begin the
world with, as it was his first offence, on his way
back to London, being called upon suddenly as
soon as he had reached the New Cut (then the
greatest of all the street-markets) to help a costermonger.
This gave the boy a start, and he had
since lived honestly.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_CAPITAL_AND_INCOME_OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_MANUFACTURED_ARTICLES"></a>OF THE CAPITAL AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF
MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.</h2>
</div>


<p>Before giving a Summary of the Capital and
Income of the above-mentioned class, I shall endeavour
to arrive at some notion as to the number
of persons belonging to this division of the London
Street-sellers.</p>

<p>As far as I am able to ascertain, the following
estimate may be taken as an approximation to the
truth. There are in the metropolis 100 hardware-sellers,
6 cheap Johns, 30 sellers of cutlery,
6 sellers of tailors’ needles, 20 sellers of metal
spoons, 500 sellers of jewellery, 2 sellers of card
counters, 15 sellers of medals, 6 sellers of rings
and sovereigns for a wager, 25 sellers of children’s
gilt watches, 100 sellers of tin-ware, 100 swag-barrowmen,
12 sellers of dog-collars, &amp;c., 40 sellers
of tools, 380 sellers of crockery and glass-wares,
12 sellers of spar-ornaments, 30 sellers of China-ornaments,
6 sellers of stone-fruit, 120 packmen
and duffers or hawkers of soft wares, 500 sellers
of tapes, cottons, &amp;c., 100 sellers of lace, 15
sellers of japanned table covers, 500 brace and
belt-sellers, 50 sellers of hose, 3 sellers of waistcoats,
230 sellers of blacking, 125 sellers of black-lead,
5 sellers of French polish, 7 sellers of grease-removing
composition, 4 sellers of plating-balls,
8 sellers of corn-salve, 4 sellers of China and
glass cement, 6 sellers of razor paste, 55 sellers of
crackers and detonating-balls, 200 sellers of
Lucifer matches, 100 sellers of cigar-lights, 30
sellers of gutta-percha heads, 50 sellers of fly-papers
and beetle-wafers, 25 sellers of poison for
rats, 35 sellers of walking-sticks, 30 sellers of
whips, 4 sellers of clay and Meerschaum pipes, 15
sellers of tobacco-boxes, snuff-boxes, and cigar-cases,
100 sellers of cigars, 50 sellers of sponge,
200 sellers of wash-leathers, 35 sellers of spectacles,
and eye-glasses, 50 sellers of dolls, 50 lot-sellers,
2 sellers of Roulette tables, 4 sellers of
rhubarb, 100 rat-catchers, 50 sellers of combs, 50
sellers of money-bags, 70 sellers of coat-studs;
making altogether a total of 4272.</p>

<p>Some few of the above trades are, however, of
only a temporary character; as, for instance, such
as are engaged in the street-sale of crackers and
detonating-balls&mdash;the month of November and the
Christmas week being the only regular periods, with
the exception of fairs and races, for the vending of
those articles. The fly-papers and beetle-wafers
are other instances of the same kind&mdash;summer
being the only season in which there is a demand
for such things. Making due allowance therefore
for the temporary character of some of the callings,
as well as for the itinerancy and unsettledness of
other trades or traders, we may, I think, safely assume
that the street-sellers connected with this
class are about 4000 in number.</p>

<p>Concerning the amount of capital invested in
this branch of the street-traffic as well as the
income derived therefrom, the following tables are
given as being somewhat near the truth.</p>

The cabbages, turnips, &amp;c. are brought in loads to the great wholesale markets, a load varying from 150
to 200 dozen, but being more frequently nearer 200, and not unfrequently to fully that amount. Not to perplex
my reader with too great a multiplicity of figures in a tabular arrangement, I have given the quantity of
individual articles in a load, without specifying it. In the smaller market (for vegetables) of Portman, the
cabbages, &amp;c., are not conveyed in waggons, as to the other markets, but in carts containing generally sixty
dozens.</p></div>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
